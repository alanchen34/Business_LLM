         "Johannes Moser continues his successful foray into the cello music repertoire of Brahms and his contemporaries in this Volume II of his series of recordings.  Originally recorded in 2000 it is interesting to hear the present state of maturity in Moser's performances in today's concert halls.  Not that the playing here is anything but excellent but the richness of his tone and the sensitivity of his phrasing as a cellist has grown.  But it is to his credit that he is so committed to his craft that he would delve into a study of the music for his instrument by his beloved Brahms and include the other composers of Brahms' time who were creating cello sonatas also.  In this recording he is joined by the accomplished pianist Paul Rivinius and the result is a study in collaboration as well as a partnership in introducing works seldom heard today.<br /><br />The first work is Richard Strauss' Cello Sonata in F major and it is doubtful that anyone who is familiar with Strauss' opera scores could mistake this sonata for cell and piano to be by any other composer!  The work may not be a profound one, but it soars in Straussian seemingly endless lines.  It is a work well worth hearing frequently.  The second piece is by an all by forgotten contemporary of Brahms - Heinrich von Herzogenberg - and for obvious reasons. The sonata is his Cello Sonata #3, and without the previous two sonatas at hand to compare it is difficult to say whether this work shows any growth or sophistication.  Both Moser and Rivinius give it their all but there is not a lot of substance here.<br /><br />The Brahms Cello Sonata #1 in E minor is the highlight of the album.  Moser (and Rivinius) have a special affinity for the music of Brahms and the quality of their playing is sumptuous, paying the respect to Brahms' academic classical line attention as well as to his flights into pure Romanticism.  It is a warmly beautiful performance and the acoustic of the recording space is excellent.  A remarkable addition to the record library.  Grady Harp, February 12ibrary.  Grady Harp, February 12",

Then go right to the heart of it with an interesting cover of of the hallowed \\\"Whipping Post\\\". Fear and trepidation cast aside like so many other sacred cows they put their twist on this song and both pay homage to it and reconstruct it into a stripped down guttural anthem that captures the lonely side of the pain.<br /><br />Whoa, is that a Bill Withers riff on \\\"Damage Is Done\\\"? No doubt, but it sure is a funky riff that captures the essence of the aftermath of a relation.

The band offers her a solid base to work from while being able to challenge her with a wall of sound that propels her to the next level.<br />Title track \\\"Detoxing\\\" features an instrumental prologue that creates a psychedelic wave form from which Heidi casts an intoxicating mix of eastern sounding vocals that fit right into that groove and takes us along to ride the tide.<br /><br />Everything in moderation, including moderation see what I mean on blues411.com on the [...]",

         "Amazing album marred by a few cheesy tracks",
         "Seventh Wonder is a progressive power metal band hailing from Sweden. They’ve mostly flown under the radar until recently, when their lead singer Tommy Karevik joined the more popular American power metal outfit Kamelot. When Kamelot’s latest album Silverthorn was released in October of this year it received great critical acclaim, a lot of the praise focusing on the new singer. Some said that as good as Tommy Karevik performs with Kamelot on Silverthorn, Seventh Wonder is still a better band by comparison. That’s where my interest got piqued and what led me to look into Seventh Wonder’s latest album called The Great Escape.<br /><br />The first song on the album, Wizeman, blew me away. The guitarists provide a twisting and constant barrage of chugging riffage while Karevik somehow manages to sing catchy melodies over them, all the while showing off his impressive vocal range. Karevik immediately stands out from the rest of the band and though some of the instrumental breakdowns are impressive, the music just doesn’t carry much weight without him.<br /><br />For the most part, Karevik wisely avoids the lyrical cheese that is so prominent in this genre. But there are a few exceptions. Exceptions so devastating as to nearly destroy the entire package (but not quite).<br /><br />The second song, Alley Cat, comes in naturally and seems to keep the catchy progressiveness going. There’s nothing better than getting a new CD and finding that each song that plays is as good as or better than the last. And at first glance that is the case with this track…until you hear the lyrics. I’m a fan of power metal, I can handle some cheese, it just comes with the territory, but this goes beyond acceptable.<br /><br />This album suffers in a weird way. There are six stand alone tracks and one thirty minute epic track at the end. It feels like Karevik excised all the cheese from four of the tracks and then crammed it all into the other three. Having to skip songs on a CDas you listen is an album killer for me. My solution was to delete the three offenders (Alley Kat, Long Way Home, and Move on Through) and take in the album once more in its new abridged format.<br /><br />What a difference! The album went from fatally flawed to sheer brilliance. And it still clocks in at fifty-two minutes with three songs cut out. Unfortunately, not everyone picking this album up is going to be as brutally proactive as I in carving it up into the masterpiece it should have been, so that has to be weighed into the final verdict.<br /><br />The Great Escape is an exceptional album with a couple of glaring flaws that nearly destroy the whole thing. If you’re not a power metal fan to begin with, this isn’t going to win you over. However, if you are into this genre or can appreciate music for what it is within its own genre, then I highly recommend you give this album a listen. Just skip the audio abortions mentioned above and you’ll be left with candy and roses.",

         "The album is not as poor as some of the reviews would make it out to be.  Sure, the continual flow from \\\"Random Album Title\\\" is non-existent, but songs like \\\"Closer,\\\" \\\"Fn Pig,\\\" and the ingenious \\\"There Might Be Coffee\\\" are structured much in the same vein as the aforementioned album.  Of course, you've already heard \\\"Professional Griefers,\\\" which in my opinion is a great song, even with the addition of vocals.  Look...deadmau5 is obviously now more popular than ever and open to all sorts of scrutiny, but at the end of the day -- as a PRODUCER -- he is a master of his craft.  I do not, however, blame anyone who shall discontinue listening after \\\"October,\\\" simply because for me, the album stops there.  Many of the negative reviews make note of the oddly-placed Cypress Hill collaboration, \\\"Failbait,\\\" and I will admit, it is quite random.  I won't necessarily say that it is a bad song, but it serves as more of a throwaway bonus track than anything...as does \\\"Sleepless\\\" and \\\"Telemiscommunications.\\\"  Take the first ten tracks in as an album by itself and it'll become clear that this is indeed a deadmau5 record.  The buildups, transitions, and climaxes are all there, but temper your expectations.  This is nothing new or ground-breaking, yet serves as a more-than-satisfactory album in a world of increasingly-muddled and generic EDM...<br /><br />1) Superliminal:  4/5.  Nice intro/kick in the head.  Similar to \\\"FML.\\\"<br /><br />2) Channel 42: 4/5.  Solid material here.  Similar to \\\"Hi Friend\\\" and \\\"Moar Ghosts.\\\"<br /><br />3) The Veldt: 3.5/5.  Somewhat similar to \\\"I Remember,\\\" but not really.  Just a really chill tune.<br /><br />4) Fn Pig:  4.5/5.  Similar to \\\"Bad Selection,\\\" but the intro/various sound effects are quite reminiscent of the Megaman video game franchise...lol.<br /><br />5) Professional Griefers:  4.5/5.  Of course, you know this one.  Similar to \\\"Sofi Needs a Ladder.\\\"<br /><br />6) Maths:  3.5/5.  Catchy tune, but different.  Difficult to compare to previous work...actually somewhat similar to Justice's \\\"Phantom.\\\"<br /><br />7) There Might Be Coffee:  5/5.  Far and away, the best song on the album and a career top-10 landmark track.  Again, some nostalgic Megaman-ish sounds throughout...but damn, do they fit (seriously, Google Megaman if you are confused).  Similar to \\\"Aural Synapse\\\" and dare I say it, \\\"Strobe.\\\"  Yeah...I cannot stress this enough...it is THAT good.<br /><br />8) Take Care of the Proper Paperwork:  3/5.  Meh...this one isn't bad, but serves more as a transition between the two marvels that sandwich it.  Sounds like a collaboration that might have occurred between NIN and Prodigy...though an actual collaboration of that magnitude might make this very song shrivel up and die of humiliation.<br /><br />9) Closer:  5/5.  The other gem of the album.  What starts off like a \\\"red yellow green blue green\\\" SIMON sound effect (which might also be recognized from the \\\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\\" film), quickly sweeps you far away to a random Asian paradise...simply masterful.  There are certainly some elements uncannily reminiscent to \\\"Slip,\\\" yet the track climaxes nicely into something akin to \\\"Not Exactly.\\\"<br /><br />10) October: 4/5.  Good tune...but not necessarily great (just wished it climaxed into something greater).  However, it is the last TRUE piece of what deserves to constitute as one cohesive album.  Similar to \\\"HR 8938 Cephei.\\\"<br /><br />I won't even go into tracks 11-13 because as I have already mentioned, I don't quite consider them part of the album, but instead as simple \\\"bonus tracks.\\\"  Go into the album expecting some great building tracks that you've come to expect from \\\"The Mau5\\\" and disregard most of the negative feedback.  Give it a few spins and judge for yourself...work...actually somewhat similar to Justice's \\\"Phantom.\\\"<br /><br />7) There Might Be Coffee:  5/5.

         "Johannes Moser Continues his survey of Brahms and Contemporaries",
         "Johannes Moser continues his successful foray into the cello music repertoire of Brahms and his contemporaries in this Volume II of his series of recordings.  Originally recorded in 2000 it is interesting to hear the present state of maturity in Moser's performances in today's concert halls.  Not that the playing here is anything but excellent but the richness of his tone and the sensitivity of his phrasing as a cellist has grown.  But it is to his credit that he is so committed to his craft that he would delve into a study of the music for his instrument by his beloved Brahms and include the other composers of Brahms' time who were creating cello sonatas also.  In this recording he is joined by the accomplished pianist Paul Rivinius and the result is a study in collaboration as well as a partnership in introducing works seldom heard today.<br /><br />The first work is Richard Strauss' Cello Sonata in F major and it is doubtful that anyone who is familiar with Strauss' opera scores could mistake this sonata for cell and piano to be by any other composer!  The work may not be a profound one, but it soars in Straussian seemingly endless lines.  It is a work well worth hearing frequently.  The second piece is by an all by forgotten contemporary of Brahms - Heinrich von Herzogenberg - and for obvious reasons. The sonata is his Cello Sonata #3, and without the previous two sonatas at hand to compare it is difficult to say whether this work shows any growth or sophistication.  Both Moser and Rivinius give it their all but there is not a lot of substance here.<br /><br />The Brahms Cello Sonata #1 in E minor is the highlight of the album.  Moser (and Rivinius) have a special affinity for the music of Brahms and the quality of their playing is sumptuous, paying the respect to Brahms' academic classical line attention as well as to his flights into pure Romanticism.  It is a warmly beautiful performance and the acoustic of the recording space is excellent.  A remarkable addition to the record library.  Grady Harp, February 12ibrary.  Grady Harp, February 12",

         "Amazing album marred by a few cheesy tracks",
         "Seventh Wonder is a progressive power metal band hailing from Sweden. They’ve mostly flown under the radar until recently, when their lead singer Tommy Karevik joined the more popular American power metal outfit Kamelot. When Kamelot’s latest album Silverthorn was released in October of this year it received great critical acclaim, a lot of the praise focusing on the new singer. Some said that as good as Tommy Karevik performs with Kamelot on Silverthorn, Seventh Wonder is still a better band by comparison. That’s where my interest got piqued and what led me to look into Seventh Wonder’s latest album called The Great Escape.<br /><br />The first song on the album, Wizeman, blew me away. The guitarists provide a twisting and constant barrage of chugging riffage while Karevik somehow manages to sing catchy melodies over them, all the while showing off his impressive vocal range. Karevik immediately stands out from the rest of the band and though some of the instrumental breakdowns are impressive, the music just doesn’t carry much weight without him.<br /><br />For the most part, Karevik wisely avoids the lyrical cheese that is so prominent in this genre. But there are a few exceptions. Exceptions so devastating as to nearly destroy the entire package (but not quite).<br /><br />The second song, Alley Cat, comes in naturally and seems to keep the catchy progressiveness going. There’s nothing better than getting a new CD and finding that each song that plays is as good as or better than the last. And at first glance that is the case with this track…until you hear the lyrics. I’m a fan of power metal, I can handle some cheese, it just comes with the territory, but this goes beyond acceptable.<br /><br />This album suffers in a weird way. There are six stand alone tracks and one thirty minute epic track at the end. It feels like Karevik excised all the cheese from four of the tracks and then crammed it all into the other three. Having to skip songs on a CDas you listen is an album killer for me. My solution was to delete the three offenders (Alley Kat, Long Way Home, and Move on Through) and take in the album once more in its new abridged format.<br /><br />What a difference! The album went from fatally flawed to sheer brilliance. And it still clocks in at fifty-two minutes with three songs cut out. Unfortunately, not everyone picking this album up is going to be as brutally proactive as I in carving it up into the masterpiece it should have been, so that has to be weighed into the final verdict.<br /><br />The Great Escape is an exceptional album with a couple of glaring flaws that nearly destroy the whole thing. If you’re not a power metal fan to begin with, this isn’t going to win you over. However, if you are into this genre or can appreciate music for what it is within its own genre, then I highly recommend you give this album a listen. Just skip the audio abortions mentioned above and you’ll be left with candy and roses.",

         "The album is not as poor as some of the reviews would make it out to be.  Sure, the continual flow from \\\"Random Album Title\\\" is non-existent, but songs like \\\"Closer,\\\" \\\"Fn Pig,\\\" and the ingenious \\\"There Might Be Coffee\\\" are structured much in the same vein as the aforementioned album.  Of course, you've already heard \\\"Professional Griefers,\\\" which in my opinion is a great song, even with the addition of vocals.  Look...deadmau5 is obviously now more popular than ever and open to all sorts of scrutiny, but at the end of the day -- as a PRODUCER -- he is a master of his craft.  I do not, however, blame anyone who shall discontinue listening after \\\"October,\\\" simply because for me, the album stops there.  Many of the negative reviews make note of the oddly-placed Cypress Hill collaboration, \\\"Failbait,\\\" and I will admit, it is quite random.  I won't necessarily say that it is a bad song, but it serves as more of a throwaway bonus track than anything...as does \\\"Sleepless\\\" and \\\"Telemiscommunications.\\\"  Take the first ten tracks in as an album by itself and it'll become clear that this is indeed a deadmau5 record.  The buildups, transitions, and climaxes are all there, but temper your expectations.  This is nothing new or ground-breaking, yet serves as a more-than-satisfactory album in a world of increasingly-muddled and generic EDM...<br /><br />1) Superliminal:  4/5.  Nice intro/kick in the head.  Similar to \\\"FML.\\\"<br /><br />2) Channel 42: 4/5.  Solid material here.  Similar to \\\"Hi Friend\\\" and \\\"Moar Ghosts.\\\"<br /><br />3) The Veldt: 3.5/5.  Somewhat similar to \\\"I Remember,\\\" but not really.  Just a really chill tune.<br /><br />4) Fn Pig:  4.5/5.  Similar to \\\"Bad Selection,\\\" but the intro/various sound effects are quite reminiscent of the Megaman video game franchise...lol.<br /><br />5) Professional Griefers:  4.5/5.  Of course, you know this one.  Similar to \\\"Sofi Needs a Ladder.\\\"<br /><br />6) Maths:  3.5/5.  Catchy tune, but different.  Difficult to compare to previous work...actually somewhat similar to Justice's \\\"Phantom.\\\"<br /><br />7) There Might Be Coffee:  5/5.  Far and away, the best song on the album and a career top-10 landmark track.  Again, some nostalgic Megaman-ish sounds throughout...but damn, do they fit (seriously, Google Megaman if you are confused).  Similar to \\\"Aural Synapse\\\" and dare I say it, \\\"Strobe.\\\"  Yeah...I cannot stress this enough...it is THAT good.<br /><br />8) Take Care of the Proper Paperwork:  3/5.  Meh...this one isn't bad, but serves more as a transition between the two marvels that sandwich it.  Sounds like a collaboration that might have occurred between NIN and Prodigy...though an actual collaboration of that magnitude might make this very song shrivel up and die of humiliation.<br /><br />9) Closer:  5/5.  The other gem of the album.  What starts off like a \\\"red yellow green blue green\\\" SIMON sound effect (which might also be recognized from the \\\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\\" film), quickly sweeps you far away to a random Asian paradise...simply masterful.  There are certainly some elements uncannily reminiscent to \\\"Slip,\\\" yet the track climaxes nicely into something akin to \\\"Not Exactly.\\\"<br /><br />10) October: 4/5.  Good tune...but not necessarily great (just wished it climaxed into something greater).  However, it is the last TRUE piece of what deserves to constitute as one cohesive album.  Similar to \\\"HR 8938 Cephei.\\\"<br /><br />I won't even go into tracks 11-13 because as I have already mentioned, I don't quite consider them part of the album, but instead as simple \\\"bonus tracks.\\\"  Go into the album expecting some great building tracks that you've come to expect from \\\"The Mau5\\\" and disregard most of the negative feedback.  Give it a few spins and judge for yourself...work...actually somewhat similar to Justice's \\\"Phantom.\\\"<br /><br />7) There Might Be Coffee:  5/5.

The production quality is amazing and within each song you will hear the love and passion that the members of MaterDea put into their music.   You will hear a bit of Celtic influence, the amazing vocal talent of Simon, perfectly beaten drums, well executed violin work, enchanting bass lines, ghostly keyboards, WOWING guitar riffs by Marco that deliver a hard rock and metal edge, and lyrics that lift up the spirit of the \\\"Olde Religion.\\\"  The music on this album takes you back to times forgotten and bridges the past with the present by incorporating a powerful rock edge.  If this is to be the future of Pagan music, sign me up! Every song on the album is great, but stand out tracks are: Satyricon, The Green Man, Benandantes/Malandantes, Broomoon, Castle of Baux, The Little Diviner, and Between the Temple's Walls.  \\\"Lady of Inverness\\\" captures the spirit of the Mother Goddess!  Truly you will want every song on the album for each are great, and the songs fade in and out from one to another.

         "This is a fabulous album. I'm really blown away by Allen Stone. I caught a few seconds of his voice when he performed his song Unaware on Conan. I watch Conan with my mom every night it's on and almost never check out the musical guest, mostly because she would want to watch the whole performance even if she didn't like what she was hearing. I think I may have thought he was a comedian instead of a musical guest and that was why I checked it out to begin with. I figured I'd have a brief listen anyway and was surprised by what I heard, so I planned on listening to the rest of the performance later on. I listened to that performance of that song almost incessantly after I remembered to check it out a few days later. I never thought any song would top that live version of Unaware, but Allen proved me wrong. This man can sing. He can write a mean song, too. I found that out when I decided to check out more songs from him and delved deeper into it. I downloaded his Take One session and eventually decided I had to have this album, Last To Speak, as well as his self-titled album. I really love False Alarms, Figure It Out and Quit Callin. Breathe Anymore is so sad but it's a great song. I loved Reality, too--especially the beautiful lyrics in the chorus. I love them all. The title-track Last To Speak is such a powerful song lyrically. I was really surprised by it. This is a wonderful album and I would highly recommend it.",

I don't usually purchase whole albums anymore, but I liked what I heard so much, I decided to buy it. For those of you who want to know who they might sound like to give a good comparison, I'd say it's a mix between Flogging Molly, Jethro Tull and just ever so slightly Maroon5. Now, they sound VERY unique, and I only compare them to try and give a comparison. Worth a listen!!<br /><br />The song \\\"Young Wrath\\\" is my favorite on this album! I blast it in my car. :)",

         "With the passing of Dennis Flemion last July, this album and its companion (Count Yer Blessingz) became the final material from The Frogs' vast cannon. The band's previous album, 2001's Hopscotch Lollipop Sunday Surprise, saw the band utilizing higher production values (probably from their connections with high profile bands like Smashing Pumpkins) to craft more accessible songs that, while utilizing the band's trademark humor, was not drowned in it like the bands infamous &#34;made-up&#34; cassettes, It's Only Right and Natural, or My Daughter the Broad.<br /><br />Over a decade later, the band are back recording on their own. While this album (and for all purposes, statements made for this album also apply to Count Yer Blessingz) seem to blend the two identity of The Frogs. On one hand, the band's notorious twisted humor and willingness to break taboo are present; these two albums seem to be based around the loose concept of a man diagnosed with AIDS. Furthermore, while the instrumentation of HLSS mixed acoustic and electronic instruments with synthesized sounds to create a large sound space, these albums see the band returning to the instrumentation their most known for: gently strummed acoustic guitars and a tiny hint of keyboard splashed in the background, occasionally interrupted by a discordant guitar solo courtesy of Jimmy Flemion. In terms of vocals, Jimmy chants through songs in his usual &#34;minstrel&#34; voice while Dennis pulls out his famous &#34;funny&#34; voices.<br /><br />In closing, fans of The Frogs will find plenty within these albums to enjoy (including a cover of a Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers song) but someone who does not know much about The Frogs more be lured in more by their work that displays their more melodic/conventional side (the Starjob EP or the previously mentioned Hopscotch Lollipop Sunday Surprise) or the albums that that eschew all sense of standard songwriting convention and display the band's trademark insanity (It's Only Right and Natural, My Daughter the Broad, Bananimals, or any of the made up songs collections). In my opinion, this album stands somewhere in the middle with Racially Yours or the band's self-titled debut. Not quite perfect, but still worthy of a listen.<br /><br />It's sad to see an era end so suddenly with the death of Dennis Flemion, but we can only hope that we may finally get to hear some of the thousands of songs the band recorded and never released.",

The 12 inch disc of the v-disc were live broadcast through the armed forces radio recorde for the troop over seas who could not hear them. There were a lot of them but unfortunately the majority of the discs were destroyed from travel over seas from the bumpy rides when the planes went thru flac during the war. So a lot of the v-disc box sets you get are mostly the recordings from the bands with some of the original jam sessions from the big names like Benny Goodman and others. If you ever come acroos these box sets are hard to find anymore since they put them out for a short time and then discontinue them i suggest you get them and enjoy them.",

She has an astonishing richness in her voice & a truly straight-forward sincerity - especially for someone who was only 11 at the time of these recordings!<br /><br />In an age when singing often takes a backseat to studio gimmickry, Miss Scott not only sings directly from the heart without any tricks, but has a great ear for song selection (most of the tracks on this album are 50+ years old!).<br /><br />My personal favorites are 'I Got Rhythm', 'Shoe Fly Pie', 'Honeysuckle Rose', 'Have Yourself A Merry Christmas', and the show-stopping closer - 'Moon River'. But all the performances are tremendous!<br /><br />I'm looking forward to her follow-up CD!",

With bands like High on Fire, Orange Goblin, Dawnbringer, The Sword filling my MP3 player I am starting to see a pattern of down-tuned aural goodness developing. Bison BC has just been added to that list above thanks to their spectacular new release Lovelessness! This album has a ridiculous amount of momentum to it that allows the listener to become one with the music and almost drown in all of the sludgy goodness that emanates from the speakers. Bison BC have joined forces with mega-producer Sanford Parker and from the virtual tar pits have brought forth a monolith. Hyperbole aside this album does everything right and should put Bison BC on the map right next to the bands mentioned earlier including the (my opinion) overrated Mastodon. The intricate and delicate co-vocals allows for a different take on what happen to be some of the most heartfelt songs you will hear from a band that is this manly in both looks and sound. The musical collaboration allows for the music to penetrate deep into your soul and grab on and refuse to let go. After several listens to this album it becomes clear that the layers are strong and the use of the bass as a focal point just adds to that chugging locomotive of sound that they have created. If you love your metal from the depths of the basement then you will be appropriately impressed with what Bison BC have been able to accomplish with Lovelessness.",

         "The tracks were recorded on more than one Birdland date spanning the spring and summer of 1960, but the line-up is the same on most of the tracks. The only time the line-up varies is with pianists, and I do not know who played on which tracks. Personnel: Lee Morgan (trumpet), Wayne Shorter (tenor saxophone), Walter Davis, Jr. and Bobby Timmons (piano), Jymie Merritt (bass), and, of course,  Art Blakey (drums),<br /><br />Like all incarnations of the Jazz Messengers with Merritt in the line up, give him a careful listen if you are a bassist because he is one of the best Blakey had. But the focus on this album is Lee Morgan who is still in his early 20s and already a powerhouse player. Personally I think Lee is second only to Clifford Brown when it comes to trumpeters selected by Blakey (but when Blakey did have Clifford I do not believe his group was technically the \\\"Jazz Messengers\\\".)<br /><br />The tracks seem to have been carefully culled out from many recordings over the period covering the band's Birdland engagements. That is a plus in some ways because this album contains the absolute cream, and the music shows ... as does Morgan's and the rest of the ensemble's playing. Frankly, I prefer end to end recordings of performances that capture the good with the bad. I feel more like I am there, but I am not complaining.<br /><br />Since this album is focused on Lee Morgan, you may want to peel back a few years to 1958 and enjoy his playing when he was only 20 on this great album, which is also live at Birdland: [[ASIN:B001Q1PQQK Monday Nights at Birdland]].

Had no idea the genre of underground hip hop existed over there so this to me was a surprise. This includes artists like Luis Diaz Yall Zee(Intifada), Tek One, Siete Nueve, Konceptos, Ikol Santiago just to name a few.  Velcro's Manana album is a music experience in itself.

At the end of the 70s, as the first rap singles appeared in  the charts worldwide, everybody considered it an insignificant fad. Provocative speech-songs about  ghetto themes, more or less stolen music, that could not have any future. But it all turned out quite  differently.  For several decades, Hip Hop is a huge business for the music industry. Since \\\"Rappers Delight\\\" Hip  Hop is just re-invented several times. The Jazz-Hip Hop of the 90s has inspired the students, the liaison  with other popular styles were also very fruitful. But probably most important is the fact, that young  people around the world realized, that you can practice Hip Hop in almost any language. Even young  musicians, who have no money for their own instruments, can express themselves through Hip Hop.  While gangster Hip Hop in the U.S. was booming, the politically disillusioned youth in Latin America and  Africa discovered Hip Hop as a very effective means of expression to the ruling system. And in Europe,  Hip Hop is used as a voice for the immigrant youth, Algerians in France, Latinos in Spain, Turks in  Germany, in England Africans and in Sweden Arabs. With Hip Hop, anyone can provoke the hated  world of adults, while the Hip Hop perfectly binds together its subculture with its own breakdancing and  graffiti.  For decades Hip Hop was decried as the epitome of American cultural imperialism. But when this style  is practiced by migrants, living in Europe or in Africa, in Latin America or Asia, it is suddenly seen as  torch-bearer of cultural resistance. The only problem is, that most global-beat lovers respond almost  allergic to any form of Hip Hop and in all good faith, they are hardly prepared to deal intensively with  this expression of youth culture.  The music label LOLA'S WORLD RECORDS tries squaring the circle with the double compilation \\\"HIP  HOP WORLD\\\". These producers have set themselves the difficult task to bring the global Hip Hop  closer to the very skeptical World-Music audience. This compilation series will not bless convinced Hip  Hop fans with the latest hits from around the world. Hip Hop is presented here for people, who  previously thought, they would hate Hip Hop!

         "...the sea between brightness and Touche Amore has been parted.",
         "Touch Love represents one of the more interesting niches of recent modern hardcore. Wired for in-your-face, up close and personal live assaults, they've crafted a fiery brand of infectious punk, mixed with the captivating introspection of older screamo bands like Gospel, Orchid, and pg.99. Their debut album ...To The Beat of a Dead Horse was one that took the scene by storm and having every new-era fitted, mesh short wearing, pit bro adopting obscure band tees and memorizing, at length, the outro to `Honest Sleep'. Corny jokes aside, Touche Amore have built up a solid fan base since then and have also found a new label to call home in the process. Now firmly in the loving hands of Deathwish (Converge, The Hope Conspiracy, Ceremony), the Bay Area band readies themselves for their sophomore album Parting The Sea Between Brightness and Me.<br /><br />The hype surrounding this album cannot be ignored. Collapsing the Deathwish servers for several days when advanced orders for the album came online, it serves as a testament to the loyalty and downright rabid behavior of the fans that Touche Amore have cultivated. Literally champing at the bit, everyone has been wanting their grimy little fingers over Parting The Sea; and you know what? The hype is well deserved. Parting The Sea Between Brightness and Me is quite frankly the album that a band, with as much potential and hype as Touche Amore have, needs in order to become one of the premiere hardcore acts in the scene.<br /><br />Where some acts like to dress their albums down as pretty and presentable as possible, Parting The Sea comes at you straight up in its birthday suit. Stripped down entirely to the bare essentials, it's trimmed past the fat and bone all the way to the marrow. At barely twenty minutes in length and at thirteen songs there is very little for the imagination as each song on the album is a blazing comet that burns hot and bright for an extremely short length before dying out. While it's no Ampere or Jeromes Dream, songs like `Uppers/Downers' and `Pathfinder' cut past all the pretense of bridges, chorus and verses, essentially ignoring all basic song structure, in favor of near eighty second bursts of climatic energy.<br /><br />Although don't assume Parting The Sea to be some chaotically structured affair. The best songs on the album reach into the realms of post-rock with clean interludes and intros before starting the tempo up again. Songs like `~' (or simply `Tilde'), the piano ballad `Condolences', and `Amends' shine out from the rest of the album, bringing the true beauty of both the album and the band to bear. It's also in these instances where vocalist Jeremy Bolm comes into play. All hyperbole aside, when Bolm is in his element there is practically no equal. While not as introspective or personal as acts such as Envy or Heaven In Her Arms, Bolm has shown incredible aptitude in crafting clever one-liners since ...To The Beat and is only further improved upon on Parting The Sea.<br /><br />Yet while Touche Amore's sophomore album might seem nigh-immaculate, several smudge spots do appear. Produced by the legendary Ed Rose (producer of The Get Up Kids, Coalesce, and Reggie and the Full Effect), he does an outstanding job of making every note and every yell crystal clear and polished. However, this winds up homogenizing the sound of Parting The Sea and ultimately handicapping the entire listen in the process. Gone is the raw, instinctual emotion that was so passionately found on ...To The Beat of a Dead Horse and in its stead is a finely crafted work of production. Good for the sound, bad for the experience.<br /><br />Another problem that painfully makes itself known is the length of some of the tracks on Parting The Sea. True, while short structured songs are not a new phenomenon, some tracks like `The Great Repetition', `Crutch', and `Sesame' have difficulty taking off with the listener. Coupled with an insanely short length of just over a minute, it windsup cutting off the song and merging it with the next. This creates a vacuum within the album that makes the middle of Parting The Sea sound a bit difficult to differentiate.<br /><br />Although the shear level of growth that is witnessed on Parting The Sea is more than enough to make up for a more processed sound and somewhat mind numbing center section. Touche Amore have trimmed up more and have presented us thirteen tracks filled to the brim of angst, loss and death anxiety all within the manageable time frame of not even half an hour. Ending off the album with an apology on album closer `Amends' may have been a bit too self deprecating for the band, as the sea between brightness and Touche Amore has been parted. Through clever lyricism, passionately executed guitar play and frenetic drum work, Parting The Sea Between Brightness and Me stands as a band outdoing themselves and one upping the entire game in the process.xt.

         "I bought this album, Aura Surey, 'Many Roads Home', a half of a year ago and I love to listen to at least part of it every day. The music is rich and borrows from many types of musical forms, and I find it very enjoyable. For the songs, the words are very well articuated by the group's singer, Janice Torrez's beautiful and clear voice. Ron Warren , Aura Surey's flutist who composes most of the group's music and lyrics, is equally good in expressing his music in ways that are interesting , enjoyable, and never boring. Personally, I love the funky jazz sound that gets laced into some of the music. I can't get enough of two of Aura Surey's songs. The first is 'Imaginary Lines' which explores what is involved in life and relationship in a very deep and subtle way, but is translated it into simple words that can be widely understod by large amounts of people. it tells us to reach out and become friends with other people who are different, and erase the imaginary lines. Sundance (Dancing Every Day) is an enchanting song about what happened to American Indians, beginning with Christopher Columbus, and ends with a few words of encouragement for Indians in the future, if they stick together. I find it to be very accurate, since recently I have read extensively  about American Indian history plus brilliant essayists like Linda Hogan 'The Woman Who Watches Over the World' and 'Dwellings\\\". For me it's a part research and labor of love for my next book. Returning to Columbus, Janice Torrez is a member of the Taino tribe,once thought by scientists in the U.S. to be extinct. The Taino's are among tribes who actually encountered Coumbus on his first voyage to the Caribbean Sea, and in recent times they had hidden away in the hills of Puerto Rico.<br /><br />I hope you do not skip this group because they are American Indian. Many of their songs do have an American Indian flavor as it has been, but this band adds onto it beautifully and brilliantly. Also,for me, much tradtional American Indian music is fun and is presented in fun ways, but that's a different subject. I did not always think this way about traditional American Indian music. I had some good experiences that opened my mind.<br /><br />As an aside, I am writing a book, my second book. I am doing a great deal of research to make it a book people will want to read. My first book was published the Fall of 2010, but revised late in 2011. It is not completely comprehensive, and has not sold many copies at all. However, I have re-read it and am very proud of it. As for the book I am writngI especially want to find out more about treaties, and law, including American law as it has been applied to tribes, and I want to look at Indian Sources and the fight for their rights first.<br /><br />Returning to my first book, whoever reads my first book should not overlook my poetry, that takes up 16 pages of the book. It may be different from most modern poetry, but I think people who see it will most likely like it very much. My first book is called 'Rising with the Underclass and Poems\\\". I am not saying this for peronal financial gain. I like my book very much, and I am writng this review because, to me, Aura Surey is a terrific group that is being overlooked by most people. Although I do not have any of the musical gifts of Aura Surey, my book has some very original qualities and puts well known stories together very differently. I believe my prose may be controversial. However, I go beyound that, I have found significant great amount of rival U.S. history sources from many different people who have lived underneath what historians too think are the good people that allows me to take on established notions and associate things very differently. My book should be controversial, it sides with all the underdogs,but I do not allow the uderdogs to be straw men, and so you might find my book to be a great challenge. At least as important my poetry should be enjoyed by a large range of readers.  Poetryis a big house, and although there are some good poets, it is a house that has a great number of very different poets. Many poeple who have heard me read a couple of my poems applaud and  sometimes tell me personally they really like them. At least I believe my poetry it is a part of that big house, that you might possibly like among the many different kinds.is a big house, and although there are some good poets, it is a house that has a great number of very different poets.

         "To better understand life lived outside the law and steeped in seclusion, Steve Earle’s first-person account of a young, rural Tennessean descended from a family of moonshiners in the 1988 song “Copperhead Road” offers an authentic view of a potentially dangerous, certainly difficult multi-generational life path that is a small but noteworthy part of the definition of Americana.<br /><br />The song, a hybrid construction of county, rock, and Scottish folk genres, utilizes an instrument often associated with American bluegrass, the mandolin. After the notes open with the drone of bagpipes, perhaps signifying ethnic Highland roots of those in the composition’s storyline, the mandolin’s chords begin to punctuate the air, evoking an image of strings strummed from the proverbial screened porch of a rustic farmhouse near a dirt road on a hot, Sunday afternoon. Time in this timeless scene is kept dutifully by a solitary drumbeat.<br /><br />Launching into the tale with lyrics written in couplet form, Earle’s honey-coated, yet gritty vocals define the lineage of the song’s persona: “Well my name’s John Lee Pettimore / Same as my Daddy and his Daddy before.” From this point forward, the speaker explains that the grandfather mentioned would very rarely come around; when he did, it was for supplies required in the production of illegal whisky. After all, such work requires stealth to keep from being discovered by the IRS, or, in Earle’s diction, “the revenue man.” From there the song relates the process and risk involved in the creation of moonshine, the procurement of a sheriff’s used squad car converted into a fast way of transporting the illicit product, and the ultimate destruction of the whisky still once it is discovered by law enforcement.<br /><br />After this backstory has been told, the music dives into a more rollicking, guitar-infused, drum-pounding mode, perhaps to signal a shift from reminiscing about the family’s past and moving into a revelation of the speaker’s present.<br /><br />Reflecting on times current to that of the third-generation descendant now back home from his two-tour stint as a soldier in Vietnam, the family business of making moonshine is replaced with the growing of marijuana at this remote homestead on Copperhead Road. The speaker reveals that he discovered the demand for this product while serving overseas in Southeast Asia. The only thing that has changed in his eyes is that instead of distilling a product, he’s growing one.<br /><br />Given how the roots of smuggling moonshine on this part of the country’s back roads sparked the genesis of what is now known as NASCAR racing, “Copperhead Road” offers a primer on a way of life lived by some Americans over generations, and the evolving nature of that life. The song’s more matter-of-fact tone, both lyrically and musically, tells the story of a family’s way of making a living, albeit illegally. While some may blanch at the notion of putting up high on a pedestal a song with such content, it is nonetheless an accurate reflection about life for one segment of our populace.<br /><br />Support great songwriting: buy this song.",

After delivering huge but digestible slabs of twisted doom on 2000's \\\"Further\\\" and 2003's \\\"13\\\", Solace went through some unspecified difficulties (I heard that lead singer Jason just disappears for long periods of time) and kept pushing \\\"A.D.\\\"  Usually when this happens it is a recipe for disaster but this is the rare record, like Tool's Lateralus, that uses the silence that preceded it for creative catharsis.<br /><br />To be fair there wasn't total silence before A.D. as Solace put out and EP and a split.  But what we want from this band are albums.  This is one of few bands in metal that can deliver a spacey, brutal, layered, breathing album that can carry you from beginning to end.  \\\"A.D.\\\" makes Solace 3 for 3 on this front.  Front and center are the first three tracks, which are as much a statement of purpose as the first three tracks on Nevermind.  You listen to them back to back and get everything this band has to offer.  They're all great, but \\\"Six-Year Trainwreck\\\" (wait, wasn't it 7?), with its sludge-blue first four minutes and tribal dizzying three-minute finale, is the one that most sounds like a band transforming its insecurities into vengeance.<br /><br />Time will tell if it's Solace's best album but it's certainly its most inspiring.",

I'm saying this because, this record, entitled The Burial Tree (II), made by the Californians Ana Kefr, whose elements have different tastes of each other, mix a variety of styles. Death Metal is the main style but in between we caught several progressive passages and can also listen to some metalcore influences.  Like Opeth's Ghost Reveries in 2005, Persefone's Core in 2006, Primordial's To The Nameless Dead in 2007, Between the Buried and Me's Colors in 2008, Mastodon's Crack The Skye in 2009, Enslaved's Axioma Ethica Odini and Orphaned Land's The Never Ending Way of OrWarriOr of in 2010, The Burial Tree (II) has come to continued the work of the other albums i just mentioned that is to mark a new direction for heavy music. As you can see, it's been normal that as the years go by, several albums appear to change, piece by piece, the rules of the game and to show the world that is still possible to innovate and maintain a great quality.  As i mentioned at the beginning of this analysis, this item is not for the weak though it has a lot to please every metalhead, even Metalcore fans, listen to \\\"Parasites\\\" and also \\\"In the House of Distorted Mirrors\\\" for example, you may have a surprise. Even the Grindcore is present in the short \\\"Jeremiad.\\\" The Death Metal vocals are quite amazing, but the clean vocals are simply divine, in fact, lead singer Rhiis D. Lopez does an amazing job here, the changes he made between clean and guttural voice and even the various screams that he reaches will please all kinds of extreme music fan.  Ana Kefr's music can bring us very emotional experiences, at times it seems we are in the middle of the apocalypse alongside Meshuggah (listen to \\\"The Circus Zephirus\\\") and we can also listen to something that came from a third dimension through Unexpect (\\\"Thaumatrope\\\").  To conclude, this album is all forthose that like albums full with small details and you'll need a long time to the notice all of them. No doubt that is worthy the head several top's of the year, but since Ana Kefr it's still one of the many bands whose recognition is still null, The Burial Tree (II) will become one of the many lost jewels that will be forgotten by the majority of society. For those who want to hear something complex, fresh and impossible to categorize this album is perfect.",

         "The beloved duo's final release.  I found this the most different out of all of their released music.<br /><br />Oddly, the lyrics are nowhere near the highly optimistic and upbeat variety shown on their two albums.  The EP talks about breakups, grey days, people not meant being for each other, and well, being 'stranded on an island alone', though metaphorically perhaps.  Definitely not any imagery I expected with my favorite happy-go-lucky duo.  To be fair, it's not all downer but still not an EP one would expect from Junior Senior.  The Headphone Song and I Can't Rap manage to redeem some vibrancy in their lyrical tone.<br /><br />Though the lyrics are bittersweet, the music is among the most polished of their work, but is at the same time not quite in the same place as their albums, musically. One can get a taste of where Junior Senior may have headed had they stayed together.  This EP features I believe their first (and only?) song in the minor key as well as (more surprisingly) chromaticism.  Also, prepare yourself for large amounts of cowbell.  This EP feels like a logical progression from Hey hey my my yo yo, musically.  It doesn't feature as many background vocals, but Jeppe &#34;Senior&#34; Laursen sweet voice is heard much more here.  Together for one last dance and the headphone song (the ending is exquisite) are among my favorites from this EP.<br /><br />The album cover to Say Hello, Wave Goodbye features the duo with their backs to us, walking away.  With songs like Together For One Last Dance and U and Me, this was perhaps intended to be their final release.  For any Junior Senior fan, I would recommend them to pick this up (they only released so many songs, why not hear them all?).  For those who aren't quite that into them yet however, I would URGE you to pick up either of their studio albums; I would highly recommend their second, Hey Hey My My Yo Yo, a phenomenal album in all regards, one of my all-time favorites, though the first is fantastic aswell.<br /><br />This is a melancholic release by Junior Senior (I know, an oxymoron).  The way they went out like this (or at all) makes me pretty sad.  If anyone at all knows a translation to the final track here, Anja Anderson, I beg you, PLEASE contact me.<br /><br />Junior Senior's breakup is one of the greatest travesties of music in the past ten years.  I wish more than anything for them to get back together and make more wonderful music.  Until then, we have their delightful music to last us a lifetime.",

         "I discovered Steve Booke's work a few years ago on YouTube and immediately bought his album `Devotion: Music Inspired by The Passion of The Christ'. The haunting, Middle Eastern-like sound of Booke's guitar became my soundtrack for a large part of 2009.  Booke's new album, `The First Principal of Matter' is a change from previous work, with a more electronic sound on top of his trademark guitar. After `Devotion' and the subsequent albums, it's great to see an artist who is not afraid to take risks and move into different directions.<br /><br />TSBT overall has a distinctively spacey, futuristic sound similar to William Orb's - in particular, tracks like `The First Principal of Matter' and `Winds of Mars'.  \\\"Palmiers Au Soleil'\\\" and \\\"Pool of Life\\\" have a very cinematic quality and if  - in a parallel universe - Blade Runner was ever remade, these tracks would make a perfect  soundtrack for it.<br /><br />I can't deny that my favourite track is perhaps the one that most closely resembles the sound from `Devotion' - `Palace of Ishtar' grabs you with an infectious beat and a Middle Eastern feel; but unlike the `Devotion' album, this time the upbeat tempo evokes dancing around a fire at your local beduoin camp rather than, well, the Messiah's last few hours on earth.<br /><br />It's a shame that things always need to be labelled to be marketed, because saying that TSBT belongs to the `Electronic' genre is very reductive - people immediately think of `music made with computers' - a definition that puts the creations of a 13-year old kid experimenting with Garage Band in the same category as the work of Brian Eno. I first heard Steve Booke's music through an improvised acoustic guitar performance; it wasn't professionally recorded and had the added `effect' of YouTube's own file compression. But what had reached me then was still music with soul.<br /><br />It is notoriously difficult to describe music if you are not a musician; all you can do is to compare music to other music. I don't even know if Booke is a fan of William Orb, or if the `Blade Runner' soundtrack by Vangelis is part of his iTunes library. But this is the sound that springs to mind as I listen to TSBT; however, there is a lot more that I just can't articulate. So...all I can say is: download this album and then make your own mind up.music.

         "Sylvan's latest album consists of 5 \\\"chapters\\\" (depending on the version of the album you have, they may or may not be broken down into shorter tracks); each of these chapters is about 15 to 20 minutes long. The music is fairly mellow, with a focus on atmosphere and emotion.<br /><br />In the past I've found this band to be a bit hit and miss. Their early albums have a few standout tracks and a few clunkers; they finally got it all together on the brilliant Posthumous Silence and maintained a fairly high level of quality on Presets, but their album before this one, Force of Gravity, was quite a disappointment to me.<br /><br />The musicianship is solid, led by Volker Sohl's keyboards. After listening to Force of Gravity, I didn't think Jan Petersen was the right guitarist for the band, but he proves me wrong this time out with some beautiful and expressive playing. Marco Gluhmann's vocals are expressive and haunting, without the screaming-style vocals that appeared on their previous outing, and the rhythm section is solid.<br /><br />The highs on this album are very high, with some fantastic passages which grab the listener. However, there are also a lot of fairly bland sections on the album, and I wonder if some of the pieces weren't extended purely for the sake of making the album longer. I also think there isn't really enough variety for an album of this length - I find I can't listen to all 5 chapters back to back. I'll give the album 4 stars because of its strengths, but that's probably being generous.",

         "Singin' the small town blues that major labels lie about...",
         "Lucas Johnson plays acoustic guitar and sings on the album, with a few tracks highlighting other talents and friends. It has a morose, blues sound to it, with the edge of someone who grew up falling asleep to grunge rock. Some people may not like the effects on the voice, and some of the compression of a low-budget produced album comes through on the cymbals of the first track, but for an album made with a few friends, the guitar playing and lyrics stand out enough to keep you driving onward to each next track.  Alongside creative lyrical witticisms like \\\"the only soul you bear / is through the hole in your socks,\\\" the album pushes and pulls the listener in several directions, all of which contribute to that 'all mixed up inside' feeling that you feel Lucas had to be going for.<br /><br />\\\"Love\\\" is an album written by a United States Army veteran, who is now back home raising a family - and the album doesn't shy away from that. Hey Mother is one of my most favorite tracks on the album, because it absolutely reflects the attitude I've heard from dozens of veterans: I appreciate your concern, but I want you to trust me: I'm going to get through this. \\\"This,\\\" in this case, is the one noun that changes depending on the person, but a lot of times it may have to do with their reintroduction to \\\"normal life\\\" - life outside of a warzone. It may have to do with a traditional young man pushing back, ever so slightly, on their parents who might be concerned that they're getting married too soon. It might have to do with a person dealing with a break up or another mess in their personal life - but he has confidence that things will come out all right.<br /><br />I grew up in the same small town as Lucas, back in Corry, PA.  A local favorite, when Lucas is seen in a pub playing with a band, is often White Trash as Ever. Although he plays it with a bit of reluctance, there is no denying the guitar comes alive in this deeply personal song. \\\"Post traumatic slash bi-polar / is most of what I am / everything I've built up / just like castles in the sand.\\\" Christian overtones come through on the album, but they're still the feelings of a lost man. Confused, wondering where he stands between agnostic and angry, but finding comfort in his religion at times when almost nothing else will soothe his soul. The catchy strumming makes you want to listen to the album over and over, and the way Lucas lays it all out on the table makes this one of the most raw albums I've ever heard. I've had the limited run CD for a while, and encourage everyone to buy this now that it is on Amazon.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to hear what someone is genuinely thinking, not what their producer wants them to think, not what their friends want them to say, but what is really running through the mind of one man, who doesn't want to cut you to the core, but doesn't have much control over that once you listen to the album.verything I've built up / just like castles in the sand.\\\" Christian overtones come through on the album, but they're still the feelings of a lost man.

         "If the whole Clockwork Angels album is as good as BU2B, we are in for some true epicness come May 29th.  I purchased both this song and Caravan when they came out, but this is only a review of BU2B, which I think is the better of the two.<br /><br />As many people have already said, it is heavier then most of their stuff.  That can be good or bad depending on your tastes.  Personally, I think it's a good thing.  I like it when musicians change things up and try something new, it doesn't always work, but here it did!  The lyrics, while not the best of Rush, are certainly powerful and still great.  I will say I'm a tad biased since I've been a Rush fan for awhile, (though, not long enough since most Rush fans have been fans since before I was even born) but my mom is not a Rush fan, and when she heard this song on the radio, she really liked it too.  So, it seems to be likeable even to non-Rush fans as well, which is a good sign.  Also, when I went to their Time Machine tour in Pittsburgh (almost two years ago...it's been too long) this was probably my favorite song that they did live, even though it's not my favorite Rush song of all time!  I'm not sure how that works exactly, but it's true.  Maybe because it is such a powerful song.<br /><br />What makes a good or bad song/album/musician(s) differs for everyone because we all have different tastes. I'm more into lyrics myself, so it's the words in the song that make or break the song for me.  For others, it's the instrumentals that they are more into.  But, either way, I think everyone will be happy with this.  As usual, Rush brings great lyrics and a great tune.  I think that's why Rush is so good, some bands have great tunes, but lousy lyrics, while others have lousy tunes but great lyrics.  Rush can consistently be great at both (with a few exceptions, of course) There are some Rush songs (more than a few, actually) that I would only recommend to people who already are into the band a little bit, but I would recommend this to anyone even if they've never heard of Rush.",

         "This is Broken Harbour at the top of his craft, at his most intense and colossal!!!",
         "Canadian drone sculptor Blake Gibson known as Broken Harbour, based in Edmonton, strikes once again!!! After successful, self-released \\\"Gramophone Transmissions\\\" album he returns with his third full length work, entitled \\\"The Geometry Of Shadows\\\". This time released during November 2012 under the wings of Relaxed Machinery. The first impression is again very strong, just like with \\\"Gramophone Transmissions\\\" (thanks to the stunning cover images by Polish photo wizard Michal Karcz). For \\\"The Geometry Of Shadows\\\" digipak packaging Blake has teamed with another highly applauded visual designer, Kati Astraeir from Tucson, Arizona. There is no way to go wrong with having giants like these two on your side!!! Okay, let's explore now the interactions with the sonic part. \\\"The Geometry Of Shadows\\\" is comprised of 5 longer pieces, all clocking between 11 and 14 and half minutes. As mentioned by its protagonist, the original material for the album was recorded in late 2009, but later, during 2012, was completely reworked to nowadays shape. The album unveils sharply with abysmally freezing and static drones of \\\"Superluminal\\\", wrapped by icy wind, slowly expanding and diving to the most shadowy realms. A truly mind-bending, mammoth drone odyssey!!! The title composition, \\\"The Geometry Of Shadows\\\", moves towards more minimal, less massive structure with circling mechanical noises and eerie breaths, assorted distant rumbles and dissonances, all hazed by pervaded glitches. \\\"Between The Darkness And The Light\\\" returns immediately into heavier drone territories, sounding the deep, surrounded by high-pitched tinkles, squeaks, swirls and noises. Another mind-blowing sonic adventure, which during the second half gently cascades into circling and immense celestial and cinematic panoramas. Not only a precisely fitting track title, but also a pure sonic bliss by Broken Harbour!!! And it's just amazing how it works together with Kati Astraeir's cover image!!! But the magic continues with \\\"Luminosity\\\". I remember surveying this track for the first time while uploading some of my pictures taken in Kr&aacute;snohorsk&aacute; Cave and it left me immediately breathless!!! No matter if entitled \\\"Luminosity\\\", Broken Harbour's drone virtuosity was stunningly interplaying with these graciously monumental sceneries and quickly transported me back to these fascinating underground domains. Again flavored here and there by high-pitched infusions. Must be the \\\"Luminosity\\\" that bridges the past and present. What a journey!!! This is Broken Harbour at the top of his craft, at his most intense and colossal!!! The closing composition, \\\"Ansible\\\", merges deep low drones with hummed cybernetic fragments, expanding, flowing and ebbing. It provides a very strong finale of this spectacular listening experience. Even if drone based, still richly illuminating, but always powerfully complex and deeply immersing. Broken Harbour is undoubtedly another enormously vital addition to already impressive Canadian ambient scene, mostly represented by artists from Toronto, London and Vancouver areas. Great stuff, you can be really proud of it, Blake!!! And keep on droning!!! I would like to mention also Peter James and Steve Brand from Relaxed Machinery gang, who are credited for mastering and design. Last but not least, I really hope more artists from Relaxed Machinery roster will consider this way in the future, when it goes to packaging choices. Digipak, CD wallet or standard jewel case packaging looks more challenging!!!<br /><br />Richard G&uuml;rtler (Dec 26, 2012, Bratislava, Slovakia)uminosity\\\".

Yes we loved the old style but I welcome his new style with open arms. He still has his old flare in all his songs that when you hear for the first time without seeing the artist name and can say that it's Owl City.<br /><br />Both \\\"Shooting Star\\\" and \\\"Silhouette\\\" are my favorites displaying that you can shine and do your best attitude in \\\"Shooting Star\\\" while the later being his slowest song that displays a \\\"moving on with life\\\" attitude with painful memories, which I connected with and I bet everyone else can too.<br /><br />Not everyone enjoys change, but I respect and accept his new turn in music and lyrics and can't wait for more in the future, keep it up Adam.",

         "There's a video of Jack Nicholson walking by a group of paparazzi outside of a restaurant. He's the image of cool swagger, the alpha, the star. He's talking through his smile though, telling the photographers that he's going to take matters into his own hands if they take a picture of his kid.   This album has that vibe. A skilled rapper operating with polish and sophistication willing to do what it takes to make his point. Smooth, sultry beats back up powerful rhymes. The combination suggests a predator at his ease. He knows he's at the top. The skill of this album suggests that he'll be there for awhile.",

         "The \\\"Hopeful. Romantic\\\" CD is an incredibly good work (see my review here: [[ASIN:B002FAMWZY Hopeful. Romantic]]), this is one of the many very beautiful songs from the CD.  It often brings tears to my eyes when I listen.  The arrangement is wonderfully effective, nice little piano accents and haunting guitar strings.  Very nicely produced with a great acoustic reverb flavor and sense of space.  It all makes for a very intimate sound.  And that's good, because this is a very intimate song.  It's one of those songs that provokes emotions based on empathy with the artist/songwriter as you listen and your own life experiences mix in with it all.  I also very much like the slow, intimate pacing of the song.  It's in no hurry which (to me) seems to recreate the feel of the moment when these thoughts and emotions produced this nice bit of art.  If you've ever sat quietly reflecting on a broken relationship in the softness of a late night, you know what I mean.<br /><br />Renee Stahl has a strong and beautiful voice and uses it to great effect in all her work.  It's seductive and stays with you.  If I am playing a mix, her songs always catch my ear and draw my attention.  Let's hope we hear a lot more from her!",

         "To compensate for their minimal exposure on major labels since the Masur era ended, the NY Phil. has been hugely proactive in releasing Alan Gilbert's concerts on their house label. Every one of them seems to be available as MP3s, and one must admire the sound, which is very fine, all but miraculous considering the acoustic deficits of Avery Fisher Hall. How can it sound so ugly in real life and so lovely through a microphone? Here from June 2010 is #28 of thirty download concerts to celebrate Gilbert's first year as Music Director. The program spans three centuries, from the Mozart Sym. 25, the little G minor, to Wagner's Siegfried Idyll, and finally HK Gruber's \\\"Aerial,\\\" a fanciful two-movement trumpet concerto that the Times critic described as a \\\"global party piece.\\\"<br /><br />to begin, \\\"Siegfried idyll,\\\" done in the full orchestral version, is paced with a nice flow, but there's no tension or contrast. Gilbert approaches the work as a pleasant lullaby, so as not to wake baby Siegfried. What's memorable is the excellent ensemble and sensitive solo work from the Philharmonic. A conductor has to have more to say in the Prelude and Liebestod from Tristan und Isolde. Gilbert doesn't really reach; he delivers a reading that is technically accomplished but bland and reserved, the last thing one wants from Tristan.  the Mozart is done in a style familiar from the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields: correct, enthusiastic, but always in god taste. That's not harsh criticism; I'd be happy to encounter this performance at a subscription concert, and besides, how many mainstream conductors find much personal meaning in Mozart anymore? His music is played to please an audience with its familiarity.<br /><br />Which leaves the Gruber concerto, featuring the charismatic trumpeter Hakan Hardenberger. Gruber is best known for his strange, entertaining \\\"Frankenstein!!\\\" that piece harked back to the antics of Spike Jones fifty years ago. Here Gruber asks the soloist to play three instruments, a normal trumpet, a high-flying piccolo trumpet (revived by modern virtuosos from its heyday in the Baroque), and a cow horn, of all things, which sounds warm and hollow. The idiom of the piece is mostly breezy and jazzy, and like like most of Gruber's music, its chief aim is to offer whimsical diversion. The second movement, we are told, was inspired by an image in the composer's head of a depopulated Earth as viewed from space, with the planet bearing a sign reading, \\\"Gone Dancing.\\\"  Other than Oliver Knussen and Paul Schoenfield, there aren't many playful composers around, so all of this is welcome. But too much of the second movement sounds like aimless noodling; I preferred the eerie atmosphere of the opening bars, which opens with the low buzzing of the cow horn. I'm sure the audience had fun, but was it necessary to bring in Hardenberger  when the Philharmonic has always had top-notch trumpet players, the best in the business?e instruments, a normal trumpet, a high-flying piccolo trumpet (revived by modern virtuosos from its heyday in the Baroque), and a cow horn, of all things, which sounds warm and hollow.

I just don't know how I didn't find it sooner.<br />From the deliberate pacing of the album's \\\"Introduction\\\" into the song \\\"Hail Bop\\\", ridiculously catchy vocal harmonies weave with tremolo soaked guitars and driving percussion to make for one of the most infectious albums of the year!!!<br />The following track \\\"Default\\\" begins with a schizoid vocal loop over a beat that will have you begging for it to get out of your head (albeit, in a very good way) before launching into one of the most simplistic, but great, guitar riffs of this year.<br />As for the aforementioned vocal harmonies, the chorus of \\\"Love's Dart\\\" has one that could make James Mercer wish he'd included it on this year's The Shins album.<br />All of that said, this isn't a straight electro-indie-pop affair. On the contrary, it is an odd little beast that makes you roll with and embrace whatever hairpin turns it wants to take at a split-second's notice (e.g. \\\"Skies Over Cairo\\\"). Now that I think about it, no genre really describes this album accurately.<br />Infectious, challenging and, for me anyways, a great new discovery to end what has already been a great year for music!!!!",

         "This is a killer record, period. I found about it on the [...] website, and purchased it from the MelodicRock Records online store. Got the CD. The edition, artwork, and stuff is very good, with a nicely designed, thick booklet. Coming from a small, independent, and new label, that's impressive. But even more impressive is what's on the CD. The music is a treat for any fan of melodic hard rock. It does fall on the more commercial side of the rock divide, but this doesn't detract from its quality a bit. While the songs are generally very catchy and the CD is plentiful of hooks, the musicianship is first class. Its catchy without being superficial or light. It feels like the best of the 70's and 80's without sounding dated or repetitive. The songwriting is pretty strong. Production feels like a million bucks, despite the fact that the budget was surely short. Hard rock lovers will find strong guitar riffing and some tasty shredding (yes, I meant that), with masterful keyboard playing accompanying. As a matter of fact, the whole band sounds so tight and professional. This is one of my highlights of the year, and I look forward to a second album by Degreed. A truly wonderful discovery, it is highly recommended.",

         "Track 1 End In View by Ov Hollowness. Cool plodding solemn opening instrumental leading to brief mellow old lady metal vocal then more excellent band play. Song expands at around 5 minutes band steps it up a notch and rocks. Vocal strengthens, for me this song is about the music, band is solid, if this is ambient metal I like it.<br /><br />Omega Vibration by Our Last Day On Earth. Another mood making slow throbbing song with minor vocal enhancements. Some choral in the background, music is strong and complex enough to stay with. Like it.<br /><br />Hymne II- Neige Noire by Neige et Noirceur. myspace says Ambient/Black Metal I would add Experimental. ms also says \\\"The music wants to be a dark musical interpretation of long evening winters. The gloomy and distressing mood masks a cold stormy black metal\\\". Pretty intense 9 minutes of keyboards, metal vocals and driving noise. Not an everyday song nevertheless when the mood takes you this song will help you get there. Like it.<br /><br />Epikrisis V- Rorschach Inkblot by Epitimia. Russia based Black Metal/Experimental band give us whispering metal vocal over more ambient continuous metal rooted backing track. More vocal than earlier tracks apparently in Russian (or German?) all spoken not adding much to the track that still manages some personality and little gems of life.<br /><br />We Are Nothing by The Foetal Mind. Weird myspace biography page, these guys may now be called TFM. Nevertheless cool instrumental Black Metal track. Strong consistent theme throughout. Like it.<br /><br />Track 6 Crows by Stroszek. Confident semi Black Metal song that goes further and expands the genre. Same building ambient musical sound, very intimate vocal more complex and fun. Enjoyed all 5 and half minutes.<br /><br />Mind-bending Chemicals by Netra. Black Metal/Trip Hop French band. Slow somber music leading to very annoying spoken audio samples from the 60's warning about hallucinogenic drugs returning to mild musical sometimes sound affected track.<br /><br />Faceless Moments by Ekove Efrits. Iranian Black Metal one man band now making Depressive Black Metal music according to his own record label. Actually very active track, plenty going on w/some lighter moments, mostly somber musical backing with new noises and cruel vocal. Keeps you listening although may only be one time. Not bad, at least he's trying-for nearly 7 minutes.<br /><br />...With Each Prevailing Wind by Old Forgotten Lands. Piano gently played for 9 minutes, someone speaks around 6 - brutal.<br /><br />In Exile by Funeral Fornication. Best band name, scary very mellow opening leading to old lady metal vocal over droning ambient backing track very low opening volume output (at least on WMP) you should make it louder although you may not want to, at 4 and half minutes new vocal over the same backing track starts. Not enough to save it you may love all 7 minutes.<br /><br />Filth Of Mankind by Silent Path. Best song name. Same guy as Ekove Efrits above more Atmospheric than Black Metal, much louder (in WMP) than previous track kinda messy but more fun, nearly 7 minutes mostly instrumental, worth at least one listen.<br /><br />Great mix of Black Metal and it's relatives. Plenty I enjoyed, you know if you like it. If you've never heard Black Metal try it, less vocal more about the music. Not bad, some long tracks you need to be in the mood. Download while it's free.",

After five or six spins through this CD, I also have to admit that I'm hooked. This is some of the gentlest, most refreshing vocal music I've ever heard. Mirabai Ceiba consists of Angelika Baumbach, an American-born singer/songwriter who also performs on piano, harp, harmonium, and singing bowls, and East German-born Markus Sieber who composed most of the music, sings, and plays guitars. They are backed by an impressive list of musicians who play drums and percussion, acoustic and electric strings, trumpet, keyboards, electric guitar, ukulele, and tambour. The lyrics for most of the ten songs are based on poetry by Rumi and Khalil Gibran and are sung in English and Spanish. Baumbach's voice is light and airy yet deeply passionate, giving the songs warmth as well as substance. Sieber's voice carries feelings of great sensitivity and tenderness. A duo in life as well as in their music, everything about their music rings true - especially the emotions conveyed. Despite the number of musicians involved, the production is subtle and uncluttered, focusing on the beauty of the voices and the words. From the stunning cover artwork to the last note of the music, this album is just about perfect!<br /><br />\\\"Between the Shores of Your Souls\\\" begins the album and sets the mood with both voices, guitar, muted trumpet, and keyboard washes. It only took about ten seconds into this song for me to realize I was listening to something really special. \\\"Ocean of My Dreams,\\\" \\\"Become My Life,\\\" and \\\"Inside the Majesty\\\" are based on poems by Rumi, expressing deep love of a more spiritual nature. Most of the accompaniment is acoustic guitar, but there are subtle strings and atmospheric keyboard that underscore the simplicity of the music and the words. \\\"La Luna\\\" is a favorite. The lyrics for this song come from an ancient Zen poem and are sung in Spanish by Angelika with a compelling mix of childlike wonder and earthy passion - this one gets me every time! \\\"Breeze At Dawn\\\" is gently haunting, promising secrets if you don't go back to sleep. The last track, \\\"Burn of the Heart,\\\" smolders passionately - simply and directly - with more instrumentation than most of the songs, trailing off at the end and closing with a sigh.<br /><br />This is good stuff, and I can guarantee I'll be checking out more of Mirabai Ceiba's previous releases! \\\"Between the Shores of Our Souls\\\" is certain to be one of my favorites for the year!  Very highly recommended!sung in Spanish by Angelika with a compelling mix of childlike wonder and earthy passion - this one gets me every time! \\\"Breeze At Dawn\\\" is gently haunting, promising secrets if you don't go back to sleep.

         "National instrument of Sweden nyckelharpa(key fiddle).Great Vasen band . Polska dance music, more modern plus traditional",
         "Vasen is my favorite band in the world...period! The centerpiece is Olov Johansson world nyckelharpa champion, plus a super world class viola player Mikael Martin, and an excellent guitar player. Olov had the great fortune at a young age in Sweden to be tutored by a nyckelharpa Grandmaster.<br /><br />The nyckelharpa is a very old style, extremely difficult instrument to master. You key the many wooden pegs into the regular strings plus the many drone strings ( much more than a twelve string guitar), while you bow the strings with a bow. Very difficult to do both well at the same time and takes decades of practice. I know, as I have a nyckelharpa and can only play 3 songs, none very well. Both hands with fingers flying, hands and wrist just so, trying to keep in sync and using the correct pressure and technique with the bow. You get the picture...more difficult than playing the Violin.<br /><br />There are only a handful of Grandmaster world champion nyckelharpa players and Olov Johansson is one.<br /><br />I met the great Vasen band playing in Epcot at Walt Disney in Orlando Fl and shook hands with the players. Super great music and a fantastic meeting. I have almost all their albums on CD.<br /><br />I downloaded Vasen Street on my much more portable and longer battery lasting MP3 player. Absolutely no problem with the MP3 download and the syncing. The audio was great. The instrumental songs are rich with the complex full body, in depth Nyckelharpa as the lead instrument. This gives the songs an extreme range of notes and octaves. Sounds that on a regular violin or fiddle are impossible to produce. Rich and powerful.<br /><br />Great dancing Polska, plus some more modern songs and a lot of the more traditional Swedish nyckelharpa music. A well blended sampling allowing the listener to sit back, close his/her eyes and experience northern Scandinavian old time ( way,way before radio and TV)music that they used to play around the campfire and still do at competitions in Sweden. A few of the songs makes me think of the Viking age and others resemble a complex Irish jig or Celtic music.<br /><br />The old time nyckelharpa players were very superstitious and took great pride playing at weddings etc. and trying to be the best players. Some kept fingernail clippings of past great players in little sacks stored inside the instrument to give them luck and instrumental power.<br /><br />The listener will be blessed with great music  as the vast majority have never even heard a nyckelharpa. Here is Vasen a band with a Grandmaster playing the lead instrument, INMO one of the world's best Viola players,and a great guitar player that mesh extremely well in their playing. Vasen street is a great album and MP3 download and Vasen INMO the greatest band in the world! 5 stars plusin Sweden.

         "\"The Classic Crime\" lead Singer and his Wife",
         "Started making an EP after she became pregnant. Their way of paying for the next stage of life? Making an EP that she has been bugging him to make.<br /><br />I am a fan of Matt MacDonald. When I first heard him sing in the band \\\"The Classic Crime\\\" I was hooked. The thing about Matt MacDonald and his lyrics are something that I have seen no other band perform quite as well. It is that one enjoys listening to the music because it is good and listens to it over and over, but then something amazing happens--you realize how deep the song is; I call it \\\"The second awakening\\\" when listening to his albums. Trust me, listen and you will have the same experience about a month later after listening to the songs.<br /><br />His wife sounds amazing in this EP. The harmony is great, the music is unique and everyone will ask who you are playing because the music captures your attention. I want to support this band and I cannot wait to see the two in concert. I hear the emotional connection over the CD, how much more will I hear it when the two are together live singing? I wonder just what these two are capable of. Buy this EP, buy it now.<br /><br />Travis",

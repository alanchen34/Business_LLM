         "Note: Amazon first made Series 3&4 available via streaming (free for Prime members) several months ago, and another fan of the series made it known to me that Series One and Two are now available via streaming (free for Prime members).<br /><br />Kevin Whately, the consummate actor who portrayed Chief Inspector Morse's (John Thaw) long-suffering Detective Sergeant Lewis on \\\"Inspector Morse\\\", is now Detective Inspector Lewis in \\\"Inspector Lewis\\\", a high quality investigative drama set in the academic town of Oxford, England.<br /><br />Having watched all of the Inspector Morse episodes, I can see the evolution of Lewis' character (brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Whately) from a diligent albeit lowly sergeant under the guidance of the amazing Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) to a confident, outspoken, yet still down to earth DI who now has his own underling in the form of the intellectual, gifted DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox).<br /><br />Season 2 of Inspector Lewis is quite an engaging series, containing many interesting episodes featuring DI Lewis (Kevin Whately) and DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox). Part of what makes Insp. Lewis a charming series for me is the banter between Lewis and the more cerebral, Cambridge-educated (in theology), Hathaway. There's lots to satisfy the discerning viewer in Season 2 - picturesque Oxford, literary references, and riveting plots, not to mention the excellent ensemble cast.<br />Season 2 contains the following episodes:<br /><br />And The Moonbeams Kiss the Sea - One of my favorites of all the Lewis episodes. This is not only well-written, but is also atmospheric. Lewis and Hathaway try to discover the link between two murders. One is of a maintenance worker at Oxford's Bodleain Library, and the other is of a popular art student. As they dig deeper, they find out that the two deaths are related to some high level forgery involving works of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Oxford dons addicted to gambling.<br /><br />Music to Die For - Whilst investigating the murder of an elderly gay lecturer, Lewis finds connections to the world of underground amateur boxing, the East German Secret Police (Stasi), and even Lewis' old mentor Morse. Poor Lewis gets sort of entangled with a beautiful German, but are her motives purely romantic?<br /><br />Life Born of Fire - The death of a gay student, gay bashing, and college politics get to Hathaway since the dead student also happened to be Hathaway's friend and former classmate. There are some truly strange twists in this one.<br /><br />The Great and the Good - An intriguing episode. A young girl Beatrice is found drugged and a victim of rape, and evidence points to a certain Oswald Cooper, who himself ends up garrotted and castrated. The question is: who is the killer and what is the motive?<br /><br />Allegory of Love - A mysterious young woman is found killed, the weapon being an antique Persian mirror. This resembles a scene found in a historical novel written by up and coming Oxford author, Dorian Crane. Then another young woman is threatened, leading Lewis and Hathaway on a desperate search for the truth.<br /><br />The Quality of Mercy - death and Shakespeare meet when the actor playing the role of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice is found murdered. When another murder occurs, Lewis and Hathaway find their hands full as the list of suspects gets longer.<br /><br />The Point of Vanishing - Curious case of a man killed in his own bathtub.<br /><br />I'd recommend the Inspector Lewis series to any fan of quality British crime procedurals.ilst investigating the murder of an elderly gay lecturer, Lewis finds connections to the world of underground amateur boxing, the East German Secret Police (Stasi), and even Lewis' old mentor Morse.

I love the combat options and the overall difficulty. Some of the scenes in this are breathtaking and show just how far video games have come. HOWEVER, the ending cancels EVERYTHING out. All the hard work and effort you put forth is erased in the last twenty minutes or so of the game. You will walk away feel disheartened, discouraged, and betrayed by the sloppiness BioWare put forth. This game is a crying shame, because a) BioWare has always been brilliant in the past b) the rest of the game is spectacular c)if you, like me, have played since Mass Effect 1, you have become so invested in the series that the thought of this being canon will destroy you like a warp to singularity.",

         "Note: Amazon first made Series 3&4 available via streaming (free for Prime members) several months ago, and another fan of the series made it known to me that Series One and Two are now available via streaming (free for Prime members).<br /><br />Kevin Whately, the consummate actor who portrayed Chief Inspector Morse's (John Thaw) long-suffering Detective Sergeant Lewis on \\\"Inspector Morse\\\", is now Detective Inspector Lewis in \\\"Inspector Lewis\\\", a high quality investigative drama set in the academic town of Oxford, England.<br /><br />Having watched all of the Inspector Morse episodes, I can see the evolution of Lewis' character (brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Whately) from a diligent albeit lowly sergeant under the guidance of the amazing Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) to a confident, outspoken, yet still down to earth DI who now has his own underling in the form of the intellectual, gifted DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox).<br /><br />Season 2 of Inspector Lewis is quite an engaging series, containing many interesting episodes featuring DI Lewis (Kevin Whately) and DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox). Part of what makes Insp. Lewis a charming series for me is the banter between Lewis and the more cerebral, Cambridge-educated (in theology), Hathaway. There's lots to satisfy the discerning viewer in Season 2 - picturesque Oxford, literary references, and riveting plots, not to mention the excellent ensemble cast.<br />Season 2 contains the following episodes:<br /><br />And The Moonbeams Kiss the Sea - One of my favorites of all the Lewis episodes. This is not only well-written, but is also atmospheric. Lewis and Hathaway try to discover the link between two murders. One is of a maintenance worker at Oxford's Bodleain Library, and the other is of a popular art student. As they dig deeper, they find out that the two deaths are related to some high level forgery involving works of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Oxford dons addicted to gambling.<br /><br />Music to Die For - Whilst investigating the murder of an elderly gay lecturer, Lewis finds connections to the world of underground amateur boxing, the East German Secret Police (Stasi), and even Lewis' old mentor Morse.

         "After many happy years with Money (stuck at 2003), being able to manage my financials in a superlative and reliable fashion, the removal of support for is its simple institutional integration forced me to bite the bullet and move to... well, all there is now is Mint and Quicken (now a unified Monopoly, the same one that killed the simple earlier integration with promises of improvement).<br /><br />It is quite possible that at one point Quicken was as good, but the current product is a nightmare of epic proportions. It would appear that after obviously cornering the market, Intuit has done nothing to leverage that into a superior product, instead it degrades with nothing of value left to compare it to. Here is a case where the free market has failed.<br /><br />May I remind everyone, it is pretty simple: a date, a description, a credit or debit amount. And yet, this basic idea is lost in a maze of complexity inundated with failures.<br /><br />While I find he interface poorly designed, a legacy set of junk that appears to have grow over the years such that the basics have fallen through the cracks, I need not waste my time on looking there. Why? Because I can't get my data in, nor trust what is there will be useful in the future.<br /><br />To start, bringing in any of the history we all have requires one to jump though creative nightmarish hoops, for which the result is crap shoot (in the end I made a new \\\"cash account\\\" and imported one account at a time there and \\\"cut 'n paste\\\" into other accounts). Should one get in (either via luck with importing games or by throwing in the towel and abandoning your history), anything goes wrong and you are at the mercy of losing everything due to the complexity. Here, after 30 years of programming, I am entitle to jump to conclusions here about the cause: legacy complexity of too many esoteric features overwhelming the basics.<br /><br />The most important point of a product like this is to gather this simple information from all the varied account interfaces (checking, savings, credit cards, brokerage, retirement) into one central interface. Yet institutional integration is hit or miss, with neither institutions nor Intuit caring.<br /><br />Face it: no one is going to type in all their transactions. So, you darn well better be sure your institution works with Quicken or it will be useless. And, when it breaks, do not expect a fix - you are back to manual. This is the Achilles heel: you can't trust it with your history because you don't know what will happen tomorrow.<br /><br />My conclusions are based on my own experience. My Bank Account would not download until after about 20 useless emails with support over 1 month, where they barely read anything I wrote. In the end I found the problem with Quicken (could not handle two accounts on one institution with the same \\\"account name\\\") by learning about and deciphering the Quicken logs I had sent them. After this they did not care about knowing this shortcoming. And the, one of my three credit cards that was supported was sold to another company without my consent... not supported any longer, and so now what do I do with that history and future? Finally, my major 401k at ADP (not a small company, I am sure you have heard of them) is not supported. Do they care? Will it be? Nope.<br /><br />My conclusions are further supported by searching and finding that this is the same for zillions. How can it be that a company with a Monopoly in this market space gets mediocre and less reviews from most users? It is embarrassing.<br /><br />There are many of you that use Quicken and have settled into a routine since you were lucky enough to find \\\"things that worked\\\". More power to you. But it is just a matter time before it goes bad for you. Probably the next \\\"forced\\\" upgrade, and/or when your financial institution is sold to another in this current way Wall St works.<br /><br />As for new users considering this product: good luck, maybe you to will get\\\"in\\\". But, again, your future is dismal.<br /><br />And for all of us, there is no hope in view. We are worse off than a decade ago, and with each release Quicken deteriorates as shown by intelligent reviews of those who have been with it for years. Alternatively Mint is barely holding on, for those willing to trust all their data to the \\\"Mint\\\" server which could go offline any time just like Intuit's previous online money site \\\"Quicken Online\\\".<br /><br />What am I doing? Well, struggling with Quicken and Mint in parallel daily, hoping to \\\"survive\\\". What a wonderful set of products.",

         "Wrecked (2010) features a man (Adrien Brody) who recovers consciousness in a car that has crashed in a wooded area, and finds himself trapped inside, with only a hazy recollection of how he may have arrived there.  As events unfold, some things become clearer, as the man who has no name, regains some memory.  He also hallucinates however, so you can't always believe what you see.<br /><br />Awaking in the front passenger seat of a vehicle that has crashed, the man finds that his head is bleeding and his legs wedged in under the dashboard.  Through the partially broken windshield, the body of another man lying in the woods is visible, and there is also a dead man in the back seat.  Searching the car, the man finds a revolver, and later imagines that he has been discovered by a woman (Caroline Dhavernas).<br /><br />Eventually, the man is able to force his way out of the vehicle, and splint his apparently fractured leg.  He finds bags stuffed with cash in the trunk, and also makes friends with a large dog.  After recovering enough to travel, he crawls off into the woods to try and find help.  You would assume that a road is nearby above where the car rests, but the man heads in a different direction.  In another questionable move, he attempts to cross a river, and is swept away, coming ashore far downstream.<br /><br />Featuring a nice mix of adventure, mystery, and fantasy, Wrecked is very slow burn that manages to be a mostly interesting watch, while manipulating its audience.  In an intriguing role, where he is in front of the camera for nearly the entire movie, Adrien Broady comes off as fairly credible.  The presence of the dog provides a reason for the man to speak, so he doesn't appear as someone who habitually talks to himself.  You soon come not to trust everything you see, as the fantasy segments keep you off balance, and certain developments, like the appearances of a hungry cougar, and the discovery various objects including a cell phone and several corpses, push the limits of believability.<br /><br />While perhaps not a movie that you will want to buy on DVD, Wrecked is worth a watch on Amazon Prime, for Adrien Brody's semi-edgy performance.  The resolution plays out well enough, but may not be entirely satisfying.s, push the limits of believability.<br /><br />While perhaps not a movie that you will want to buy on DVD, Wrecked is worth a watch on Amazon Prime, for Adrien Brody's semi-edgy performance.

         "For those seeking a review that helps them to decide whether or not to buy this book, my short answer is don't. I'm saddened to have read this awful, awful book. Sad. I want my innocence and time back.<br /><br />I heard an NPR review of the book that glowed, and loved the idea of a sequel to the Austin novel, Pride & Prejudice; a favorite of mine. I love good writing and good stories. The Taipan novels of Clavell, the Dune novels of Hubert, the Potter stories of Rowling, the LORT series by Tolkien; intricate, well thought out, intriguing characters, absorbing plotlines, wry humor, elegant wording. Austin is a master of such stories, even though I have latent wishes for her novels. Much of the action tends to happen \\\"off-stage\\\" in her books and we meet only to hear it talked about. Some of her characters are frustratingly slow to learn. Still, I read and reread P&P to be entertained and entrained once again by Darcy and Elizabeth.<br /><br />So, naturally a glowing recommendation on NPR and the prospect of a sequel to a favorite book caught my interest. Stupidly assuming it would be at least entertaining, I bought the book as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. She read it, and I noticed as she did that she didn't seem impressed. Since it was a gift, she tried not to pan it to me. I quickly read it after her and came to a better understanding of her reaction to it.<br /><br />The book is awful.  Yes, its a disappointment, as some reviewers have said. P.D. James has used the Austin characters without giving them anything like the life or personality they had in the original. P.D. James laboriously restated the events of its prequel (as a matter of the fact, much of the book is a poorer retelling of the previous book) only to plug them into a boring, lifeless new plot. I haven't read any other James' books, but I understand from disappointed reviewers that her other mysteries are detailed, painstaking and gripping; none of these qualities pertained to Death Comes to Pemberley. So, yes the book disappoints expectations. Perhaps my expectations and hopes were high. I tried to consider that any sequel wasn't likely to have Austins flair or pinache, but I still hoped to spend time with my characters again. However, disappointment isn't why I'm giving this the lowest rating I'm allowed. The story is simply awful on every front, in every way. As a novel, a story, everything it fails. I imagine that I can give James only as much credit as one would give a school child for handing in a report: she finished and published a book. That's some kind of an accomplishment. But I can offer little more respect than that.<br /><br />Darcy is made out to be wimpy and relatively unintelligent. Elizabeth has lost her fire and is suddenly a helpless chick who can do little but feel and get lost in thought about times gone by. Colonel Fitzwilliam has become an a-hole. Georgiana is still sweet, smarter, but mis-used in the story, which I'll get to in a moment. Jane is Jane, thank god, but rendered impotent, even problematic by the story. Bingley is loyal but vapid, which is disappointing because you'd expect him to have grown over the years. And Pemberly, which was heaven in P&P, is suddenly besieged by a dangerous forest. That's the character problems. But all sorts of plot points get skewed or unmade as well. What seems to be a deliberate effort is made to exclude the character of Georgiana from an evening of crazy events, building tension around her significance. Then, when she reappears, and throughout the remainder of the book, she is virtually useless and unimportant. A sub-plot is introduced in which Georgiana may choose between two possible suitors, but her preference becomes quite clear in the beginning, never wavers, and the reader is not directed to want it to, ever. All sorts of attention is paid to questions of evidence in the murder, and then the trial becomes all about circumstance and character. Much ado is made of Darcy's reluctance tospeak and torture over whether or not to defend his brother in law, Wickham, then he just does it.<br /><br />As a mystery this book fails to allow the reader to try to work things out on their own. The truly great mysteries give you everything in the story that you need to understand what happened, but somehow still conceal the whole truth, usually by playing with the order in which you get it. The reveal is fun and frustrating because you know you were close to figuring it out, and suddenly realize it was all there. That's fun. It's impressive to feel the detective character was able to work it out, and the author leaves you impressed that they were able to write a gripping story while carefully diverting your attention enough to keep it a mystery to the end.<br /><br />The reveal of Death Comes to Pemberley is utterly obscure, and dull on top of it. No one's really to blame; no one is revealed to have been secretly not what they seemed; much of the truth is only introduced in the reveal so there would have been no way to figure it out beforehand, and justice doesn't appear to be served.  There's no thrill.  There's no frustrating but fun realization. I was left frowning and horrified. \\\"Is that it?!\\\" I exclaimed out loud to my self, and checked the last leafs of paper to see if there was any indication of more story. I couldn't believe I had been so completely let down.<br /><br />So, my frustration is partly with the author. Shame on you P.D. James. For shame.  You can not have possibly written any good books and made a name for yourself and not known how truly awful this book is. So, you phoned something in to try to get a little more money in your old age and knew perfectly well that you were publishing crap. For shame. And to involve Austin's novels in it is double-shame. One might almost think there's a secret hatred or jealousy at work. That at least would be an interesting mystery; better than your book was.  But my great concern is that this book was ever recommended by anyone. What could possibly have happened in these people's minds?  The characters weren't the characters of Austin's novel, so how could they have been entertaining to people who missed them?  The mystery wasn't mysterious, so how could it have garnered appreciation from those who thrill for a good mystery?  The book was laborious and redundant, so how could it be lauded as well written or particularly original?<br /><br />I have to conclude that my suspicion that the publishing industry has a network of fake supporters that are paid to seem like word-of-mouth is actually well in force. No one with any taste or experience in reading would consider this book worth anything better than kindling. It has to be paid talking heads or tasteless pop culture mavins that give this book any credence.<br /><br />Don't fall for it. Please, save yourself!<br /><br />I remember when I started buying Frank Herbert's son's prequels to the Dune books. After Frank Herbert died, his son supposedly discovered a vault of notes his father had made for continuing books in the series and took it upon himself, along with some other professional writer, to continue the tradition.  He chose to write a number of prequels to the original best-selling book, and I suppose eventually write later parts. I purchased and read 2 or 3 of these prequels before I gave up.

The characters weren't the characters of Austin's novel, so how could they have been entertaining to people who missed them?  The mystery wasn't mysterious, so how could it have garnered appreciation from those who thrill for a good mystery?  The book was laborious and redundant, so how could it be lauded as well written or particularly original?  I have to conclude that my suspicion that the publishing industry has a network of fake supporters that are paid to seem like word-of-mouth is actually well in force. No one with any taste or experience in reading would consider this book worth anything better than kindling. It has to be paid talking heads or tasteless pop culture mavins that give this book any credence.  Don't fall for it. Please, save yourself!  I remember when I started buying Frank Herbert's son's prequels to the Dune books. After Frank Herbert died, his son supposedly discovered a vault of notes his father had made for continuing books in the series and took it upon himself, along with some other professional writer, to continue the tradition.  He chose to write a number of prequels to the original best-selling book, and I suppose eventually write later parts. I purchased and read 2 or 3 of these prequels before I gave up. I couldn't stand anymore to have these characters I loved so badly marred. I couldn't stand to have the worlds of Dune so insipidly drained of color and value. I couldn't bear the hope of an interesting plot point repeatedly failing to deliver.

Perhaps there's an interesting one out there. I wish I could rely on reviews and professional critics to help me find one. They've clearly failed in this case. Butif there is a sequel to P&P that's fun and interesting, this book isn't it.  Hope I've been clear. Hope this helps.",

         "For 3/4 of the way through, this book was impressive.  Good writing, if a bit obscure at times,  good character development, a subtle plot, and of course the great tidbits about geology. Even the similes are about geology.  It was compelling enough to forgive the very numerous, and often confusing typos.  How was the author going to wrap this up in a satisfying way?<br />POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT<br />  And then, what was a murder mystery with a volcano in the background became a story about a volcano exploding, with a murder mystery lost in the ash.  And, if I read the word \\\"ash \\\" one more time, I'll probably go blind.  I almost couldn't finish the book, and it had been a page turner.  I want my villains to meet with appropriate ends, not sort of fade away into the mist (or ash).  Also, because this takes place in a real location, in real time, it was very confusing when suddenly we seem to be in a fictional event, since I assume the volcano at Mammoth has not in fact destroyed Mammoth Lakes.  Story telling is an art, and Ms. Dwiggins is relatively new to the genre.  I hope she focuses more on the story, and less on the writing, next time around. Although, I would hesitate to read anything else by her at this point.",

         "I'd like to give this product a glowing five stars. Instead, my rating is a qualified five stars--more 4.5. But I'll err on the high side given this is an incredible game. The plot is as basic as it gets: bog standard individual becomes hero as along the way, s/he amasses an army to defeat an enemy that threatens to destroy the world. The setting is fantasy Middle Ages; characters range from dwarves to elves to humans, each with varying abilities. You can choose to be a warrior (one-handed blade with shield or two-handed greatsword), a mage (staff, although this path allows the character to become a cool arcane warrior wielding blades and staves) or a rogue (swapping between bow and arrow, and two blades/daggers). Through the game's opening character-building feature, you can manipulate the appearance of your character.<br /><br />What makes the game and story so remarkable is the level of character development made possible through interactive dialogue with the party of comrades you collect along the way as well as key figures throughout the story. (This is the case with Bioware games in general.) Your responses affect the course of the relationship with each comrade and, in more than a few cases, the outcome of story. Sometimes, the choices you are asked to make are difficult. You build your character's personality through these dialogues and create levels of intimacy or hostility with your comrades depending your choices. Romance options are available with four characters, and these options allow for two same-sex pairings (hats off to you, Bioware!!).<br /><br />The graphics are gorgeous, especially the rendering of backgrounds. This is a world created with attention to detail, and I can imagine the affection the designers and artists brought to this project.<br /><br />I got this Mac version because I'd played the game on an XBox 360 and was frustrated I couldn't snag screen caps or capture video (I was that captivated!). So I turned to my desktop: an iMac out of the box with no modifications.<br /><br />iMac: 27\\\" screen<br />OS X: Version 10.7.3 (Lion)<br />Processor: 2.7 GHz, Intel Core 15<br />Memory: 4GB 1333 MHz DDR3<br />Graphics: AMD Radeon HD 6770M 512MB<br /><br />Yes, this version can play on Lion. I can play the game with video options set on high, and everything is stunning. Some control features are great; others are irritating, but it didn't take long to get used to them. The biggest problem I had was the frequent crashing (and once the game froze).  I'm used to the crash-prone XBox, but I'd hoped the desktop version would run more smoothly. At least the crashes were consistent: they happened only when I entered a fight and tried pausing the action to set up my attack. This is supposed to be one of the great features of this game: the ability to pause and set up strategy.<br /><br />So I tried to avoid pausing or leaving my character in the thick of things. On the Mac, one way to control the character's position is to right-click the exact place to which you want your character to go. Your character then runs to that place. The same right-click also allows you to select the enemy you wish to target. If you can't pause to select which enemy to attack, you have to select in the heat of battle. Too many clicks trying to select the moving baddies and my game would crash. If I missed clicking on the baddie, my character would race off to the *place* I clicked. This is a big problem when your character's attacks are ranged. Sometimes the battle's over before your hero gets to the spot you intended to mark as a target. Changing the in-game video options to lower settings didn't change the crashing proble.<br /><br />That said, these were obviously frustrations with which I could cope (I'm playing through a second time, still crashing).  I SAVE FREQUENTLY, at anyplace I imagine I'm going to face an enemy. I got tired of long retraces. But within this game with the simple plot is greatness. I adore the characters; much of the party banter is hilarious; the world and those who people it are compelling. It's a tale told well. And as is so often the case, it's the telling that makes all the difference.",

In that episode he heard music that he could not comprehend but make a very big impression on him and when he got back he was focused on recreating the music he heard.<br /><br />I am not so sure about if that really happens or not the truth is I am a very light sleeper. This music helps me to easily concentrate and maintain my sleep. If you have - as lots of parents do -  a baby that don't let you sleep try playing this to your baby. I can almost guarantee it will relax him or her to the point that they will stop crying and go back to sleep. My cat was sleeping almost in front of the speakers!!!<br /><br />With that said the music is not boring or monotonous it just hit the right notes to make feel a pleasant sense of calmness. If you want to meditate I bet that could help you to do that as well.<br /><br />Sounds are very soft and in progression and there is not a drum sound or anything that marks a beat so there is sense of endlessness involved.<br /><br />Sometimes I need to retrieve myself from the craziness of our daily routine to calm myself down. This music is perfect for just that. Highly recommended.",

         "Imagining what a world nearly emptied of humans could look like has a horrific, yet romantic fascination for me. What disasters would Earth face in our absence and how would it regrow and flourish? For the humans that would remain in such a dystopia, what facets of human behavior would survive? In Selection Event, we follow a survivor who had been locked away in an isolation experiment as he struggles against food and fuel scarcity and violent religious fanatics in his efforts to build a functioning community. The world and story premise are promising, but the novel ultimately fails because it lacks forward momentum towards a climax or a central struggle. In addition, most of the characters are disappointingly little more than caricatures.<br /><br />The story begins when Martin Lake, a previously underemployed college graduate, emerges from a year-long, underground isolation to discover the experiment managers dead and zoo animals roaming the property. A new type of flu had wiped out humanity during his year away, he reads in increasingly sparse newspapers. After a relatively undramatic shock and mourning period, we follow Martin and his dog Isha as they encounter a fun-loving bipolar motorcyclist, a crazed cult leader, and a smattering of other random people leftover from humanity's demise.<br /><br />The relationships Martin develops fall under one of two extremes. Either they become best friends, though we rarely get to see the relationship actually disclose into affection, or they become dire enemies--always because the other person is totally insane. There are no stories of people coming together through their differences, since difference always entails fatal clashing, even though the main characters are supposed to be embracing of diversity. Diversity is acceptable when it means disparate background, not when it means divergent world views.<br /><br />Probably the best character is Isha, Martin's dog, who enjoys her own perspective chapters. It's pretty epic that Isha is a main character and that her story is developed quite fully, but it's also telling that the dog is one of the only deep characters and Isha's relationship with her \\\"pet\\\" cat is the relationship with the most narrating.<br /><br />The part of this book I liked best was the very practical struggle for survival that each character had to endure. For example, at first they use leftover gas to power their generators and cars, but when the gas begins to go bad, they have to find new solutions for power and transportation--new solutions that are quite old from the perspective of human history. They have to discover what their most basic needs are and learn to value the small luxuries they can afford. I like a good book that takes me away from my environment and my assumptions and shows me a new, purer or better way of living and this book, seen from the perspective of basic needs and survival, is an interesting journey.<br /><br />Finally, a note on the liberal slate. I am a liberal and I enjoy a good liberal read. That said, I also enjoy genuine explorations of \\\"non-liberal\\\" topics such as religion and power. I want to understand problems with religion, not just told they exist. I want to experience struggles between Christians and atheists in their struggle to rebuild the world, not just shown how magnificently they would clash. I'm sure this novel turns off many Christians or religious people because of its portrayal of every religious person as inherently fanatical and ultimately insane.<br /><br />I think this type of story could be a powerful atmosphere for a deep analysis of evil. Does it exist? Does it reside within humans or are humans at base never evil? Why does a person commit an unspeakable act of emotional or physical violence on another person? Rather than explore evil, this story caricatures it and then all too easily snuffs it out.<br /><br />I see that the author, Wayne Wightman, wrote several books in 2011. I think at least this book couldreally have benefitted from him slowing down, taking a break from his story, and giving it a good story edit. I watched the commentary of Cast Away the other day and the director noted that the screenplay went through 125 drafts. 125 drafts. Incredible. But that's what it takes for mediocre work to become excellent.<br /><br />Overall, I felt like I was reading a draft of a story, and that's too bad because I'd like to have read the final version.really have benefitted from him slowing down, taking a break from his story, and giving it a good story edit.

         "Heavyweights is a great fun comedy for everyone of all ages. The characters are so much fun, daring, hilarious, and sometimes even serious. I love when camp MVP comes over to 'Camp Hope' to try and show off how better they are. Thats when the fun really starts...The kids make smart remarks at camp MVP, and everything they say, and do, is hilarious! One of Jerry's new friends is Josh. He is one of the jokesters that makes this movie worthwhile. Josh'll throw out a lot of jokes here and there, and right from the beginning...you automatically know that he is going to either get in trouble, or throw out a serious joke! When the new owner of 'Camp Hope' is introduced, he takes away all of the candy, sweets, anything fattening so that the kids can lose weight. Now, the kids are furious at all of their candies 'secret hiding places' are. They have nothing left to eat when they're tired of healthy food! A few of Jerry's friends, and him, go into the the new owner's house to look for any kind of sweets there. They don't find any candy, but...they find something, very disturbing. Jerry had written a letter to his grandma about everything going on. The go-karts were destroyed, the blob was punctured, the food was horrible, and his parents wouldn't listen to him. Well, the kids found a locked trunk, hoping that maybe some sweet candy would be in there. Instead, there were all the letters that the kids letters to be sent home to their loved ones! All of the kids think that he's 'sick', and Jerry finds his letter from his grandma! Now, the kids left immediately because the owner was coming! They relax at the restrooms, and Jerry hears 'food' wrapper. Philip yells to go away, and they open the door to find him eating a sandwich! The group of kids demand to know where Philip got the food at and he says 'Okay but you guys got to keep it a secret, okay.' Late at night, kids one by one, go out and grab themselves a piece of food. Even Pat decides to get in on the action along with thekids! This movies is so wonderful, every time that I re-watch it, I laugh over and over again. It makes me feel like when I was five, watching it for the first time. Its a great movie about being heavy, and being proud of who you are and not about what people think of you!",

         "This is the 1st time I've seen this seris and my jaw is on the ground.  In law school, they teach that conspiracies are worse than crimes committed by single actors.  There's a multiplier effect on the evil and efficiency and effectiveness.  This episode was painful to watch as the murders were so senseless and wicked.  I don't know why this case doesn't get that much attention when the killers are pure garbage just like the DC Snipers and the Atlanta Child Murderer.<br /><br />The couple commit many crimes and the show goes through each of them.  After awhile, it gets irritating.  This was different from a show like \\\"Forensic Files\\\" where some scientific truth is the key to getting the killer convicted.  Near the end, we learn a governor commuted the death sentence of the retarded female in the couple.  I think recently the Supreme Court may have ruled that the retarded can't face capital punishment, so this case may have been a forerunner of that.<br /><br />From the 1st minute of the show, I was ready to put these killers up under the jail.  No wonder \\\"wicked\\\" is in the title.  I don't know if this episode will make me avoid the series or become addicted to it.",

         "Mother's Day is a remake of the 1980 horror film and was directed by the guy who brought you 3 of the Saw movies. The score by Bobby Johnston falls in line with the quality of filmmaking on display here. The score does do something interesting by pitting low strings with the high pitched strikes of a piano. It does hold a classic sensibility in that sense. The piano is just a classic instrument and ever since The Exorcist feels like it belongs in the horror genre. While the execution of the score is fantastic I can't say the effect of the score is lasting.<br /><br />The score wears thin pretty quickly and seems to be just trudging along. We get some pretty good tracks here and there, and as a listening experience it does have a great sonic landscape. The score has a unique sound and feel, but it feels as if it were meant for another film. The music never builds towards anything. Structurally it's all on the same level so therefore no tension mounts from the music. The climactic track \\\"Mom Beth Fight\\\" is a 4-minute track that feels like a remix of the main theme, and while it sounds groovy it wasn't matching what I wanted to be feeling. There is in fact an actual remix at the end of the album for those who absolutely needed a techno version of the Mother's Day theme.<br /><br />Mother's Day has some cool elements to it. It has a classic sensibility within its DNA, but as a score it falls short in accomplishing any real narrative progression. We get a great feel, but any emotion or urgency in the music is nowhere to be found. It's worth looking into to hear some tunes from Bobby Johnston, but as a score it misses the mark.",

         "I stumbled upon this video while checking out the streaming section of Amazon Video on my TV. It was listed in the $3 or less section.. While I'm not a prude or care to limit speech, my problems with this video was that it shows up in the middle of quite a few kids choices such as Dumbo and other Pixar movies. I'm well aware of what this content is, but ordered it because I was curious what this really was about. (I'm not ignorant to the entire cash master world, but I do think it's disgusting) I think 5 minutes into the video the word \\\"faggot\\\" was used a hundred times. The interviewer is not a Dr. or actual researcher, he's a porn video producer. If this was a true research video it would be one thing, but the moment the \\\"interviewer\\\" starts laughing with the jacka*s in this video it becomes too clear what this is about. It's a promotional video for this id*ot's little venture of abuse towards gay people. He further goes on to talk about how he's working towards being a Doctor as well, yet as a doctor he would not give gay people good service, rather poor service, which is a violation of the oath. This jacka*s also talks about a future visit with one of his \\\"cash slaves\\\" in which he intends to knock the guy's teeth out because that's what he wants. I get that people enjoy this kind of stuff, but this video has NO place on Amazon Video and not especially sandwiched by about 100 children's titles. This is a HUGE failure on Amazon's part for letting this slip through. This kind of hate and violence is not something that I would expect Amazon.com to allow in their stores. Porn is one thing, but I feel this video completely violates the law.. further, this practice IS real and people DO engage in this stuff. The activities in this video in many places are illegal. Shame on you Amazon. This video needs to go.. if it's not removed, you can kiss my many years of very faithful purchasing from you good bye! (For the record, I spend a LOT of money with Amazon)<br /><br />To be fair, customer service credited back the price for this video. I didn't ask for a credit, I just asked them to remove this trash from my library of rentals. And yes, I only rented it to see what this crap was.",

I was listening to an interview he did with NPR, and it was interesting enough to get me to take a look for myself.<br /><br />I was wrong about Louie.  He is not a buffoon (at least, his character on the show isn't).  This show is depressing and hilarious all at the same time.  I haven't ever seen another show like this - where normal life is portrayed and the depressing is funny and the funny is hilarious.  My favorite thing about this show is that the character is really trying to raise his kids right - you can see that when he tells them they have nothing to complain about, and that they can ask their Aunt why she is racist.<br /><br />And this character is so sweet - the earnestness and sweetness that he has pull at your heart.  It's as if he's the only sane one in the world, and he's standing there watching the world go by, confused and not understanding why people are jerks and idiots.<br /><br />I don't know - I'm usually good with words - but I don't have the words for this.  It's a great show.  Watch the pilot and another episode before you make up your mind (the pilot is not my favorite).",

But it's my oldest and isn't dead yet. lol<br /><br />I been using computers for over 25 years now. So, no, I'm not a newbie at this stuff.<br /><br />My old computer doesn't like this software. It was okay with Norton V.5, but when I updated it to V.6. It started to act funny. It doesn't want to load up my Bios and Win page right. It's all fuzzy. Then, at the actual startup the Norton program sometimes makes it crash. It's not all the time, but it runs longer than 2 mins, I already know there's a problem. Once, I tried to let it go close to 15 mins and it just sits there, loading the program in a cycle. WTF?<br /><br />If the above happens I need to just reset it. This never happened on V.5 but V.6 must be doing something pretty strange and rewrote or deleted a registry key or something.<br /><br />Oh the pain!<br /><br />I know I can just reinstall V.5 again, but don't feel like it now. I leave it at V.6 for now.<br /><br />Yes, I been a Norton user for years now. Started with 2002. Now feel like this is my last year with them. They really changed in my book and NOT for the better. They seemed to be more greedy for money now a days than helping people with computer problems. I know they want people to pay for help and that wasn't like that before.<br /><br />I'm thinking about just getting free malware software programs and free anti virus software next year. Those programs might not be the first choice solutions, but still Norton wants people to pay when they have actual problems now a days. So, I might as well go pay someone else that money when using free program than using a paid program and then paying more for fixes.<br /><br />It's just better way of thinking and I do what I want with my own money!",

This Kindle e-book was a 477 Kb download and was priced at $4.99 at the time of writing this review.<br /><br />Background... I became interested in this novel as I'd really enjoyed the \\\"Yesterday's Gone\\\" series by the same authors. I wanted to try this new full length novel and so downloaded the Kindle edition.<br /><br />***MAJOR SPOILERS***<br /><br />This is the tale of three brothers that come from a different world, all of who have different personal agendas. One (Jacob) wishes to keep a portal open to the 'home' world to bring back an army and conquer Earth. Another, (John, our main hero) wishes to prevent this from happening and the last (Caleb), who has had his memory erased so he's unaware of the other two. Jacob is actively seeking both John and Caleb as they have information that is vital to his plans. In addition, they're all are a new breed of vampire who have different 'requirements' than the traditional vampires of most tales.<br /><br />END SPOILERS<br /><br />Some thoughts...<br /><br />The Pros:<br /><br />1.) an interesting premise using a variation of the normal vampire model.<br /><br />2.) lots of page turning action and intrigue...not much down time (see Cons: 2. below)<br /><br />3.) some nice character development. I really liked what the authors did with Larry and Abigail, as well as John and Caleb.<br /><br />The Cons:<br /><br />1.) I found the plot (early on) confusing... I started to wonder... did I miss something? It wasn't until Part 3 (74% the way through) that some explanations were given to shed some light on the various goings-on in the previous chapters.<br /><br />2.) as mentioned above (Pros: 2.), a book with lots of action and unexpected twists and turns... it's just that there were too many for my liking.  I had, by the end, this feeling that the authors tried to do too much... tried to put too many variables in. Resulting in a myriad of somewhat confusing ideas and unfortunately, blurring the borders of believability (within the context of this tale) more than they needed to be.<br /><br />3.) a main protagonist with near super hero abilities. Roughly half way through I began to realize that he (John) was virtually untouchable no matter how dire the situation he found himself in.<br /><br />4.) many scenarios that surprise the reader with new unexpected information at the last moment that change the outcome of an encounter(s). So much so that I found myself disappointed in how much I had to suspend my sense of realism in this tale...yes, yes, I know it's only fiction. But when things happen that make you roll your eyes, questioning where this came from, you begin to wonder about what audience the work was intended for.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />A good book if your looking for some light escapism and lots of action that revolves around a different breed of vampire.<br /><br />A novel, that by its subject matter was intended for an adult audience but uses techniques often seen in Young Adult novels. i.e. superheroes and stretching the borders of realism with several unexpected escapes that save the day.<br /><br />I started off liking this story very much, but by the end was disappointed with its inability to focus a little more the main plot instead of adding another scenario to the mix.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book... yes, to a selected type of reader.<br />Would I read the next installment... unlikely.<br /><br />As it is... 2 1/2 Stars<br /><br />Ray Nicholsontext of this tale) more than they needed to be.  3.) a main protagonist with near super hero abilities.

Within a day of my posting the negative review, I received an email from Intuit's customer support indicating that my complaints were indeed \\\"fixed\\\" and that I could either run a patch or re-download and most of my issues would be solved.  Well I re-downloaded and all of my issues were indeed resolved.  The programs works flawlessly so far, but I cannot give it a 5 star rating until I am sure there are no hidden issues and that some of the issues I had with Q2012 I see are resolved.  The cloud issues I had are resolved.  The population of tax categories are solved.  With R2 all looks good so far BUT, I have my fingers crossed.<br /><br />In any case, kudos to Intuit for acting so quickly to the flaws in the program.  I have never seen such quick remedy to the enduser by a company as large as Intuit as I witnessed here.  Excellent lesson for others like Adobe, Microsoft, etc.<br /><br />I hope to be able to give the product 5 stars once I see that certain tax categorization issues I experienced in Q2012 are resolved in this release.<br /><br />I never learn my lesson.  I see these new releases and buy them immediately.<br /><br />While this release sounds like it is adding features of use, in reality, right now they don't work.  The Quicken cloud is DOA.  The spinning wheel just keeps spinning and spinning while trying to update the cloud and of course doesn't or can't at this time add your accounts to the cloud.<br /><br />When updating my accounts, I get a message that R2 is available, hoping, there is already a new version to fix problems with this new version.  Clicking on the upgrade, leads to a message that the upgrade is not applicable to your version of Quicken.  Of course I continually get the do you want to apply the upgrade message again and must assume there is indeed an R2 ready or almost ready for release.<br /><br />The account actions button has no been replaced by a tiny button at the top right of the screen which is a minor annoyance but I can live with it.<br /><br />The Tax Center does not work.  It does not populate your data in the respective fields, a real bummer if you pay use Quicken to estimate your taxes in real time like I do.<br /><br />The good news is that by around R3-4, the major bugs are usually worked out in any Quicken release, but it is really getting old to see every new Quicken have so many major bugs and those of us early adopters being used as guinea pigs, despite their supposedly large beta testing.",

         "The best version of Photoshop Elements I've used...",
         "...and I've used most of them since version 3. Still powerful,and fewer annoyances than Photoshop Elements 10.<br /><br />Photoshop Elements (PSE) 11 --like its earlier versions-- is an image editor with enough features to rapidly surpass the skills (and time available to explore!) of even highly skilled amateur photographers. The overall interface will be familiar to user of PSE versions as far back as PSE 6 or 7. PSE 11 incorporates most of the multiple image merge functions familiar to users since PSE 7. As with previous versions, PSE 11 offers this for a fraction of the cost of its big-brother Photoshop CS6. Most amateur photographers --and maybe even some \\\"thrifty\\\" professionals-- can perform all but the most advanced digital editing with PSE 11.<br /><br />Note: This review assumes some familiarity with digital photography and digital image concepts.<br /><br />Installation:<br />-No issues with installation. I tested it on two desktops and a laptop (variously running Windows 7 and Windows 8.. ):<br />-32-bit dual-core 3 GHZ processor, 4 GB of RAM.<br />-64-bit quad-core 3.4 GHZ processor, 16 GB of RAM.<br />-64 but dual-core 1.3 GHZ mobile processor, 4 GB of RAM<br /><br />-I installed PSE 11 on one machine already running PSE 10. Unlike earlier versions, PSE 11 does not require users to decide whether to continue using the earlier version or use the new version exclusively. You have the option to use both version 11 and version 10...and I was able to run them both at the same time.<br /><br />-The license for this product permits installation on one primary and one \\\"mobile\\\" computer, with the restriction not to use on both computers at the same time.<br /><br />-Total installation time after downloading (including entering the registration code and skimming the EULA) was about 15 minutes on each of the machines described above). This was followed by PSE 11's \\\"Organizer\\\" component performing its own indexing of the digital images on the computer. Cataloging over 56,000 digital images took about 35 minutes. Obviously hardware and the volume of images to index will mean variable times for each user...but the indexing was very fast. If you're a Windows user and store your images in a non-default \\\"My Pictures\\\" location under your user name, you'll have to tell PSE where to browse for this indexing. The catalog has multiple sorting options. The chronological sort (based on image file .exif data) is completed automatically during indexing. Three other options (people, place and events) require interaction with the user interface to complete some or all of those sort capabilities.<br /><br />Function and features:<br />-The interface, function and features of PSE 11 will be familiar to users of recent PSE versions. Overall it's cleaner and slightly simplified since version 10. The .psd files are still manipulated using layers and selection tools. The complete range of image effects (\\\"filters\\\"), image enhancement and editing tools are essentially unchanged since version 6. Still present are options to open, edit and save in wide range of file formats.<br /><br />-Output to the printers on my system was trouble-free. Accepting the default printing options yielded fine results, but advanced options for those who like to tweak are readily available. PSE 11 successfully offered options to print to the two physical (laserjet, inkjet) and two virtual (Acrobat and Microsoft Document Writer) printers attached to my desktop.<br /><br />Issues:<br />-PSE 11 and Adobe continue to assume plenty about user connectivity. All of the help files for PSE 11 are online. Select \\\"Help\\\" in the menu bar (or press the \\\"F1\\\" key), and you are not taken to local help files...you are taken to adobe.com. This is fine if you are connected to the Internet, but less fine if you are not (and some people are NOT connected at all times). You can optionally download a 9 MB .pdf user guide. This is an option you'll want to exercise if you anticipate needing help while not online or if you have bandwidth constraints where you work.<br /><br />It did not recognize a multi-function device (printer/scanner/copier) connected via Ethernet for creating new files directly from the scanner.<br /><br />Finally:<br />-PSE 11, like all of its predecessors is feature dense. Even power users of earlier versions will benefit from additional help. In addition to widely available online forums (hosted by Adobe and elsewhere on the web; search popular video sites for step-by-steps on even the most advanced functions), a reference book will improve your user experience. Remember: technology is complicated, and you're not a dummy! Rather than something in yellow and black that calls you names, consider the PSE 11 edition of the [[ASIN:1449316131 \\\"Missing Manual\\\"]] series (also available in a [[ASIN:B009GRX2JE Kindle edition]]).<br /><br />PSE 11 is a powerful image editing tool priced right for consumers. Purchase with confidence, IF you're using version 10, you probably won;t find an upgrade worthwhile, but consider if you don't have a good image editor or PSE version 9 or earlier.<br /><br />I found version 10 to be rather aggressive in encouraging users to participate in its online service (via registration and creation of an \\\"Adobe Online ID\\\". This pressure is happily absent from PSE 11, and is one \\\"feature\\\" I don't miss.<br /><br />Select with confidence!hile not online or if you have bandwidth constraints where you work.<br /><br />It did not recognize a multi-function device (printer/scanner/copier) connected via Ethernet for creating new files directly from the scanner.<br /><br />Finally:<br />-PSE 11, like all of its predecessors is feature dense.

         "I want to talk about music consumption. I'll admit that there are records that I have listened to only once. Even worse, some of these albums I really enjoyed and promised myself to return to for more. Yet never have. Alas, the ever increasing output of sound is creating an exponential lag, begging me to stay current and forego the rest. But I don't like to do that. How else can one keep up? What elegant excuse may I muster to rip through an album in under an hour, while its creator has invested a year or perhaps even more? I suppose the same could be said about film - a two hour glimpse at a multi-million dollar endeavor leaves us with nothing but numbered tomatoes. And that's a shame, don't you think? You do know the feeling. You know of the hours, the tears and the love that is put into anything you've ever touched. The child of your labor deserves more than `eh'. So how can we fix it? How may we commit to consuming with just as much time as put into each work? Science tells us that energy can not be created or destroyed. So where does it go between the artist and his fans? Hmmm... I'm rambling here, perhaps... But all this I think as I prepare to take on a little over three hours of Kreng.<br /><br />And Kreng needs preparation. Like a horror film that you must only see at night, the music of Kreng requires an appropriate time and place. The time must be a hefty chunk. That place must lack the light of day. But if invested wisely, the hours of music will pay off. Kreng creates a multi-layered sonic soundtrack that plays with psyche on very primordial levels. Each note triggers a fear embedded deep within your DNA, passed on by generations scared of witchcraft, gods and ghosts. This is more than your typical dark ambient album, or a collection of theatrical scores. Kreng's music is a film where the director is your mind. And it's an underground cult suspense.<br /><br />A record is left to spin in a corner. An old ballroom dance is echoed outside. A man, dressed in black, with a bowler hat flapping, is playing an organ and smoking a pipe. He turns on the crank and pumps on the bellows. The darkness falls slowly and settles in lumps. The camera zooms on his eyes and the evil. There's someone or something is hiding inside. You look, but get only a glimpse of the shadows, as something dank and dusty cloaks your face. And now your breathing rolls and hastens. You grasp for air through the rips. The pulse and heartbeat piques and quickens. Your instrument drops to the ground. Your bowler hat falls in the dirt. You are the barrel organ player. Your nightmare is Kreng's aural film.<br /><br />Kreng is an alias of Pepijn Caudron, who first appeared on my playlist with his L'Autopsie Ph&eacute;nom&eacute;nale De Dieu released on Miasmah in 2009. Two years later, Caudron released a sophomore album, Grimoire, and subsequently turned even more heads. This wasn't just a document of a recording made for a performance by Abattoir Ferm&eacute;, a Belgian theater company, of which Caudron is a member. The troup puts on a collection of `speechless performances', and some of the past ones include productions titled Phantasmapolis, Mythobarbital, and Tourniquet. Which finally brings me to this box set. Just as the title says, Works for Abattoir Ferm&eacute; 2007 - 2011, is a collection of music from 4 Abattoir plays. Besides Tourniquet and Mythobarbital, the limited edition 4xLP set includes music from Snuff and Monkey. Plus, there's a 10″ record, collecting music from the TV show, Monster!<br /><br />\\\"Each extended side is crafted from an arsenal of samples, disintegrating vinyl and corroded tape, and Caudron manipulates these sounds in a way that belies the sources. Rather than allow the sounds to emerge, they stay trapped beneath swathes of noise, tape delay and oppressive bass giving us a compositions that emerge like a cross between William Basinski, Jerry Goldsmith (circa Alien) and Thomas Koner. `Works for Abattoir Ferm&eacute; is notfor the faint of heart, but for the rest of us it might be just what the Doctor ordered...\\\"<br /><br />The box set is a pretty substantial release for Miasmah (also available as a digital download). I almost wish the label would have put out individual records in installments, to feed my always aching hunger for such music, and to allow for proper consumption and digestion thereof. Which kind of feeds back into my opening statement. Each record in this compilation represents a full theatrical production, which were most likely not intended to be experienced in one shot. That being said, I recommend you listen to each piece uninterrupted, consuming the works in small pieces, approximately 23-minutes in length each. Oh, and in between, perhaps you'll need an intermission. And don't forget to breathe...or the rest of us it might be just what the Doctor ordered...\\\"<br /><br />The box set is a pretty substantial release for Miasmah (also available as a digital download).

         "I have read all of HP Mallory's books all of which i thought have been great easy reads, as many as the other reviews say it pains me to say that i was a little disappointed ....well alot .... in the begging any way. Its been way too long waiting for this book to be released and even though these are good books they dont leave a lasting impression so it is good to be able to jump on the next book whilst its fresh, i suppose this is why there was a lot of re- hashing, which drove me made and i flicked , flicked and flicked some more. I was a little vague and took a while to get into something or more like anything at all really. I dont like the diary entries they  just add to the repetitiveness, Only to get to the end and say \\\"huh\\\" i went straight into reading sneak peak into next book and thought \\\"oooooohhhhhh no please dont make us go to the start again\\\" lets hope its not in the theme of repetitiveness!!  . I think this book has lost its way, as a previous person mentioned i think HP has lost her style somehow and hope we see a bit more of her original style in the next one!<br /><br />Over all its a short book and with all the flicking, toward the end it does get exciting and you keep on wanting to read! so stick with it and dont be afraid to flick, you want miss anything!<br /><br /> I will always purchase HP mallory's books, because she has an exciting and fun imagination, i hope the next book takes us back to the HP we love.<br /><br />OH and a big P.S ....it was the original book covers that had drawn me to HP's books, i dont really like the new character style much at all!

Also I feel as though the speaker goes a little fast especially when the females come on and and the words are put into example sentences.I'm not sure if I'm supposed to try and follow along--well obviously I cant but that being said what is the point of this in the exercise if I can't follow along or understand all of the words being said since they are not all included in the vocab practice?<br />Another thing that I felt would have yielded a better result and would have made learning easier for me is a book that or visual that allows me to see the words that I am saying and trying to learn.<br />For these reasons I cannot give a 5 star review but I can say that I think through continual use of this product I will be able to easily recognize SOME of these words from the vocabulary exercises.<br /><br />I have a windows 7 laptop and this software will not open on it I purchased the instant download of the software and it does not open.

         "A satisfying combat experience, but feels unfinished",
         "As of writing this (6/27/2012) I have to say TERA has some of the best combat I've played in an MMO, but unfortunately it suffers from a general lack of content that will unfortunately leave you wanting more when content delivery is still at a slow pace.  My subscription recently ran out and during that time I was able to raise a character to the current max level (60) and there are a number of startling issues with the content for players that reach this point.<br /><br />First, the bad stuff. There are only a couple of instances (private group-based battle areas) released for the endgame content which are extremely difficult for unorganized pick-up groups and even in Player VS Player servers, the PvP only seems to occur in the open world, which is fairly rare unless you are an aggressor which can net you penalties if you attack people too far under your level of strength.<br /><br />Organized player vs player combat is currently limited to Guild versus Guild combat which I have yet to experience, because I play in a guild with friends that are under my level and not ready for such combat.  Speaking of which, guilds with such low playercounts are severely hindered compared to guilds that amass great hordes of players because small guilds cannot compete for or support a Vanarch status (player rule over a region of the game map) or organize groups to run instances as easily as guilds that have great numbers of players available to group with.<br /><br />One of the most serious issues is the status of automated instance matching at this time.  In this game, parties of five are generated from a pool of available players across ALL servers, greatly increasing the availability of players compared to other MMOs.  Unfortunately, each party requires ONE player marked as a \\\"Tank\\\", ONE player marked as a \\\"Healer\\\", and THREE players marked as damage-dealers.  At this point, there are technically TWO Tank-type classes and TWO healer-type classes, but of the two tank-types, Lancer and Warrior, only the lancer can queue as a tank and since Lancers are quite short in supply across all servers the queue times for dungeons can be extensive outside of peak gameplay hours and it becomes a serious problem as the major quests of the game are tied to these instances.  It is a sort of gameplay hell for anyone that can't get into a big guild, so I recommend anyone that picks this game up to get into a guild and know their role if they want to have an enjoyable endgame experience.<br /><br />In addition to everything, TERA has not been marketed at all, so the playerbase remains fairly low, which exaggerates most of the above issues.<br /><br />Despite all of this, the combat is excellent.  The crafting system is fairly deep and labor intensive, which gives a feeling of accomplishment once you craft something you need after collecting the materials or working for the money to purchase them.  Throughout the game world are BAMs, boss monsters that have to be fought in a way similar to the game Monster Hunter and with around 15 unique BAM types both in instances and in the game world with increasingly more complex attack styles and risks, they are an absolute exhilarating experience to battle.  While transportation can be a bit bothersome from time to time, it is eased by teleport abilities throughout the game world to major quest hubs.  The story picks up late but is actually very good if you pay attention to quests and their flavor text.  There are a number of well-made cutscenes sprinkled throughout the current main story and the characterization of one of the later main villains is fantastic.<br /><br />All in all, the game is definitely worth a subscription if you're into action-based combat and MMOs, but hold off on more than a month until the above issues are fixed.  I know I wrote more about the bad than the good, but that's pretty much ALL the bad stuff there is!  Once that is all cleaned up and content starts churning out, this MMO will end up being one of the classics of our time.",

         "It is very hard for me to rate suspense novels or thrillers very high; often times, it is the same formula, with very little newness. This book is no different. It is another page turner where characters, plot and point will be soon forgotten after reading this ride.  But, it is still a solid thrill at that. Typical \\\"Sociopath Who Terrorizes Family without possible Legal Repercussions\\\" formula is at play here. The writing is superb; at no point did I feel this novel get bogged down, and I have to give props to James Bell for that. The novel moves right along at a brisk pace with some twists here or there.  There is an odd Christian theme inserted throughout the story though (and NO, not odd as in I'm anti-Christianity). It seems like he was trying to add depth to the book by providing this philosophical component of how someone of faith deals with something like a sociopath, since a socipoath is deemed not savable. The attempt seems to come off flat and insincere as a quick way to add another dimension to the story.   This books has received many five star reviews here, and I just don't see it. I think this novel could easily be replaced by the thousand other page turner thrillers out there with the same average to above average results. It is some good entertainment, but it isn't the type of book that will leave a lasting impression.",

         "The last episode of \\\"Black. White.\\\" is really very powerful. There are two families, one white (the Wurgels, Bruno, Carmen and Rose) and one black (the Sparks, Renee, Brian and son Nick) who are now in the last week of a six week social experiment having studio quality make-up applied to them so that the Wurgels appear black and the Sparks appear to be white. The two families have also been living together under one roof in California and they go outside quite a bit to experience what it's like to be a member of another race. Of course, racism is going to be deeply explored here; and while they started out liking each other with some mild anticipatory anxiety tensions have now risen considerably. After all, this is a type of reality TV show, even if it's a particularly intelligent reality TV show, so you know not everything is going to be pretty as people are bound to clash.<br /><br />So much happens in this episode that while it may appear that I'm giving so much away I'm really leaving quite a bit out for you to discover on your own. Tensions have risen to the point where a therapist has been called in yet again to help everyone get along and understand each other better. Renee and Carmen go hiking (a first for Renee) and they try their best to make peace between them--will they be able to do that? Rose is panic-stricken when she realizes that her poetry performance has to come from the heart and not be just another performance she memorizes to entertain people in an audience while Bruno and Brian try their best to sort out their differences.<br /><br />We also see what happens to Nick: His parents have him meet with an ex-gang member to hopefully scare Nick into staying away from the gangster life and it's interesting to watch their family trip to a museum. The museum trip gives Nick a lot of information and much more awareness about the African-American experience and history.<br /><br />There is a party the night before the last day of the experience and more!<br /><br />Overall, people interested in studying racism and the relationship between the black and white communities in America should find this episode and indeed the entire six part series to be extremely thought-provoking and informative. People who appreciate sharp, brainy and insightful reality TV will also want to see this.<br /><br />Overall, people interested in studying racism and the relationship between the black and white communities in America should find this episode and indeed the entire six part series to be extremely thought-provoking and informative.

         "I was prepared not to like this but have come to realize that it is intelligent, engaging, cool, steampunk-filled action.  Of course, those who hold to the classic Sherlock Holmes will never agree and I can't fault them.  But for those who've never read the books and just want to see an action movie .....<br /><br />I enjoyed the plot and the choreographed fight scenes.  I enjoyed Holmes' character and Watson's character, their gypsy allies, and their love/hate relationship.  Prof. Moriarity makes a downright nasty villian, as does his sharpshooting assassin sidekick.  Holmes' nearly supernatural insight & foresight are a stretch, but still very enjoyable.  In a second he looks at a perilous situation (like a fight) and works out the next 10 moves, like a chess Grandmaster.  Watson, his \\\"Bishop\\\", is likewise very enjoyable to watch in action.  There's elements of violence/action mixed in with intelligent scripting and even comedy.  (Like when the sharpshooter has Watson pinned down, but Watson finds a cannon to shoot back at him.  The sharpshooter mutters, \\\"that's not fair\\\" as he scurries away.)  It has LOTS of Steampunk elements - Cool metallic gadgets and \\\"neat\\\" WWI-era armaments, all enhanced by the director's stop-action super detail-oriented techniques and gritty photography.  (I loved the scene: \\\"let's introduce them to little Hansel,\\\" ... a giant cannon!)  Makes you really think that you're watching turn-of-the-century Europe!  But action alone can't make a winning movie, and \\\"A Game of Shadows\\\" delivers the intelligent plot to go along with the action.  Like Dr. Moriarity trying to start a war by using terrorism (predates WWI).  Like our heroes trying to figure out where the next terrorist act will be, or trying to analyze clues for which disguised man is going to shoot the Arch-duke.  It does engage your mind.<br /><br />Some reviewers didn't like the casting of Harris as Moriarity, but that's their totally subjective opinion.  Like which is better, Blue orRed?  I thought he was great (ie you hate him) without being the typical cliched Hollywood villian.<br /><br />Why doesn't it get 5 stars?  Because the director goes over-the-top (arrogance? assumes his fans don't care?) with stupid \\\"stuff.\\\"  For example Holmes' brother is hosting Watson's fiance at his home and he greets her in the morning stark naked. Very stupid and it would never happen in England in 1900!  Also for example the pseudo-gay stuff like making Holmes dress in drag, lie down half-naked during a firefight and tell Watson, \\\"Come lie down with me!\\\"  Just this little over-the-top irritating stuff that knocks it down from 5 to 4 stars.  Also, I'm sure that true Sherlock Holmes fans have never gotten over giving the gig to a very non-British-looking American actor (Robert Downey Jr.), despite his talent and ability to flawlessly speak with a British accent.  But if you've accepted Downey Jr. as Holmes by now, and you don't require adherence to the original Sherlock Holmes character & stories, then this movie is better than the first in my opinion.",

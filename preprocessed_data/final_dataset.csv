Part of what makes Insp. Lewis a charming series for me is the banter between Lewis and the more cerebral, Cambridge-educated (in theology), Hathaway. There's lots to satisfy the discerning viewer in Season 2 - picturesque Oxford, literary references, and riveting plots, not to mention the excellent ensemble cast.<br />Season 2 contains the following episodes:<br /><br />And The Moonbeams Kiss the Sea - One of my favorites of all the Lewis episodes. This is not only well-written, but is also atmospheric. Lewis and Hathaway try to discover the link between two murders. One is of a maintenance worker at Oxford's Bodleain Library, and the other is of a popular art student. As they dig deeper, they find out that the two deaths are related to some high level forgery involving works of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Oxford dons addicted to gambling.<br /><br />Music to Die For - Whilst investigating the murder of an elderly gay lecturer, Lewis finds connections to the world of underground amateur boxing, the East German Secret Police (Stasi), and even Lewis' old mentor Morse. Poor Lewis gets sort of entangled with a beautiful German, but are her motives purely romantic?<br /><br />Life Born of Fire - The death of a gay student, gay bashing, and college politics get to Hathaway since the dead student also happened to be Hathaway's friend and former classmate. There are some truly strange twists in this one.<br /><br />The Great and the Good - An intriguing episode. A young girl Beatrice is found drugged and a victim of rape, and evidence points to a certain Oswald Cooper, who himself ends up garrotted and castrated. The question is: who is the killer and what is the motive?<br /><br />Allegory of Love - A mysterious young woman is found killed, the weapon being an antique Persian mirror. This resembles a scene found in a historical novel written by up and coming Oxford author, Dorian Crane. Then another young woman is threatened, leading Lewis and Hathaway on a desperate search for the truth.<br /><br />The Quality of Mercy - death and Shakespeare meet when the actor playing the role of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice is found murdered. When another murder occurs, Lewis and Hathaway find their hands full as the list of suspects gets longer.<br /><br />The Point of Vanishing - Curious case of a man killed in his own bathtub.<br /><br />I'd recommend the Inspector Lewis series to any fan of quality British crime procedurals.ilst investigating the murder of an elderly gay lecturer, Lewis finds connections to the world of underground amateur boxing, the East German Secret Police (Stasi), and even Lewis' old mentor Morse.

It would appear that after obviously cornering the market, Intuit has done nothing to leverage that into a superior product, instead it degrades with nothing of value left to compare it to. Here is a case where the free market has failed.<br /><br />May I remind everyone, it is pretty simple: a date, a description, a credit or debit amount. And yet, this basic idea is lost in a maze of complexity inundated with failures.<br /><br />While I find he interface poorly designed, a legacy set of junk that appears to have grow over the years such that the basics have fallen through the cracks, I need not waste my time on looking there. Why? Because I can't get my data in, nor trust what is there will be useful in the future.<br /><br />To start, bringing in any of the history we all have requires one to jump though creative nightmarish hoops, for which the result is crap shoot (in the end I made a new \""cash account\"" and imported one account at a time there and \""cut 'n paste\"" into other accounts). Should one get in (either via luck with importing games or by throwing in the towel and abandoning your history), anything goes wrong and you are at the mercy of losing everything due to the complexity. Here, after 30 years of programming, I am entitle to jump to conclusions here about the cause: legacy complexity of too many esoteric features overwhelming the basics.<br /><br />The most important point of a product like this is to gather this simple information from all the varied account interfaces (checking, savings, credit cards, brokerage, retirement) into one central interface. Yet institutional integration is hit or miss, with neither institutions nor Intuit caring.<br /><br />Face it: no one is going to type in all their transactions. So, you darn well better be sure your institution works with Quicken or it will be useless. And, when it breaks, do not expect a fix - you are back to manual. This is the Achilles heel: you can't trust it with your history because you don't know what will happen tomorrow.<br /><br />My conclusions are based on my own experience. My Bank Account would not download until after about 20 useless emails with support over 1 month, where they barely read anything I wrote. In the end I found the problem with Quicken (could not handle two accounts on one institution with the same \""account name\"") by learning about and deciphering the Quicken logs I had sent them. After this they did not care about knowing this shortcoming. And the, one of my three credit cards that was supported was sold to another company without my consent... not supported any longer, and so now what do I do with that history and future? Finally, my major 401k at ADP (not a small company, I am sure you have heard of them) is not supported. Do they care? Will it be? Nope.<br /><br />My conclusions are further supported by searching and finding that this is the same for zillions. How can it be that a company with a Monopoly in this market space gets mediocre and less reviews from most users? It is embarrassing.<br /><br />There are many of you that use Quicken and have settled into a routine since you were lucky enough to find \""things that worked\"". More power to you. But it is just a matter time before it goes bad for you. Probably the next \""forced\"" upgrade, and/or when your financial institution is sold to another in this current way Wall St works.<br /><br />As for new users considering this product: good luck, maybe you to will get\""in\"". But, again, your future is dismal.<br /><br />And for all of us, there is no hope in view. We are worse off than a decade ago, and with each release Quicken deteriorates as shown by intelligent reviews of those who have been with it for years. Alternatively Mint is barely holding on, for those willing to trust all their data to the \""Mint\"" server which could go offline any time just like Intuit's previous online money site \""Quicken Online\"".<br /><br />What am I doing? Well, struggling with Quicken and Mint in parallel daily, hoping to \""survive\"". What a wonderful set of products.",2012-06-02,808,extra_long,2012-06,software
US,42158096,RALY8YBIFXNU6,B005JWGDI2,27083616,Wrecked,Digital_Video_Download,3,2,3,False,False,fairly engaging tale of survival and discovery...,"Wrecked (2010) features a man (Adrien Brody) who recovers consciousness in a car that has crashed in a wooded area, and finds himself trapped inside, with only a hazy recollection of how he may have arrived there.  As events unfold, some things become clearer, as the man who has no name, regains some memory.  He also hallucinates however, so you can't always believe what you see.<br /><br />Awaking in the front passenger seat of a vehicle that has crashed, the man finds that his head is bleeding and his legs wedged in under the dashboard.  Through the partially broken windshield, the body of another man lying in the woods is visible, and there is also a dead man in the back seat.  Searching the car, the man finds a revolver, and later imagines that he has been discovered by a woman (Caroline Dhavernas).<br /><br />Eventually, the man is able to force his way out of the vehicle, and splint his apparently fractured leg.  He finds bags stuffed with cash in the trunk, and also makes friends with a large dog.  After recovering enough to travel, he crawls off into the woods to try and find help.  You would assume that a road is nearby above where the car rests, but the man heads in a different direction.  In another questionable move, he attempts to cross a river, and is swept away, coming ashore far downstream.<br /><br />Featuring a nice mix of adventure, mystery, and fantasy, Wrecked is very slow burn that manages to be a mostly interesting watch, while manipulating its audience.  In an intriguing role, where he is in front of the camera for nearly the entire movie, Adrien Broady comes off as fairly credible.  The presence of the dog provides a reason for the man to speak, so he doesn't appear as someone who habitually talks to himself.  You soon come not to trust everything you see, as the fantasy segments keep you off balance, and certain developments, like the appearances of a hungry cougar, and the discovery various objects including a cell phone and several corpses, push the limits of believability.<br /><br />While perhaps not a movie that you will want to buy on DVD, Wrecked is worth a watch on Amazon Prime, for Adrien Brody's semi-edgy performance.

US,48920854,R15CRLXRXMR84Q,B0060AY6FO,812972293,Death Comes to Pemberley,Digital_Ebook_Purchase,1,48,53,False,False,Complete disappointment.,"For those seeking a review that helps them to decide whether or not to buy this book, my short answer is don't. I'm saddened to have read this awful, awful book. Sad. I want my innocence and time back.<br /><br />I heard an NPR review of the book that glowed, and loved the idea of a sequel to the Austin novel, Pride & Prejudice; a favorite of mine. I love good writing and good stories. The Taipan novels of Clavell, the Dune novels of Hubert, the Potter stories of Rowling, the LORT series by Tolkien; intricate, well thought out, intriguing characters, absorbing plotlines, wry humor, elegant wording. Austin is a master of such stories, even though I have latent wishes for her novels. Much of the action tends to happen \""off-stage\"" in her books and we meet only to hear it talked about. Some of her characters are frustratingly slow to learn. Still, I read and reread P&P to be entertained and entrained once again by Darcy and Elizabeth.<br /><br />So, naturally a glowing recommendation on NPR and the prospect of a sequel to a favorite book caught my interest. Stupidly assuming it would be at least entertaining, I bought the book as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. She read it, and I noticed as she did that she didn't seem impressed. Since it was a gift, she tried not to pan it to me. I quickly read it after her and came to a better understanding of her reaction to it.<br /><br />The book is awful.  Yes, its a disappointment, as some reviewers have said. P.D. James has used the Austin characters without giving them anything like the life or personality they had in the original. P.D. James laboriously restated the events of its prequel (as a matter of the fact, much of the book is a poorer retelling of the previous book) only to plug them into a boring, lifeless new plot. I haven't read any other James' books, but I understand from disappointed reviewers that her other mysteries are detailed, painstaking and gripping; none of these qualities pertained to Death Comes to Pemberley. So, yes the book disappoints expectations. Perhaps my expectations and hopes were high. I tried to consider that any sequel wasn't likely to have Austins flair or pinache, but I still hoped to spend time with my characters again. However, disappointment isn't why I'm giving this the lowest rating I'm allowed. The story is simply awful on every front, in every way. As a novel, a story, everything it fails. I imagine that I can give James only as much credit as one would give a school child for handing in a report: she finished and published a book. That's some kind of an accomplishment. But I can offer little more respect than that.<br /><br />Darcy is made out to be wimpy and relatively unintelligent. Elizabeth has lost her fire and is suddenly a helpless chick who can do little but feel and get lost in thought about times gone by. Colonel Fitzwilliam has become an a-hole. Georgiana is still sweet, smarter, but mis-used in the story, which I'll get to in a moment. Jane is Jane, thank god, but rendered impotent, even problematic by the story. Bingley is loyal but vapid, which is disappointing because you'd expect him to have grown over the years. And Pemberly, which was heaven in P&P, is suddenly besieged by a dangerous forest. That's the character problems. But all sorts of plot points get skewed or unmade as well. What seems to be a deliberate effort is made to exclude the character of Georgiana from an evening of crazy events, building tension around her significance. Then, when she reappears, and throughout the remainder of the book, she is virtually useless and unimportant. A sub-plot is introduced in which Georgiana may choose between two possible suitors, but her preference becomes quite clear in the beginning, never wavers, and the reader is not directed to want it to, ever. All sorts of attention is paid to questions of evidence in the murder, and then the trial becomes all about circumstance and character. Much ado is made of Darcy's reluctance tospeak and torture over whether or not to defend his brother in law, Wickham, then he just does it.<br /><br />As a mystery this book fails to allow the reader to try to work things out on their own. The truly great mysteries give you everything in the story that you need to understand what happened, but somehow still conceal the whole truth, usually by playing with the order in which you get it. The reveal is fun and frustrating because you know you were close to figuring it out, and suddenly realize it was all there. That's fun. It's impressive to feel the detective character was able to work it out, and the author leaves you impressed that they were able to write a gripping story while carefully diverting your attention enough to keep it a mystery to the end.<br /><br />The reveal of Death Comes to Pemberley is utterly obscure, and dull on top of it. No one's really to blame; no one is revealed to have been secretly not what they seemed; much of the truth is only introduced in the reveal so there would have been no way to figure it out beforehand, and justice doesn't appear to be served.  There's no thrill.  There's no frustrating but fun realization. I was left frowning and horrified. \""Is that it?!\"" I exclaimed out loud to my self, and checked the last leafs of paper to see if there was any indication of more story. I couldn't believe I had been so completely let down.<br /><br />So, my frustration is partly with the author. Shame on you P.D. James. For shame.  You can not have possibly written any good books and made a name for yourself and not known how truly awful this book is. So, you phoned something in to try to get a little more money in your old age and knew perfectly well that you were publishing crap. For shame. And to involve Austin's novels in it is double-shame. One might almost think there's a secret hatred or jealousy at work. That at least would be an interesting mystery; better than your book was.  But my great concern is that this book was ever recommended by anyone. What could possibly have happened in these people's minds?  The characters weren't the characters of Austin's novel, so how could they have been entertaining to people who missed them?  The mystery wasn't mysterious, so how could it have garnered appreciation from those who thrill for a good mystery?  The book was laborious and redundant, so how could it be lauded as well written or particularly original?<br /><br />I have to conclude that my suspicion that the publishing industry has a network of fake supporters that are paid to seem like word-of-mouth is actually well in force. No one with any taste or experience in reading would consider this book worth anything better than kindling. It has to be paid talking heads or tasteless pop culture mavins that give this book any credence.<br /><br />Don't fall for it. Please, save yourself!<br /><br />I remember when I started buying Frank Herbert's son's prequels to the Dune books. After Frank Herbert died, his son supposedly discovered a vault of notes his father had made for continuing books in the series and took it upon himself, along with some other professional writer, to continue the tradition.  He chose to write a number of prequels to the original best-selling book, and I suppose eventually write later parts. I purchased and read 2 or 3 of these prequels before I gave up. I couldn't stand anymore to have these characters I loved so badly marred. I couldn't stand to have the worlds of Dune so insipidly drained of color and value. I couldn't bear the hope of an interesting plot point repeatedly failing to deliver. I wanted to remember the Dune series as it was, so I stopped reading the bad stuff, and I haven't followed what happened to the son since.  I recommend to you readers that you leave the P&P as it was.<br /><br />I've read reviews that indicate that other people have attempted sequels, and I believe that a good one is possible. Perhaps there's an interesting one out there. I wish Icould rely on reviews and professional critics to help me find one. They've clearly failed in this case. But if there is a sequel to P&P that's fun and interesting, this book isn't it.<br /><br />Hope I've been clear. Hope this helps.ple's minds?

Good writing, if a bit obscure at times,  good character development, a subtle plot, and of course the great tidbits about geology. Even the similes are about geology.

And, if I read the word \""ash \"" one more time, I'll probably go blind.  I almost couldn't finish the book, and it had been a page turner.  I want my villains to meet with appropriate ends, not sort of fade away into the mist (or ash).  Also, because this takes place in a real location, in real time, it was very confusing when suddenly we seem to be in a fictional event, since I assume the volcano at Mammoth has not in fact destroyed Mammoth Lakes.

Instead, my rating is a qualified five stars--more 4.5. But I'll err on the high side given this is an incredible game. The plot is as basic as it gets: bog standard individual becomes hero as along the way, s/he amasses an army to defeat an enemy that threatens to destroy the world. The setting is fantasy Middle Ages; characters range from dwarves to elves to humans, each with varying abilities. You can choose to be a warrior (one-handed blade with shield or two-handed greatsword), a mage (staff, although this path allows the character to become a cool arcane warrior wielding blades and staves) or a rogue (swapping between bow and arrow, and two blades/daggers). Through the game's opening character-building feature, you can manipulate the appearance of your character.<br /><br />What makes the game and story so remarkable is the level of character development made possible through interactive dialogue with the party of comrades you collect along the way as well as key figures throughout the story. (This is the case with Bioware games in general.) Your responses affect the course of the relationship with each comrade and, in more than a few cases, the outcome of story. Sometimes, the choices you are asked to make are difficult. You build your character's personality through these dialogues and create levels of intimacy or hostility with your comrades depending your choices. Romance options are available with four characters, and these options allow for two same-sex pairings (hats off to you, Bioware!!).<br /><br />The graphics are gorgeous, especially the rendering of backgrounds. This is a world created with attention to detail, and I can imagine the affection the designers and artists brought to this project.<br /><br />I got this Mac version because I'd played the game on an XBox 360 and was frustrated I couldn't snag screen caps or capture video (I was that captivated!). So I turned to my desktop: an iMac out of the box with no modifications.<br /><br />iMac: 27\"" screen<br />OS X: Version 10.7.3 (Lion)<br />Processor: 2.7 GHz, Intel Core 15<br />Memory: 4GB 1333 MHz DDR3<br />Graphics: AMD Radeon HD 6770M 512MB<br /><br />Yes, this version can play on Lion. I can play the game with video options set on high, and everything is stunning. Some control features are great; others are irritating, but it didn't take long to get used to them. The biggest problem I had was the frequent crashing (and once the game froze).  I'm used to the crash-prone XBox, but I'd hoped the desktop version would run more smoothly. At least the crashes were consistent: they happened only when I entered a fight and tried pausing the action to set up my attack. This is supposed to be one of the great features of this game: the ability to pause and set up strategy.<br /><br />So I tried to avoid pausing or leaving my character in the thick of things. On the Mac, one way to control the character's position is to right-click the exact place to which you want your character to go. Your character then runs to that place. The same right-click also allows you to select the enemy you wish to target. If you can't pause to select which enemy to attack, you have to select in the heat of battle. Too many clicks trying to select the moving baddies and my game would crash. If I missed clicking on the baddie, my character would race off to the *place* I clicked. This is a big problem when your character's attacks are ranged. Sometimes the battle's over before your hero gets to the spot you intended to mark as a target. Changing the in-game video options to lower settings didn't change the crashing proble.<br /><br />That said, these were obviously frustrations with which I could cope (I'm playing through a second time, still crashing).  I SAVE FREQUENTLY, at anyplace I imagine I'm going to face an enemy. I got tired of long retraces. But within this game with the simple plot is greatness. I adore the characters; much of the party banter is hilarious; the world and those who people it are compelling. It's a tale told well.

US,21515989,R1LOWK2UYAXO86,B004XNNGDS,714199034,Selection Event,Digital_Ebook_Purchase,2,2,4,False,False,Caricatured characters and directionless plot biggest problems,"Imagining what a world nearly emptied of humans could look like has a horrific, yet romantic fascination for me. What disasters would Earth face in our absence and how would it regrow and flourish? For the humans that would remain in such a dystopia, what facets of human behavior would survive? In Selection Event, we follow a survivor who had been locked away in an isolation experiment as he struggles against food and fuel scarcity and violent religious fanatics in his efforts to build a functioning community. The world and story premise are promising, but the novel ultimately fails because it lacks forward momentum towards a climax or a central struggle. In addition, most of the characters are disappointingly little more than caricatures.<br /><br />The story begins when Martin Lake, a previously underemployed college graduate, emerges from a year-long, underground isolation to discover the experiment managers dead and zoo animals roaming the property. A new type of flu had wiped out humanity during his year away, he reads in increasingly sparse newspapers. After a relatively undramatic shock and mourning period, we follow Martin and his dog Isha as they encounter a fun-loving bipolar motorcyclist, a crazed cult leader, and a smattering of other random people leftover from humanity's demise.<br /><br />The relationships Martin develops fall under one of two extremes. Either they become best friends, though we rarely get to see the relationship actually disclose into affection, or they become dire enemies--always because the other person is totally insane. There are no stories of people coming together through their differences, since difference always entails fatal clashing, even though the main characters are supposed to be embracing of diversity. Diversity is acceptable when it means disparate background, not when it means divergent world views.<br /><br />Probably the best character is Isha, Martin's dog, who enjoys her own perspective chapters. It's pretty epic that Isha is a main character and that her story is developed quite fully, but it's also telling that the dog is one of the only deep characters and Isha's relationship with her \""pet\"" cat is the relationship with the most narrating.<br /><br />The part of this book I liked best was the very practical struggle for survival that each character had to endure. For example, at first they use leftover gas to power their generators and cars, but when the gas begins to go bad, they have to find new solutions for power and transportation--new solutions that are quite old from the perspective of human history. They have to discover what their most basic needs are and learn to value the small luxuries they can afford. I like a good book that takes me away from my environment and my assumptions and shows me a new, purer or better way of living and this book, seen from the perspective of basic needs and survival, is an interesting journey.<br /><br />Finally, a note on the liberal slate. I am a liberal and I enjoy a good liberal read. That said, I also enjoy genuine explorations of \""non-liberal\"" topics such as religion and power. I want to understand problems with religion, not just told they exist. I want to experience struggles between Christians and atheists in their struggle to rebuild the world, not just shown how magnificently they would clash. I'm sure this novel turns off many Christians or religious people because of its portrayal of every religious person as inherently fanatical and ultimately insane.<br /><br />I think this type of story could be a powerful atmosphere for a deep analysis of evil. Does it exist? Does it reside within humans or are humans at base never evil? Why does a person commit an unspeakable act of emotional or physical violence on another person? Rather than explore evil, this story caricatures it and then all too easily snuffs it out.<br /><br />I see that the author, Wayne Wightman, wrote several books in 2011. I think at least this book couldreally have benefitted from him slowing down, taking a break from his story, and giving it a good story edit. I watched the commentary of Cast Away the other day and the director noted that the screenplay went through 125 drafts. 125 drafts. Incredible.

He is one of the jokesters that makes this movie worthwhile. Josh'll throw out a lot of jokes here and there, and right from the beginning...you automatically know that he is going to either get in trouble, or throw out a serious joke! When the new owner of 'Camp Hope' is introduced, he takes away all of the candy, sweets, anything fattening so that the kids can lose weight. Now, the kids are furious at all of their candies 'secret hiding places' are. They have nothing left to eat when they're tired of healthy food! A few of Jerry's friends, and him, go into the the new owner's house to look for any kind of sweets there. They don't find any candy, but...they find something, very disturbing. Jerry had written a letter to his grandma about everything going on. The go-karts were destroyed, the blob was punctured, the food was horrible, and his parents wouldn't listen to him. Well, the kids found a locked trunk, hoping that maybe some sweet candy would be in there. Instead, there were all the letters that the kids letters to be sent home to their loved ones! All of the kids think that he's 'sick', and Jerry finds his letter from his grandma! Now, the kids left immediately because the owner was coming! They relax at the restrooms, and Jerry hears 'food' wrapper. Philip yells to go away, and they open the door to find him eating a sandwich! The group of kids demand to know where Philip got the food at and he says 'Okay but you guys got to keep it a secret, okay.' Late at night, kids one by one, go out and grab themselves a piece of food. Even Pat decides to get in on the action along with thekids!

The score by Bobby Johnston falls in line with the quality of filmmaking on display here. The score does do something interesting by pitting low strings with the high pitched strikes of a piano. It does hold a classic sensibility in that sense. The piano is just a classic instrument and ever since The Exorcist feels like it belongs in the horror genre. While the execution of the score is fantastic I can't say the effect of the score is lasting.<br /><br />The score wears thin pretty quickly and seems to be just trudging along. We get some pretty good tracks here and there, and as a listening experience it does have a great sonic landscape. The score has a unique sound and feel, but it feels as if it were meant for another film. The music never builds towards anything. Structurally it's all on the same level so therefore no tension mounts from the music. The climactic track \""Mom Beth Fight\"" is a 4-minute track that feels like a remix of the main theme, and while it sounds groovy it wasn't matching what I wanted to be feeling. There is in fact an actual remix at the end of the album for those who absolutely needed a techno version of the Mother's Day theme.<br /><br />Mother's Day has some cool elements to it. It has a classic sensibility within its DNA, but as a score it falls short in accomplishing any real narrative progression. We get a great feel, but any emotion or urgency in the music is nowhere to be found.

It was listed in the $3 or less section.. While I'm not a prude or care to limit speech, my problems with this video was that it shows up in the middle of quite a few kids choices such as Dumbo and other Pixar movies. I'm well aware of what this content is, but ordered it because I was curious what this really was about. (I'm not ignorant to the entire cash master world, but I do think it's disgusting) I think 5 minutes into the video the word \""faggot\"" was used a hundred times. The interviewer is not a Dr. or actual researcher, he's a porn video producer. If this was a true research video it would be one thing, but the moment the \""interviewer\"" starts laughing with the jacka*s in this video it becomes too clear what this is about. It's a promotional video for this id*ot's little venture of abuse towards gay people. He further goes on to talk about how he's working towards being a Doctor as well, yet as a doctor he would not give gay people good service, rather poor service, which is a violation of the oath. This jacka*s also talks about a future visit with one of his \""cash slaves\"" in which he intends to knock the guy's teeth out because that's what he wants.

I tested it on two desktops and a laptop (variously running Windows 7 and Windows 8.. ):<br />-32-bit dual-core 3 GHZ processor, 4 GB of RAM.<br />-64-bit quad-core 3.4 GHZ processor, 16 GB of RAM.<br />-64 but dual-core 1.3 GHZ mobile processor, 4 GB of RAM<br /><br />-I installed PSE 11 on one machine already running PSE 10. Unlike earlier versions, PSE 11 does not require users to decide whether to continue using the earlier version or use the new version exclusively. You have the option to use both version 11 and version 10...and I was able to run them both at the same time.<br /><br />-The license for this product permits installation on one primary and one \""mobile\"" computer, with the restriction not to use on both computers at the same time.<br /><br />-Total installation time after downloading (including entering the registration code and skimming the EULA) was about 15 minutes on each of the machines described above). This was followed by PSE 11's \""Organizer\"" component performing its own indexing of the digital images on the computer. Cataloging over 56,000 digital images took about 35 minutes. Obviously hardware and the volume of images to index will mean variable times for each user...but the indexing was very fast. If you're a Windows user and store your images in a non-default \""My Pictures\"" location under your user name, you'll have to tell PSE where to browse for this indexing. The catalog has multiple sorting options. The chronological sort (based on image file .exif data) is completed automatically during indexing. Three other options (people, place and events) require interaction with the user interface to complete some or all of those sort capabilities.<br /><br />Function and features:<br />-The interface, function and features of PSE 11 will be familiar to users of recent PSE versions. Overall it's cleaner and slightly simplified since version 10. The .psd files are still manipulated using layers and selection tools. The complete range of image effects (\""filters\""), image enhancement and editing tools are essentially unchanged since version 6. Still present are options to open, edit and save in wide range of file formats.<br /><br />-Output to the printers on my system was trouble-free. Accepting the default printing options yielded fine results, but advanced options for those who like to tweak are readily available. PSE 11 successfully offered options to print to the two physical (laserjet, inkjet) and two virtual (Acrobat and Microsoft Document Writer) printers attached to my desktop.<br /><br />Issues:<br />-PSE 11 and Adobe continue to assume plenty about user connectivity. All of the help files for PSE 11 are online. Select \""Help\"" in the menu bar (or press the \""F1\"" key), and you are not taken to local help files...you are taken to adobe.com. This is fine if you are connected to the Internet, but less fine if you are not (and some people are NOT connected at all times). You can optionally download a 9 MB .pdf user guide. This is an option you'll want to exercise if you anticipate needing help while not online or if you have bandwidth constraints where you work.<br /><br />It did not recognize a multi-function device (printer/scanner/copier) connected via Ethernet for creating new files directly from the scanner.<br /><br />Finally:<br />-PSE 11, like all of its predecessors is feature dense. Even power users of earlier versions will benefit from additional help. In addition to widely available online forums (hosted by Adobe and elsewhere on the web; search popular video sites for step-by-steps on even the most advanced functions), a reference book will improve your user experience. Remember: technology is complicated, and you're not a dummy! Rather than something in yellow and black that calls you names, consider the PSE 11 edition of the [[ASIN:1449316131 \""Missing Manual\""]] series (also available in a [[ASIN:B009GRX2JE Kindle edition]]).<br /><br />PSE 11 is a powerful image editing tool priced right for consumers. Purchase with confidence, IF you're using version 10, you probably won;t find an upgrade worthwhile, but consider if you don't have a good image editor or PSE version 9 or earlier.<br /><br />I found version 10 to be rather aggressive in encouraging users to participate in its online service (via registration and creation of an \""Adobe Online ID\"".

US,52845989,R3QBAAV7C94RZ3,B008SMRRWG,991463999,Box Set - Works for Abattoir Fermé 2007 - 2011,Digital_Music_Purchase,5,3,3,False,False,Headphone Commute Review,"I want to talk about music consumption. I'll admit that there are records that I have listened to only once. Even worse, some of these albums I really enjoyed and promised myself to return to for more. Yet never have. Alas, the ever increasing output of sound is creating an exponential lag, begging me to stay current and forego the rest. But I don't like to do that. How else can one keep up? What elegant excuse may I muster to rip through an album in under an hour, while its creator has invested a year or perhaps even more? I suppose the same could be said about film - a two hour glimpse at a multi-million dollar endeavor leaves us with nothing but numbered tomatoes. And that's a shame, don't you think? You do know the feeling. You know of the hours, the tears and the love that is put into anything you've ever touched. The child of your labor deserves more than `eh'. So how can we fix it? How may we commit to consuming with just as much time as put into each work? Science tells us that energy can not be created or destroyed. So where does it go between the artist and his fans? Hmmm... I'm rambling here, perhaps... But all this I think as I prepare to take on a little over three hours of Kreng.<br /><br />And Kreng needs preparation. Like a horror film that you must only see at night, the music of Kreng requires an appropriate time and place. The time must be a hefty chunk. That place must lack the light of day. But if invested wisely, the hours of music will pay off. Kreng creates a multi-layered sonic soundtrack that plays with psyche on very primordial levels. Each note triggers a fear embedded deep within your DNA, passed on by generations scared of witchcraft, gods and ghosts. This is more than your typical dark ambient album, or a collection of theatrical scores. Kreng's music is a film where the director is your mind. And it's an underground cult suspense.<br /><br />A record is left to spin in a corner. An old ballroom dance is echoed outside. A man, dressed in black, with a bowler hat flapping, is playing an organ and smoking a pipe. He turns on the crank and pumps on the bellows. The darkness falls slowly and settles in lumps. The camera zooms on his eyes and the evil. There's someone or something is hiding inside. You look, but get only a glimpse of the shadows, as something dank and dusty cloaks your face. And now your breathing rolls and hastens. You grasp for air through the rips. The pulse and heartbeat piques and quickens. Your instrument drops to the ground. Your bowler hat falls in the dirt. You are the barrel organ player. Your nightmare is Kreng's aural film.<br /><br />Kreng is an alias of Pepijn Caudron, who first appeared on my playlist with his L'Autopsie Ph&eacute;nom&eacute;nale De Dieu released on Miasmah in 2009. Two years later, Caudron released a sophomore album, Grimoire, and subsequently turned even more heads. This wasn't just a document of a recording made for a performance by Abattoir Ferm&eacute;, a Belgian theater company, of which Caudron is a member. The troup puts on a collection of `speechless performances', and some of the past ones include productions titled Phantasmapolis, Mythobarbital, and Tourniquet. Which finally brings me to this box set. Just as the title says, Works for Abattoir Ferm&eacute; 2007 - 2011, is a collection of music from 4 Abattoir plays. Besides Tourniquet and Mythobarbital, the limited edition 4xLP set includes music from Snuff and Monkey. Plus, there's a 10″ record, collecting music from the TV show, Monster!<br /><br />\""Each extended side is crafted from an arsenal of samples, disintegrating vinyl and corroded tape, and Caudron manipulates these sounds in a way that belies the sources. Rather than allow the sounds to emerge, they stay trapped beneath swathes of noise, tape delay and oppressive bass giving us a compositions that emerge like a cross between William Basinski, Jerry Goldsmith (circa Alien) and Thomas Koner. `Works for Abattoir Ferm&eacute; is notfor the faint of heart, but for the rest of us it might be just what the Doctor ordered...\""<br /><br />The box set is a pretty substantial release for Miasmah (also available as a digital download). I almost wish the label would have put out individual records in installments, to feed my always aching hunger for such music, and to allow for proper consumption and digestion thereof. Which kind of feeds back into my opening statement. Each record in this compilation represents a full theatrical production, which were most likely not intended to be experienced in one shot. That being said, I recommend you listen to each piece uninterrupted, consuming the works in small pieces, approximately 23-minutes in length each. Oh, and in between, perhaps you'll need an intermission.

My subscription recently ran out and during that time I was able to raise a character to the current max level (60) and there are a number of startling issues with the content for players that reach this point.<br /><br />First, the bad stuff. There are only a couple of instances (private group-based battle areas) released for the endgame content which are extremely difficult for unorganized pick-up groups and even in Player VS Player servers, the PvP only seems to occur in the open world, which is fairly rare unless you are an aggressor which can net you penalties if you attack people too far under your level of strength.<br /><br />Organized player vs player combat is currently limited to Guild versus Guild combat which I have yet to experience, because I play in a guild with friends that are under my level and not ready for such combat.  Speaking of which, guilds with such low playercounts are severely hindered compared to guilds that amass great hordes of players because small guilds cannot compete for or support a Vanarch status (player rule over a region of the game map) or organize groups to run instances as easily as guilds that have great numbers of players available to group with.<br /><br />One of the most serious issues is the status of automated instance matching at this time.  In this game, parties of five are generated from a pool of available players across ALL servers, greatly increasing the availability of players compared to other MMOs.  Unfortunately, each party requires ONE player marked as a \""Tank\"", ONE player marked as a \""Healer\"", and THREE players marked as damage-dealers.  At this point, there are technically TWO Tank-type classes and TWO healer-type classes, but of the two tank-types, Lancer and Warrior, only the lancer can queue as a tank and since Lancers are quite short in supply across all servers the queue times for dungeons can be extensive outside of peak gameplay hours and it becomes a serious problem as the major quests of the game are tied to these instances.  It is a sort of gameplay hell for anyone that can't get into a big guild, so I recommend anyone that picks this game up to get into a guild and know their role if they want to have an enjoyable endgame experience.<br /><br />In addition to everything, TERA has not been marketed at all, so the playerbase remains fairly low, which exaggerates most of the above issues.<br /><br />Despite all of this, the combat is excellent.  The crafting system is fairly deep and labor intensive, which gives a feeling of accomplishment once you craft something you need after collecting the materials or working for the money to purchase them.  Throughout the game world are BAMs, boss monsters that have to be fought in a way similar to the game Monster Hunter and with around 15 unique BAM types both in instances and in the game world with increasingly more complex attack styles and risks, they are an absolute exhilarating experience to battle.  While transportation can be a bit bothersome from time to time, it is eased by teleport abilities throughout the game world to major quest hubs.  The story picks up late but is actually very good if you pay attention to quests and their flavor text.  There are a number of well-made cutscenes sprinkled throughout the current main story and the characterization of one of the later main villains is fantastic.<br /><br />All in all, the game is definitely worth a subscription if you're into action-based combat and MMOs, but hold off on more than a month until the above issues are fixed.  I know I wrote more about the bad than the good, but that's pretty much ALL the bad stuff there is!

Typical \""Sociopath Who Terrorizes Family without possible Legal Repercussions\"" formula is at play here. The writing is superb; at no point did I feel this novel get bogged down, and I have to give props to James Bell for that. The novel moves right along at a brisk pace with some twists here or there.  There is an odd Christian theme inserted throughout the story though (and NO, not odd as in I'm anti-Christianity). It seems like he was trying to add depth to the book by providing this philosophical component of how someone of faith deals with something like a sociopath, since a socipoath is deemed not savable.

The two families have also been living together under one roof in California and they go outside quite a bit to experience what it's like to be a member of another race.

Renee and Carmen go hiking (a first for Renee) and they try their best to make peace between them--will they be able to do that?

Of course, those who hold to the classic Sherlock Holmes will never agree and I can't fault them.  But for those who've never read the books and just want to see an action movie .....<br /><br />I enjoyed the plot and the choreographed fight scenes.  I enjoyed Holmes' character and Watson's character, their gypsy allies, and their love/hate relationship.  Prof. Moriarity makes a downright nasty villian, as does his sharpshooting assassin sidekick.  Holmes' nearly supernatural insight & foresight are a stretch, but still very enjoyable.  In a second he looks at a perilous situation (like a fight) and works out the next 10 moves, like a chess Grandmaster.  Watson, his \""Bishop\"", is likewise very enjoyable to watch in action.  There's elements of violence/action mixed in with intelligent scripting and even comedy.  (Like when the sharpshooter has Watson pinned down, but Watson finds a cannon to shoot back at him.  The sharpshooter mutters, \""that's not fair\"" as he scurries away.)  It has LOTS of Steampunk elements - Cool metallic gadgets and \""neat\"" WWI-era armaments, all enhanced by the director's stop-action super detail-oriented techniques and gritty photography.  (I loved the scene: \""let's introduce them to little Hansel,\"" ... a giant cannon!)  Makes you really think that you're watching turn-of-the-century Europe!  But action alone can't make a winning movie, and \""A Game of Shadows\"" delivers the intelligent plot to go along with the action.  Like Dr. Moriarity trying to start a war by using terrorism (predates WWI).  Like our heroes trying to figure out where the next terrorist act will be, or trying to analyze clues for which disguised man is going to shoot the Arch-duke.  It does engage your mind.<br /><br />Some reviewers didn't like the casting of Harris as Moriarity, but that's their totally subjective opinion.  Like which is better, Blue orRed?  I thought he was great (ie you hate him) without being the typical cliched Hollywood villian.<br /><br />Why doesn't it get 5 stars?  Because the director goes over-the-top (arrogance? assumes his fans don't care?) with stupid \""stuff.\""  For example Holmes' brother is hosting Watson's fiance at his home and he greets her in the morning stark naked. Very stupid and it would never happen in England in 1900!  Also for example the pseudo-gay stuff like making Holmes dress in drag, lie down half-naked during a firefight and tell Watson, \""Come lie down with me!\""  Just this little over-the-top irritating stuff that knocks it down from 5 to 4 stars.  Also, I'm sure that true Sherlock Holmes fans have never gotten over giving the gig to a very non-British-looking American actor (Robert Downey Jr.), despite his talent and ability to flawlessly speak with a British accent.  But if you've accepted Downey Jr. as Holmes by now, and you don't require adherence to the original Sherlock Holmes character & stories, then this movie is better than the first in my opinion.",2012-07-19,500,long,2012-07,videos

Having loved Port Royale 2, and spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours playing that game, I was super excited to find out that a Port Royale 3 was coming out.  I found out two days before it came out, and got 15% off by pre-ordering the game.  The first game I think I have ever pre-ordered.  Even at a discount, it's not worth the money.<br /><br />  Ever seen a video game get a face lift?  That's basically what this was.  Another old time favorite game of mine, Deadlock, by the now bankrupt and gone Accolade, did the same thing.  Produced a great game with Deadlock, and years later released Deadlock 2, which was identical to Deadlock 1, except for different menu colors, and re-done animations.  Nothing new was added, no new gameplay, no new missions, dont even think the music changed.  Very similar thing has happened here.  The company that made Port Royale 2 is bankrupt and gone, and this is more like a digitally remastered version of PR2 than an actual sequel to PR2.<br /><br />  Port Royale 3.  They did change the music.  The music is decent.  That may be the only compliment in here about this game.  The ships are the same, the towns are the same, the goods are the same.  Granted, there's a lot of things that wouldn't make sense if they changed, like the name and/or location of a town; and I'm not expecting sub-marines to be available at the shipyard alongside wooden sloops.  But... come on, if there is nothing new in the game, why am I buying it?  There were no additional ship designs that could be offered, or a way to customize ships, or smaller towns that could be added alongside the existing larger towns ?<br /><br />  PR2, you had 19 different commodities that you could trade.  PR3 has 20.  Of the 19 in PR2, 17 of them have made it back in PR3.  The interface for buying the goods is actually worse in PR3.  In PR2 you could click a button allowing you to buy items by 1s, 10s, or 100s.  In PR3, its a slider bar, slides by 1s up to 10, then by 2s, then by 5s.  Its very annoying, and very fickle to deal with.<br /><br />  So the goods and ships are the same, no big deal right?  The missions are the same too.  Hunt down this person for revenge, find my lost boy, rescue your missing wife.  IF you've played PR2, you've done all these missions a hundred times.  Maybe since I've done them a hundred times already, is why they have no appeal now.<br /><br />  Face Lift:  Most of the core items still exist exactly as they were in Port Royale 2.  It wouldn't surprise me if they used the same code, added new music, and enhanced the graphics.  The graphics 'OVERALL' are much better than in PR2. Let me emphasize that while I think overall they are better, its not better everywhere, ie. across the board.  In PR2, all of the important characters, wife, viceroy, governors, townspeople who would hire you, and the chronicler, all had animated video clips.  Video and Sound to tell you your mission, or ask your help.  In PR3, only the advisor gets video clips, everyone else is just a quick sound clip with a still picture.  The characters no longer tell you your mission either; they say \""I have an offer for you\"", and then you have to read the proposal.  The towns are beautiful High Def graphics, yet all the buildings are the same color, and hard to differentiate when you are in town.<br /><br />  Other things of note:  The overall interface of the game is worse.  The slider bar becomes real annoying real quick.  Transferring items and/or ships between convoys is more annoying and cumbersome than before.  Checking convoy status is harder to get to, and even with the campaign and multiplayer put in, It feels like more was taken out from PR2, than was put in to PR3;  why was the gambling card game at the Tavern removed?  why were the mission success videos taken out?<br /><br />Bottom Line:  I have a hard time giving this game 1 star, it seems really harsh.  Yet, 2 stars feelslike way more than it deserves.  I'm giving it 2 stars with the following advice.  Anyone who has played Port Royale 2, is going to be severely disappointed with this game.  Anyone who hasn't, you'd be better off saving some money and getting Port Royale 2, which you'll probably like better anyhow.",2012-05-30,780,extra_long,2012-05,games

The tech completely (and often literally) shapes the world of the story, in which sundries are not manufactured, they are compiled from a box in the kitchen. The amount of thought that went into world-building is a little mind-blowing. I spent days puzzling over the idea of airships that were filled with a vacuum. Moreover, since nano-machines and 3D printing are technologies that are emerging right now, this book felt prescient in ways that other cyberpunk stories don't for me.<br /><br />The primary protagonist is Nell, who is born in the opening chapters and is sixteen by the novel's conclusion. She inadvertently stumbles across a nanotech book called \""The Young Lady's Illustrated Primer\"" which sets her on a rags-to-riches story that feels almost... regency. In fact, a lot about this story feels like Jane Austen with nanobots. Other parts felt very much like Great Expectations. And still others felt like Ian Flemming--Stephenson prominently features a mafia don named \""Dr. X\"". Throwaway gags like that make me wonder how much the author is winking at his audience, but on the whole the humor supported the story and informed character. There were some easter-eggs for nerds like myself, one of the less-subtle being a subversive named Mr. PhyrePhox. A series of castle puzzles late in the book reminded me first of the OSI stack and then later of the progression of pre- and post-industrial technologies. But at the end of the day, Stephenson is using technology to demonstrate the power of our humanity, which is a very pleasant take on the genre.<br /><br />I will say that I found the ending unsatisfying. Without spoiling, an army arrives at the end, summoned by a signal that didn't have a very good reason to be there. And when it stops, it felt so abrupt that it might as well have been mid-sentence. I also had issues with the way the passage of time was conveyed, as well as a few traumatic incidents that were told so succinctly that I wasn't sure what I'd just read.<br /><br />But in the end the humor, the themes, and the world-building (I really can't overemphasize how thoughtfully constructed the world of the book is) won me over.",2012-03-04,413,long,2012-03,ebooks

Sadly, I am not moved to reviewing due to an experience with an amazing product, I am furious over a product that should never have been released for sale.<br /><br />I have been with Quicken since Quicken 2006.  I've been very happy and always felt that Quicken is a great product.  Quicken gave me a technological outlet for my meticulous financial record keeping.  In all the years I've been using the software, I've never had a problem with numbers except due to an error on my part.  Then I purchased Quicken 2013.  Tonight was the second time that I've had to revert to a backup copy of my data due to a sync with their \""cloud\"" service causing my numbers to change.<br /><br />To give you an idea of the terror that this instills within me (and you I hope), I watched as my checking account total changed by over $10.  This total changed after a sync only with the mobile service (I performed a sync with my financial institutions individually and separately from the mobile sync).  I looked at my screen dumbfounded with how I gained $10 when I made NO changes via the mobile app on my iPhone.  I looked through all of the cleared transactions, but I couldn't find anything that had changed.  I don't even use the app to enter transactions, all I wanted was a snapshot of the data from my desktop.  I work in Quicken everyday, so before I leave for the day I have all the latest data for my accounts and budgets on my desktop.  I take that data on my phone, use it as a guide during the day, then update it on my PC that evening.  Somehow, this resulted in a $10 discrepancy.  Also note that as I stated above, this is the second time this happened since I bought Quicken 2013 on 10/05/12.<br /><br />I have nothing to say regarding any other aspect of Quicken 2013.  I upgraded solely to have the mobile app and that is broken to the point of uselessness.  Just before starting this review, I went into Quicken and deleted my \""cloud\"" data.  I also deleted the app from my iPhone.  This \""feature\"" is a threat to your finances.  When I purchased the software, they were at Release 1.  In just a few weeks, they are up to Release 5.  I would venture a guess that we are in the QA phase of development.  Most businesses pay workers to perform QA on their software.  With Intuit, you pay them to QA their software.<br /><br />------ Update:  12/06/12 ------<br /><br />Mark and Christopher, I'm glad you both found the review useful.  Christopher, in response to your question about a replacement for Quicken, the first thought that came to my mind was \""Quicken 2011\"".  After thinking about it for a bit, I realize my decision was based on the feeling that 2011 gave me the most value for my money.  I purchased 2011 similar to 2013, very shortly after it was released.  I don't recall having any issues with the software.  Without going off on a tangent, I think the fair thing for me to do is to take into consideration the other aspects of the Quicken 2013 software.<br /><br />The budgeting aspect changed a bit from previous versions.  I'm still acclimating to that, but it seems more flexible and this could potentially be more useful to people.  Other than that aspect and the mobile features, just about everything in 2013 is functioning the same way the 2011 did.  This is a good thing in my mind, as I mentioned above I was very satisfied with Quicken 2011.<br /><br />Having made that statement, I think it's reasonable to say that if this is the first version of Quicken you are purchasing, then you are getting the same software from the previous versions and that is good.  If you are upgrading for the cloud features, my advice is to hold off a little while longer on that.  On 11/30 another patch was released which noted a few more fixes for some bugs in the Quicken Cloud aspect of the software.  I still don't think that feature is ready for prime-time.<br /><br />As for an alternative software package, perhaps something that is very \""cloud ready\"", you could take a look at mint.com.  I've never used it personally but I've seen several blogs rave about it.  I've never felt the desire to go to mint as I believed that the features would be available in Quicken before long.  Mint is owned by Intuit, so that proves Intuit is familiar with and capable of doing cloud based money management well.  My hope is that any more steps that Intuit takes in the direction of the cloud will be a bit more refined prior to releasing to the public.<br /><br />I've also decided to increase my rating to two stars.  Should the mobile feature reach bullet-proof levels, I'll increase my rating to three stars.  As it stands, I still don't see where I've gotten my money's worth out of the $60 upgrade and based on the hassles with the bugs in the mobile feature, I don't see any way that Quicken 2013 could attain higher than 3 stars in my mind.",2012-10-20,890,extra_long,2012-10,software

I couldn't shake the feeling that it was sort of an [[ASIN:B007RG9LMS Outlaw Josey Wales]] set in 16th century England.  The acting is great and the effects are purposeful and don't overwhelm.  If you are a fan of the genre and the character, you should be pleased.<br /><br />The story isn't complex and the revelations are pretty easy to figure out ahead of time.  The action is exciting and well choreographed. The film's 1 hour and 44 minutes moves at a good pace.<br /><br />My primary concern I have with many movies involving a fictional action hero is Hollywood's need to tell the origin of the character.  As with the recent Conan movie (and also Arnold's version) the filmmakers chose to develop an intricate origin story and then base the rest of the film on it. The flaw with this plan is: A) For Conan and Solomon Kane, there really were never any origin stories in Robert E. Howard's source material that were any more than hinted at, thus the film almost immediately moves out of canon and B) As with Spider-man, Batman, Superman etc., everybody on the planet Earth already knows the origin story; certainly nearly anyone who would want to see the film.<br /><br />In all of S&S there is no character that is quite like REH's Solomon Kane.  He is written as a dour, sojourner with the single minded goal of vanquishing evil, but perhaps his most notable characteristic is his ghostly white complexion and icy cold eyes.  The film makes occasional, brief pokes at the possibility of this characteristic developing, but in the end he is a character who looks like any other.  With the exception of his notable fighting skill, he is almost indistinguishable from any other man.<br /><br />While I thoroughly enjoyed this film, I long for the day when a film is made which presents a version of the character which is recognizable from the stories and he is just dropped into an adventure without any bother explaining why.  It worked for Indiana Jones in [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Raiders of the Lost Ark]].

I completed both the forms with the paperwork I had on hand as I knew I had a complicated tax year and wanted to get a rough estimate on where I stood. Later I got more paperwork which made a big difference in that amount of tax owed, and when I keyed it into H&R Block the Federal tax owed changed but the state didn't. No matter what I did I couldn;t figure out what to do and finally called customer support - who told me there is NO WAY to modify the state tax if the federal one is modified, and therefore not to start the state return until the federal one is totally 100% completed to every iota. And if there are any changes the only way to get the changes reflected on the state return is to *** DELETE EVERYTHING AND START OVER AGAIN FROM SCRATCH. ***<br /><br />I was totally unhappy with that answer, but decided to try a different product, and had heard good things about TaxAct, so went with that. For Federal and State it worked well. You could start both of them at the same time. Changes and updates made to the Federal form were instantly reflected on the state form. I was really happy with that part.<br /><br />I'm not TOTALLY stupid and I have a degree in Finance, but the tax code is confusing to just about everyone. and the biggest issue I had with TaxAct was that they didn't seem to make any effort to make it easier to fill in the forms - they just sort of plopped out very confusing stuff and asked you for details that I had trouble making heads or tails of. Time and time again I actually kept going back to the despised H&R Block software to review the same area - say Deductions or Capital Gains - as they made it so much more user-friendly and easy to understand. TaxAct worked much better with a joint Federal/State side-by-side, but H&R Block was WAY easier to understand and fill out.<br /><br />So I give it 4 stars because it did get the job done for me, and the price was right.

They have little to no credentials.<br /><br />That being said, the show's fun most of the time, and frustrating sometimes, and sometimes it manages to be both simultaneously. For instance, how come everytime they have a nighttime hunt in the woods or nighttime stakeout for a ghost in a haunted environment they get results the first night? They always seem to be at the right place at the right time. Although if you didn't have these dramatized events the show would be less cheesy fun.<br />In closing, take this show as nothing more than entertainment, and hey, they don't sensationalize everything, they disprove something every episode.

The problem isn't the acting. It is first-rate. Unfortunately, so many other reviewers are right: too many shortcuts taken with the plot in order to condense it. Oldman, etal are all amazing, but if you are a fan of the book, it can hurt to watch how characters have been altered to fit modern movie sensibilities and a timeframe.<br /><br />This I think is the crux of the movie's problem. If you love the book, or the Guinness series, you will keep up with the condensed plot. However, the compromises may make you wince. If you have never partaken of either, then of course you will have a hard time keeping up and/or understanding. I admire the effort and the quality of acting and filming. It is superbly done. Gary Oldman does more just with his facial expressions than most actors can portray using their entire toolbox.<br /><br />I do, however, have no sympathy for folks who think James Bond is what a British spy drama should be all about. The British excel at character development. You either love British drama or you hate it. This is not a value judgment if you don't. However, please accept you may simply be out of your league passing judgment on a milieu you neither appreciate nor enjoy. The majority of movies made will appeal to you, so you should have little to complain about. For those that appreciate enjoyment for its own sake, as well as subtle craftsmanship, this movie will probably appeal to you.

On my web pages I normally use font sizes of 11, 12 & 14 as these look good on 1920x1080 res screens, whilst not being too big on the smaller ones.<br />* Use simple text fonts for main texts, most popular are; Microsoft Sans Serif, Arial, Verdana, Comic Sans MS & Tahoma, this is to ensure people can clearly read your website.<br /><br />There have been some small issue's I have came across whilst building my website, however they are normally things you can easily resolve; one being is when embedding YouTube videos, you use the `Designs gallery' tab followed by `Page Elements' - `Audio/Video (widgets) - drag the `YouTube' widget onto your page, once done you need to find the video you want and click on \""share\"" then \""embed\"", you will then be provided with an HTML code which you need to highlight & copy before clicking \""insert\"".  The problem is once it's on your page, you can't resize it to a smaller size without it cutting video and when you make it \""bigger\"", it actually stays the same size by the width and height stated when embedding it, so the best way is to adjust the size in the html code before copying and inserting it.<br /><br />The main problem I had ran into was when optimizing images(a very important option to keep your website at low memory usage), it would turn transparent `.png' files background into a solid white, I had reported this to the support team and the next update that came out resolved this issue, this shows that Xara's software team are updating issues and are gradually ironing out the small bugs that exist.<br /><br />Uploading your website is super easy, first you will need to \""Export website\"" before publishing, once done go to \""Publish website\"" and type in your FTP host address, username & password, it's really that easy! #NOTE: The FTP address can be found(if using the Magix hosting site) by going to the control centre.<br /><br />Overall it's a great web designer package and would recommend it!es background into a solid white, I had reported this to the support team and the next update that came out resolved this issue, this shows that Xara's software team are updating issues and are gradually ironing out the small bugs that exist.<br /><br />Uploading your website is super easy, first you will need to \""Export website\"" before publishing, once done go to \""Publish website\"" and type in your FTP host address, username & password, it's really that easy! #NOTE: The FTP address can be found(if using the Magix hosting site) by going to the control centre.<br /><br />Overall it's a great web designer package and would recommend it!",2012-06-29,929,extra_long,2012-06,software

I really enjoyed Hybrid Theory and Meteora, and when I pressed \""Play\"" on my media player and heard \""Given Up\"", I thought that this was gonna be another nu-metal hit, with that gnarly 18-second scream. Then came \""Leave Out All The Rest\"". I'll be honest; it wasn't really what I was expecting, but I really enjoyed the song, regardless of its softness. \""Bleed It Out\"" was next on the list, and I really liked that, as well; Mike's rap, the chord progression on guitar, things like that. It had a lot of good aspects about it, plus it still stuck to that metal element we all know and love, as did \""No More Sorrow\"".<br /><br />To prevent you from having to read a wall of text, I'll just say my opinions on the softer songs; \""Shadow of the Day\"", \""In Pieces\"", and (\""soft\"" used loosely in this case), \""Valentine's Day\"" are all tracks that get hated on a lot and really don't deserve it, along with \""Hands Held High\"". I think the problem with the people that hate the album is like what happens to a lot of bands; they change their styles to fit in with the modern trends so they'll still stay at the stature they're at, or just because they'll get tired of having to listen to songs focused around angst and pent-up aggression. I think Dave Farrell, their bass player, said that in an interview once.<br /><br />I may be speaking for just myself (but unlikely), though, when I say that \""Little Things Give You Away\"" is probably the best song on the album. I think it may be the first song I've heard by them that even has a little dash of romantic to it. It still has that 'dark' feeling, with the narrator recognizing that they're about to drown six feet underwater, but he's realizing that the person that he needed was right there beside him, wanting desperately to be looked up to. It is indeed a fantastic song, and probably my favorite out of them all. I recommend this album, falling just short of greatness.orite out of them all.

This film is so full of inaccuracies and outright lies it actually made me mad.<br /><br />Bonnie and Clyde are such a fascinating pair and their true story is gripping and simply amazing. I read quite a few reviews before adding mine. There are quite a few people who say they were scum and trash. You have to take everything into account. They lived in the great depression where there was no money, and hard times. Shanty towns dotted every state because people were evicted from their homes. It was a bad time to be alive.(Nearly 1 out of every 4 citizens were unemployed) Times were ridiculously rough for the people of the Great Depression era.<br /><br />Clyde was a small time crook in his youth (Doing what his brothers and friends in their ghetto did to make money). He was sent to jail and back then (and even to some extent today) ex cons were hounded at all times by the law. You couldn't walk down the street with out being stopped by police. After Clyde got out of jail he got an honest job. Why didn't he stick with it? Because he was taken from his place of employment anytime the cops got a wild hair up their butts. It resulted in him being fired.He went back to what he knew. His attitude was most likely one of \""They expect me to anyway...they are always harassing me about things I didn't do so screw it why not just go ahead and do it\""<br /><br />Clyde was then sent to one of THE WORST prisons in Texas (And some say the US) He was brutalized and raped there.(this is where he committed his first murder...he killed the man who raped him)Prisoners were beaten by each other and the people who were supposed to guard them. (After an investigation of the prison, the warden was forced to resign) Clyde went so far as to cut off his own toes to try and get out of that place. These factors persuaded him to raid the prison later on and do his best to liberate as many prisoners as possible. Given his time in Eastham prison he swore never to go back.<br /><br />These kids gave up their lives. They lived in camp sites and cabins and ran. They slept outside and survived the best they could because they knew there was no going back for either of them.  When ever possible Clyde kidnapped police men rather than out and out killing them. He played the game till the end. Bonnie loved him more than life itself and was willing to roll the dice of fate to stay with him as long as possible.<br /><br />They were a fascinating pair. The movie is not one that depicts them with any sense of accuracy.

I was, however, disappointed. I'm not sure exactly if it's any one thing over the other, more so than a combination of things, but I really just could not connect with this story. I found the characters to be superficial, shallow, wishy-washy, arrogant and the execution of the plot was weak at best. I haven't read the first two books in the series, and I didn't feel as though I was missing any information when reading it, it did indeed stand alone, but I just couldn't connect.    The Blurb:    Though she's always hated being a phoenix, Sadie has to admit immortality has its advantages. She's seen and done more in the last 150 years than she'd ever dreamed of, but she can't get past the fact that Osiris has done nothing but manipulate her and her fellow phoenixes.    Or that, when her last incarnation as a phoenix comes to a fiery end, the fire slowly begins to consume her body.    Sun god Osiris is ashamed of his role as ruler of the Underworld, but unless he can figure out how to save Sadie, that's exactly where she's going to end up. Permanently. Terrified he's going to lose her, he takes her on a hunt for The Book of the Dead, which is the only way he knows he can save her-even if it means she'll hate him forever.    My Take:    I found Osiris to be selfish and arrogant, which in the beginning of a story is fine, the problem was right up to the very end he continued to be selfish and arrogant, even as he 's trying to save Sadie's life, I don't get the feeling he's doing it for her, but for him which takes away all the romance in the gesture of trying to save Sadie.    I found Sadie herself to be shallow and wishy-washy, I want him, I don't want him, flirting and then don't even think about it. It was like she was two different people and it was became annoying.    Frankly, for Osiris to be an Egyptian God, he didn't come across as godly, in addition to his selfishness (which, okay that's a bit typical of gods,) and arrogance, his obsession with Sadie was a bit too much to handle as though he was a puppy. He didn't come across as manly or alpha to me, as a God should in my opinion, especially one such as Osiris. Obsession isn't sexy, it's creepy.    The sexual chemistry for the two was non-existent though the author did try, and I think for the most part it was due to the characterization of the hero and heroine. I felt like it was just thrown in there for the sake of it. Most of the time I felt like Sadie really truly did not like Osiris which is why I felt like the sex and sexual tension was just thrown in.    I felt like I was floating above the story rather than being a part of it. As I said earlier, I just didn't connect. I really really wanted to like this story, which is why I finished it. I was hoping by the end that everything would fix itself, but sadly it didn't.    The story is on the shorter side, around 100 pages or so and perhaps this is one of the reasons I didn't connect, there was just too much plot and history between the characters to fit into just 100 pages. I felt that I was being told most of the history of Osiris and Sadie's relationship rather than getting to see it develop. This story, had it been executed better, could have been great. Sadly, it wasn't.    My Rating: 2/5 lattes",2012-02-29,686,extra_long,2012-02,ebooks

The beginning is what draws you in and gets you interested; it's your first impression, and as such it will leave a lasting impression.  If you can get past the beginning, the most important part is the ending.  This is what determines how you will look back on it, and for any story-based experience it is the sum total of your experience, the result of your efforts.  The beginning of Mass Effect 3 was a hassle because of origin; once you get into the game it's fine, but it's a pain to get started and should be noted that you cannot do so without an internet connection even if you buy a hard copy.  (I just happened to have no internet for the first week the game came out, so I spent a week with a single player game I couldn't start)<br /><br />The ending, on the other hand, is poor by design.  There are literally dozens of examples of the developers stating that your decisions throughout the course of the three games will determine your individual ending; some quotes even go so far as to say that you are creating your own narrative through your decisions.  However, no matter what you do, you get the same ending with slight differences in color.  For most game this would not be a big issue, but Mass Effect is a trilogy based on the idea of creating your own story through your decisions.  Further, even as an individual ending it is poor and has numerous plot holes because they try and cram all these decisions that alter the galaxy and its inhabitants into one all-encompassing conclusion.  The result is that the ending will leave you disappointed, if not angry.<br /><br />Now, why make such a big deal of an ending?  Simply because this is the final summary of your efforts.  This is what you will think of when you look back at the potentially hundreds of hours of time you put into this series.  It is generally understood that when you invest a large amount of time and effort in a game and eventually accomplish everything, you win.

How it eeked out six more seasons is beyond me, maybe everyone kept watching to see if it would get better.<br /><br />Now that isn't to say the first two seasons didn't have their problems but they were interesting and well written enough to assume it would get better.<br /><br />The problems on this show stems from how unbelievable it is, some of the situations the Nancy character is put in and how she gets out of them stops being realistic sometime in season 1.  It doesn't make sense that experience people would follow a novice in the world of drug dealing.  It's more of a lead character role/hollywood thing and it kills the show.  Real criminals pounce on females trying to walk the darkside unless they prove to be a force to be reckoned with, \""nancy's\"" force is the writers.  The character just does whatever she wants and suffers no real consequences, she would have attracted attention from people she couldn't handle.  Basically in the real world she would have been dead or turning tricks real after(or before) getting in debt to uturn.  Being 150k in debt doesn't make you a personal assistant, it did on the show but really, he would have had her dancing in clubs and servicing people on top of selling drugs to make his money back.  I'm sure the star didn't want the character portrayed that way but that's what really would happen.<br /><br />They show some truth in this with how she dealt with the small time pot dealer but the follow up of her brushing him off after is bull.  He would have dictated her terms not the other way around. Her sleeping with him one time then he's working for her, I don't think so.  He wouldn't have been trying to romance her, he would have tried breaking her and pimping her off.  They say art mirrors life and that's the issue here, it should, even i it's one of those gaint wavy funhouse mirrors.<br /><br />I also question Conrad leaving her in there with uturn, I don't see that happening, it betrays the character.  I think it was just a way to break the onscreen chemistry between the two and so fans would grow to dislike him.  I saw him walking out with her out of the grow house and then cutting ties for good after they got some distance away from uturn.  They still could of had uturn pop in and control her after finding out the truth, it would have made a lot more sense that way. The writer apparently like the ida of her hooking up with mexicans more and that's fine, just don't portray the Conrad character as eating out of her hand.  He would have moved on, period.  I guess that's what they were trying to accomplish but they went about it all wrong.<br /><br />After that the show pretty much falls off the tracks, it remains a bit entertaining and you hope it improve but it just gets worst and worst.  I really hated how the cecilia character devolved into a punching/abuse bag.  I just don't see it especially given the jail time even if she was someone else's plaything in the story it should have harden her.  Not make her all weepy and willing to accept abuse, she never reached her breaking point and should have instead of just being comic relief.<br /><br />To sum it up it's like friday meets desperate housewives and after they gains some popularity they ditch the African american actors(who made it funny) and apparently the good writers as the show starts going downhill during and after the 3rd season.  The guy playing andy does ok but he worked best with the Dean character and the two never got enough screen time together.  The coyote thing should have went to the forefront and the Nancy character's storyline should have taken a backseat.  It wasn't entertaining.  She get's old really quick, they try to angle her as a manipulator but in the underworld she would have been used abused and tossed aside.  You can't write a show about \""empowered\"" woman when she has no power base, noangle...absolutely nothing to leverage.<br /><br />Watch the first two seasons and maybe the third but trust me it's not worth it after that, it becomes a waste of time.<br /><br />I really hope all the suburban kids watching this aren't influenced by what they see, it never ends like the movies.  It's always worst.",2012-09-13,776,extra_long,2012-09,videos

Possibly because so many well-intentioned romantic comedies turn into dismal, badly written mush.<br /><br />My mistake, because \""Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day\"" turned out to be crisp and charming. Set in London on the Eve of WWII, it resembles a \""gold-digging\"" depression-era comedy with Amy Adams cast as the sparkling starlet who can't decide between the man with money, the man who can promote her career, and the handsome pianist (Lee Pace) who loves her.<br /><br />Into this madcap life slips Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormand) - a Vicar's daughter/governess who's literally starving on the streets because she believes children ought to behave. The two women strike up a friendship that -- through the course of fun (if predictable) twists and turns -- transforms each of them for the better.<br /><br />If there's a fault with \""Miss Pettigrew,\"" it's the romantic subplot.

I don't know much more about his character and the subject of this film, Hart Crane, than before I watched it.  James Franco is a good actor, but he needs a lot of help as a screenwriter and director in my opinion.  I've seen a couple of his other short films and they are all mediocre at best.  There is no real narrative for the story, very little dialogue to explain much of anything.  The few moments that there is any story exposition through dialogue and conversations with other characters are the best scenes of the film, I wish there was much more of that. Perhaps there could have been scenes of discussions with other writers or artists about the nature of art or the need to write, to express oneself and interpret the meaning of life and experience.  Instead what much of the film is is James Franco emoting silently while walking aimlessly for long periods in various cities around the world or while sitting in front of a typewriter and staring at a blank page.  We know he's depressed and suicidal, but little is explained about Hart Crane's relationships with various male lovers or his family.  Gay men in the 1920's and 30's were invisible in society and kept very low profiles and were limited to clandestine meetings behind closed doors.  I'm sure that was a very lonely way to live and the film hints at this as one of the reasons for Hart's incredible loneliness and sadness, but since we never get a real conversation between any of his lovers, we are left with a couple of sex scenes and don't know who any of these men passing through Hart's life are.  Watching the film feels more like watching a painting at a museum while wearing a headset listening to Hart Crane's poetry with a single character for 80% of it.  A much superior movie about writers is HOWL also starring James Franco as Allen Ginsberg and the famous poem he wrote.  There is so much more emotion and life in that movie than in Broken Tower, which just feels lifeless and void of emotion to me.  In HOWL during James Franco's reading of the poem throughout the filmmakers did something genius which was to use animated imagery to interpret the poem, which really brought it to life for me and helped me to understand what Ginsberg was trying to express.  In Broken Tower, we just see James Franco reciting in a flat monotone void of any emotion Hart Crane's poetry and it's difficult to understand much of it.

As readers, we spent two books getting to know Daven and being in his head.  We saw him come to his full power and potential.  All of this happens at the end of book two so when you pick up book three, you think the story will continue.  It doesn't.  Not the one the readers were hoping for anyway.  It doesn't matter that Pogue will fill in those 15 years later at some other point.  As readers and fans, we wanted Daven's story now.  The story of his son could have been saved for another day.  However, even considering what Pogue was attempting to do, I feel the biggest error was in how Daven was portrayed in this story.  Two books we've spent in his head, fighting.  Whether it was evil men, dragons, or his power, Daven fought.  Then, in book three, the fighter is dead, and a pathetic weak madman stands in his stead.  This is such an injustice to the character of Daven.  I know it's not my story, that the author can do whatever he likes.  But when we read these books, the characters DO become ours in a way.  So when the hero we know and love is brushed aside as almost an afterthought, it's just wrong.  I could go on, but I think I've said my peace.  The only other complaint I had was that Daven's two main human enemies, once again, are allowed to live.  That's just BS.  How much wrong must be done before they are put down.  I get keeping the king alive, but the wizard and the hound serve no purpose other than to add \""superhero\"" drama.  \""Oh the same bad guys are at it again!\"" (comics have been doing the same thing for years; keep the villains alive so new ones don't have to be created) Meanwhile, everyone's wondering why they weren't dealt with long before.

First, I'm reviewing the .mp3 album, and while any .mp3 recording can sound a little hazy on a good stereo, it's very noticeable on this one. Either the compression went badly, or she just wasn't recorded that well. Her voice has a ton of detail, rich overtones, fascinating little quirks, and this album makes a blur out of some of it. (Whatever went wrong, it shows up in the violins as well, at points.) I realize no one is looking for audiophile quality in a pop album, but her voice was worth better treatment. If you care about detail, consider the CD, at least you won't have the .mp3 compression to deal with.<br /><br />Second... it's a pop album, and like too much pop, it's drowning in ornamentation and embellishments and plain old syrupy over-production. Here you've got someone with a powerful, idiosyncratic, rich, at points smoky voice that's just plain fun to listen to, and doesn't need any help... and someone decided it needed to be backed by violin trills (Thinking Over, Maybe). It didn't. Find a video of just her and a piano and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Positives? Great, great voice, fun composition, emotion, power and control to spare. Standouts are Almost Had It All and Thinking Over, and I like The Way.<br /><br />So where has she been for ten years? Here's a natural performer, gorgeous voice, talented composer, someone who can kick a song into a high emotional gear, not to mention being easy on the eyes - she should have been a queen of the live concert scene, and someone who could have given Norah Jones a run for her money.

I like her as a companion to Mort but the way she drives the plot in the first book by keeping her plans hidden drove me crazy! In general, the way lack of communication was used to drive the plot in the first book was painful to read, sope opera dramma doesn't belong in fantasy. Similarly, the way Penny got all puffy and left after her vision in the second book was totally unrealistic and over dramatic. I just read that part in fact and had to stop reading so I could rant about it. In general the problem with the authors writing is that the characters are too one dimensional. Penny is a fiery wife, Rose is clever and kind noble, Devon is evil, and Derion (or what ever his name is) is a true friend. It makes it easy to determine their actions for both the reader and writer and makes dialogs dull.  I look forward to the development of this author.

US,12282618,R392Y9YBYR2UHZ,B004Q8JMD8,202414312,Along with the tide,Digital_Music_Purchase,3,0,0,False,False,Ginger Trees: Along With the Tide (2011),"Swedish band GINGER TREES was formed back in 2006 or thereabouts, and issued their debut album in 2008 in the shape of \""Came the Morning\"". Following this production the band signed with Swedish label Transubstans Records, who released their second disc \""Along With the Tide\"" in February 2011. A few months after the band went into hiatus however, a state they are still in at the time of writing.<br /><br />Artists associated with Transubstans Records tends to be of the kind commonly described as retro-oriented rock, most often inspired by acts such as Black Sabbath, Mountain, The Doors and Jethro Tull. Vintage hard rock, frequently sporting a few bells and whistles. From the sound they explore this time around, it would appear that Ginger Trees is at least slightly an exception as far as that description goes. Yes they do have the odd compositions sporting a riff halfway borrowed from Tony Iommis repertoire, but on this occasion this element isn't a defining aspect of their chosen style, nor is it dominant in any manner whatsoever. Indeed, by and large the few creations of this ilk are among the least interesting.<br /><br />Where this band and this disc are at their most interesting, it is when exploring the gentler, delicate landscapes. Relatively speaking however, as sticksman Johan opts for a hectic and energetic display throughout, often with what I'd think of as a slightly jazz-oriented style. In a subtle manner that is. But the bass and guitar have more of a laidback style, slow-paced for the former, light in tone and slightly fragmented for the latter. Serving as a carefully crafted foundation for the powerful pipes of Rasmus. He's got a strong voice, able to handle the delicate, dampened moments with the same ease as the emotionally laden and powerful ones, and his input alongside the relatively careful stylistic expression explored often made me associate this act with now defunct Norwegian band Madrugada. In particular the sound that band pursued on their initial effort \""Industrial Silence\"".<br /><br />Ginger Trees does venture in more of an alternate universe to that band though, as their sound has more of a distinct blues tinge, while the chorus sections tends to stretch towards 70's hard rock to a greater degree with the powerful guitar and organ blend commonly utilized for those passages. Alongside a more distinct and powerful lead vocal. An additional trait for Ginger Trees is the inclusion of subtle details with more of a folk rock origin, and in the case of final track Kurukshetra ones with more of a psychedelic character to them are inserted as well.<br /><br />\""Along With the Tide\"" is a CD with a curious blend of gentle rock of the timeless variety and harder edged 70's art rock details, with occasional inclusions of vintage stoner rock elements. By and large a pleasant creation, where the most intriguing creations tends to be the ones exploring the calmer sides of their repertoire. Strong lead vocals manage to make these ever so slightly more interesting than what one might expect, while the careful instrumental foundation often manage to add in some nice and slightly unexpected details. As far as recommendations go, I'd think that quite a few of those who like Madrugada's debut album would find this album to be of interest too. This due to the similarities in approach and overall dynamics, even if the stylistic expression as such has it's fair share of differences.",2012-03-07,575,extra_long,2012-03,music

US,31584509,R1UF7I2IWL1HQ1,B007V9YF5E,54610846,Haywire,Digital_Video_Download,3,1,3,False,True,Movie Review Haywire (2011) main: Gina Carano,"Okay, okay I admit I did a bad thing by missing this movie when it was in theaters. I've watched Gina Carano in many Mixed Martial Arts events and always thought she would translate well in a movie as a kick-ass agent of destruction. We were teased by her cameo appearance in 2009's B-classic Blood and Bone as a street fighter. Tell me when she gave Isaiah Bone (main: Michael Jai White) her number- you weren't hoping she'd be seen again.<br /><br />And so, when a trailer emerges that shows Gina Carano doing the CIA-MMA combat style, you have to get amped. The trailer also showed Michael Douglas so you felt that the good acting was going to be handled by an able veteran. Add Ewan McGregor and Antonio Banderas and you have a can't-miss bundle. Well it has just arrived on rental and DVD so now I'm getting my chance to see Gina in action.<br /><br />Plot Ploddings<br /><br />At about the 36 minute mark I realized I had no idea what was going on, why and who any of the characters were. I had to check myself to see if I had checked out and stopped paying attention and missed some clues. No, it's one of those movies where they leave it blurry and bring it into focus at the very end, which doesn't quite make sense since the overall plot is as simple as it seemed in the trailer: super agent is double-crossed and sets out on a mission to find out why and at the same time - seek revenge. It doesn't work to keep us in the dark about something we already knew walking in.<br /><br />Cut to the chase<br />Let's get to the action and choreography since that's supposed to be the meat of this flick.  In true fanboy service, you will get to see Gina Carano as freelance agent Mallory Kane pull off several bread and butter MMA moves- including the triangle, Muay Thai leg kicks and the superman punch. The only problem is; all the best moments are pretty much shown in the trailers. The early scenes are well edited and frenetic enough to warrant the name haywire, but later they begin to feel like set ups. It's as if the director looked at the clock and figured it was time for a mini-fight scene and placed the characters in, oh just enough peril to have a quick fight. By the time the climatic confrontation (Which you won't know is going down until the credits roll) occurs you'll be hoping you can see something different. Unfortunately the action plays out the same as the first fight and only the quick jump-cuts make the fight seem any different.<br /><br />Sometimes it feels like I've slipped from watching an action movie to watching an action reel meant to prove Gina Carano is a great action-hero fit. We have long shots of her running (for almost no damn reason), which proves she can run and look cool [like James Bond] and we have her in several outfits showing off her curves. She is also allowed to play it sexy, aloof and cool in a few quiet moments. Her action-acting resume is accepted. In much the same style as Hanna (2011 main: Saoirse Ronan) there are several scenes set to music as if we are watching a music video. And that's another bothersome point. It feels as if director Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Eleven, Traffic, Erin Brockovich and Solaris +) was more concerned with getting a cool shot and placing the camera in an interesting place than following any kind of logical course of action for our heroine to take. To his credit, he may be a saving factor because removing those cool camera angles might have left some scenes looking very boring and plain. I mean, she's jumping over roof tops, but with no real sense of danger and no discernable reason to be doing so. She's not exactly trapped and the pursuing baddies aren't even sure where she is. So what's she doing besides looking awesome?<br /><br />In the end, I feel the whole is not equal to the sum of its parts. You have many underutilized, bankable actors, a great physical actress and a plot as simple as it gets. Sure there are scenes with creative camera work. Sure there are moments when MMA-lovers can cheer at the screen and call out the techniques being used, but overall this movie represents a first step in what I hope is the budding film career of Gina Carano. I can easily see her as a Bond villainess or arch nemesis in the next Charlie's Angels. Although our heroine says early in the film that she doesn't like loose ends, this movie leaves us with a lot of loose ends. Hopefully, action superstar Gina Carano gets a chance to tie them up in her next movie role. Worth renting, not owning.

I thought The Hours was genius, even enjoyed his rough first stab at writing with A Home at the End of the World, but my all-time favorite was Flesh and Blood.<br /><br />Unfortunately, By Nightfall was missing the essential connection to the characters that made those books so great. Peter is vapid and self-obsessed. He's a wealthy, white man living in New York City and finding his pampered life just slightly underwhelming. I found myself hoping some huge catastrophe would befall him - not because I need fiction to be dramatic, but because he is so extremely privileged it would take an enormous tragedy to bring him down to earth, make him relatable.<br /><br />The book is narrated by Peter- sometimes in third person, sometimes in second or first. The reader is in his head as he talks to himself about every mundane and superficial thing under the sun. He's an art dealer, frustrated because he has yet to find an artist with real genius, someone that truly moves him and gives meaning to his life. When his wife's much younger brother comes to stay with them, Peter views him as a mixture of his wife when she was in her twenties and his brother who died in his twenties. This leads Peter to question his sexuality and consider running away from his marriage, his job, and his life in New York.<br /><br />Of course, Peter isn't really in love with his brother-in-law; he just wants to break free of his life.<br /><br />The little twist at the end was almost redeeming. Almost. This might have worked as a short story, trimming out the three-page description of an urn, the play-by-play of a dull work day, his constant self-conscious musings.

The song was released in February 2012 to mixed reviews, with critics saying the song's lyrics were great but the production was weak (I agree with them on that). This song is not bad, but the production just really intrigues me, it's not appealing and sounds very weak and basic like Avril's 'What The Hell' (that song was terrible precisely because of its production). It's even worse when Madonna says 'every record sounds the same' when this record really sounds like other stuff out there. Even 'Girl Gone Wild' (that is also a weak song) could have been a better first single. This story continues on the song 'Girl Gone Wild', but now I'll say this song is weak and Madonna was very lucky it was a top 10 hit like most of her lead singles, but if she didn't promote at Superbowl probably it would have flopped harder than the following single.",2012-05-13,223,long,2012-05,music

Now returning home to her fianc&eacute; Andrew whom she had not seen or spoken to in over a year, to plan their wedding. But Darius the younger son of sir Gregory has returned home as well, something Chloe is not happy about. Darius is the black sheep of the family, and all the village knows his reputation is well earned.<br />First off I have to say this story had a real dated feel to it, the whole atmosphere of the village and it's inhabitants were of a bygone era. The author tries to lend an air of mystery to the story to stop that feeling of predictability,but it just ends up being bogged down with detail. The heroine who seemed to me to be either stupid, arrogant or both really irritated me. She had not seen or spoken to her fianc&eacute; for a year, she had been studying her career, what as a housekeeper really! She then swans home expecting to start planning a wedding to a man who is obviously reluctant to be alone with her and she wonders why.

This album is what happens when an underground movement leaves the basements and dirty dives and sees the light of day. Big industry grabs hold of the 'new thing' and exploits the hell out of it in order to make big bucks - in the process watering it down and polishing it until it's no longer recognizable as what it originally started from.

They don't know what that purpose is, just that it is their job to live for it. All of his shaven brothers look eerily alike. There is a reason for that.

Is he a creation of man or the divine Creator? Is it not true that everything we know or will know is God's and if that is the case, isn't it logical to think it is possible that if God wanted to, He could grant a soul?<br /><br />I really enjoyed stepping into what if with Jill Williamson.

It seems to be a winner and deserves theatrical release.<br /><br />The plot is best described by the package insert: 'The Runway is inspired by the true story of a South American pilot Ernesto (Demi&aacute;n Bichir) who landed his plane near Mallow, in 1983. Against all odds, the people of the town came together to build a runway to get him home and briefly caught the imagination of the nation. It is the story of Paco (Jamie Kierans), a young boy without a father who adopts the pilot and convinces the town to build a runway to get him home.' It was written and directed by Ian Power and seems to let us see the story as through a child's eyes. There is small town camaraderie, some love interest, and a lot of the joy of being able to try to make the world (or at least a corner of it) a better place. Bruno Bechir (Demi&aacute;n's brother), Kerry Condon, Nilton Martins, James Cosmo, Pat Laffan, Mark Doherty, David Pearse and Claire Johnston are the supporting cast. This is a warm, well acted, humorous and touching little film that once again shows Demi&aacute;n Bichir's gifts as an actor. He is able to make the film sing - with the obbligato of Jamie Kierans adding immensely to the show. Grady Harp, July 12",2012-07-23,248,long,2012-07,videos

However, Quicken makes it impossible for customers to keep a version for more than 3 years and you HAVE to buy an update after 3 yrs are up -- the ugly side of capitalism. It would not be so annoying if the updates offered significant improvements, but they do not.  Having bought the Quicken 2012 deluxe edition, the download and updating of files worked easily and quickly. I think the 2012 edition is noticeably faster than the 2009.  However, there are errors and bugs.  I noticed that the new Planning-Budget report/graph had errors...  1) For example, the salary/income section for January shows a red number with the \""under\"" tag, indicating a deficiency. However, I get paid on the 31st, as most people do, and Quicken cannot handle this. I guess I have 3 more years of being underpaid for everyday in the month except one!  2) Another example is that payments made TO my loan accounts show up as withdrawals in the Planning/Budgets report/graph. So, according to this summary, which is supposed to keep me up to date on how I am doing, my loans are getting LARGER with every payment I make to them!  I have carried out several hours of online \""chatting\"" to try to resolve these, but I began to feel that they were using me to test their product, because they asked me to generate new files and then \""try this...\"" or import all my financial stuff from my bank and \""try that...\"" and so on. I gave up and sent them some e-mails describing the problem. I went to their website, thinking that perhaps i was doing something wrong, and there were SEVERAL HUNDRED postings from customers who were having the same issues and were trying to resolve them.  Another problem was in creating scheduled pill payments or transfers...the numbers in the splits and the accounts seemed to have a mind of their own, and I had to correct my new entries several times.  In fact, this new Budget Report thing is useless...Ipay for everything with my credit card, then I pay off my credit card with my checking account. This report only tracks payments made from you checking account to your various expense accounts. So, what is the use of having a list of expense accounts with no payments being made to them?  To summarize, I have had to forced to pay for a new version of Quicken whose only differences compared to the 2009 version seems to be an increase in speed (good) and the new budget stuff which does not work (very bad) and is quite uselss. If you are interested in Quicken, check out the website to see the feedback, and NEVER buy an update until your 3 years are up. You might want to look into using Moneydance, which I like...the only reason I have not switched over is that while Moneydance converts all your data files, it does not convert any debt reduction plans and the like. Maybe I should have bitten the bullet and done it anyway.  One last comment: I think people who are switching to the online, free, Mint software and the like are making a big mistake -- you don't know who is looking at your stuff and what they are doing with that information.

They are, for the most part, wrong. I got the game and got the code to start downloading from steam. Steam was acting funny, so I had to wait a day to actually download and play(not a big deal).<br /><br />The game took me about 5 to 6 hours to beat on normal setting, that's with going back to see the different scenario cutscenes.

The levels were not all the same, and had variety in objectives, and kept it from getting boring. The graphics were not the best but definitely good. The story...I don't know what I can say about the story it was interesting in the summary, the beginning, and a little bit of the middle of the game, but then it just took a corkscrew turn into the TV show Lost.

The casting is pretty amazing, I will agree, and the characters are interesting enough.  And yet, there are two main things that I can't seem to get past:  1.  there is really no villain, or character that causes tension in the \""I gotta watch this person get their bad karma back\"" kind of way (more on this expanded below) and 2. I cannot believe in the premise that a total green unknown singer would or could be considered for the lead in a production of this magnitude (meaning the character of Karen Cartwright, played by Katharine McPhee)...chorus, yes...maybe the understudy, yes...but the lead??  Expand on point #1:  No villain:  Well, I guess you could call the \""director\"" Derek Wills (played by Jack Davenport) a sort of not-so-nicey character...though he seems to just be playing the predictable part of the semi-sleazy, semi-sexy hetero director who uses the casting couch to fill his lonely nights in his huge gorgeous apartment.  Starlet #1 (with a good resume), Ivy Lynn (played by a VERY talented Megan Hilty), seems to fall prey to his English charms, though practically perfect and very green wannabe Starlet Karen Cartwright tiptoes up the edge of sin, and then gets the heck out of there because she has a perfectly supportive and loving boyfriend (played nicely by Raza Jaffrey).  No real tension there.  The only other tension might be the upcoming baby-adopting drama between Playwright Julia Houston (Debra Messing is always a pleasure to watch) and her husband Frank (played without much spark by Brian d'Arcy James)...but I don't find this story all that engaging.  Then there is the predictably bitter divorce between Broadway heavyweights Eileen Rand (Angelica Huston is a favorite of mine) and her cheating no-good soon-to-be ex Jerry (played by Michael Cristofer)...yawn.  If the only real tension we have is the battle for thelead, and both of the characters are fairly sympathetic, well, like a said, a movie...not an ongoing television show.  Point #2:  Really?  Karen Cartwright has the chops to steal the lead from triple threat Ivy??  I don't buy it.  I know that the following episodes will show Karen \""working really hard\"", but she is just too lightweight to carry such a large and flashy production.  The very iffy nature of funding a Broadway production (especially when your producer Eileen Rand has an ex who is playing \""hide the cash\"") is just not the place that could even consider casting her (realistically) even if her voice is lovely and she raises her arms in a vulnerable \""Marilyn\""-type way when she is singing.  Can she belt it out (we are certain that Ivy can); Can she dance (we are mesmerized when Ivy does); can she act (the jury is still out for both Karen, and her real-life counterpart Katharine McPhee)?  I guess I just don't buy it that she would even be considered for the lead...they would place her in the chorus, maybe give her the understudy.  So if I don't buy it, well then the main thrust of the plot seems to lose it's effectiveness and plausibility.  Things I like:  LOVE LOVE LOVE the songs that the writing team has come up with for the \""Marilyn\"" production...very clever and believable in a Broadway type way.  I like to see the Times Square tracking shots, but in a weekly tv show these kinds of location shots become too expensive and burdomsome to keep up for multiple episodes, let alone seasons...maybe just a little \""sizzle\"" in the pilot?  The pacing was all right, and I liked the flash-forward fantasy during the rehearsals for the show numbers...since that is the only thing that brought it \""to life\"".  What I will do with this show:  I feel like they have already laid out for me (in the promo that followed the episode) just what will happen....Ivy sleeps with director and then runs off in a huff after not getting the part, Julia will be tempted from some hottie in herpast that joins the production, Karen works hard to become Marilyn and learns to dance (uh, she should already know this cold) and there is probably some other Starlet that will upend Ivy and Karen's dream chance (Uma Thurman?). I don't see any surprises that I am motivated to watch live for.  This show is pretty to look at (and listen to), but without any real tension, or surprising sexy twists...I can easily DVR this and watch it the next day.  Until I am bored with it.  Maybe 3 episodes.  \""Castle\"" on ABC still owns my heart at 10pm Mondays; now that is sexy tension galore!",2012-02-03,793,extra_long,2012-02,videos

Its a good romp of a view but the story is shallow, the character too campy and the cliches while providing a good chuckle at times don't do much to punch up what is really a lack luster and all too predictable story line. It should be mentioned too that it is helpful for understanding the story line (unless you are a dyed in the wool Marvel comics aficionado) to have seem the previous movies for Iron Man, Thor and Captain American. If you didn't catch it I omitted the Hulk here as the characters demeanor for the Hulk was so inconsistent that it almost hurt to have seen the previous Hulk movies.

In addition to this list it's not a great surprise that two new character are thrown at you as there are plenty of Marvel heroes to choose from. To sum up its good, but it's just not great.

Players band together to battle opposing teams and win gold/items. This leads to a very competitive game play experience and often times an oppressive community.<br /><br />Rise of Immortals offers a refreshing change from the usual painful moba experience. The game is centered on a helpful, outgoing and strong community. New players are welcomed on the forums and offered help during their first matches. Older players continue to write guides and help tips/tricks for everyone to enjoy. The newest addition of the \""ROI Wiki\"" is also built to help player's learn and experience everything ROI has to offer.<br /><br />What is even more intriguing about this game is the developer interaction. Players make improvement suggestions on daily basis and also offer feedback to the constant changes. The developers actually take the time to read the posts and respond! Even more shocking, is they DO actually implement some of the suggestions from the players. This is simply unheard of in the game world and will continue to inspire my patronage!<br /><br />Rise of Immortals continues to impress me on a daily basis. The immortals are fun to play and they have interesting lore. The developers put out 2 immortals almost every month! The leveling system is completely unique to ROI. Instead of the typical account wide leveling, player's are able to level up each immortal individually, giving the game an almost rpg-esque feeling. The player base continues to grow and evolve, and the game moves with it. ROI also just received a guild system. This is an amazing tool to make friends, create teams, and work together for competitive play as tournaments are a regular part of the community.<br /><br />For both casual players and competitive \""all stars,\"" this game has something for everyone. Several map types entice players to learn and experience different kinds of arena battles. With such an adoring community, I can't imagine why anyone would go elsewhere. I hope this review will shed some light on a game that I simply LOVE playing. Did I mention, it's free to play and available on steam too?

With a possible trip coming in the fall, I thought that this would be a nice way to get some introduction to the city, especially as I dislike in-person guided tours of cities as a general rule.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKED:<br />- The narrator had a clear, friendly voice that was very easy to listen to.<br />- The recording quality was quite good<br />- The audio tour offered a TON of information, all of it interesting and relevant<br />- Each chapter is a separate MP3 file, and deals with a single monument/point of attraction. This makes referencing very easy!<br />- The included PDF map was high-quality and included all of the monuments/locations discussed in the tour<br /><br />WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE<br />- I felt as though the narrator was talking very quickly. Comprehension was not a problem but personally I like to relax with an audio book. Some second or third-language English speakers may have difficulties with the speed (I only bring this up as I am foreign, but British, so English is not a struggle for me personally but may be for others).<br />- A very MINOR complaint is the \""Bon Voyage Media Presents\"" loop at the beginning of each chapter - conventional audio books will only have this at the beginning (and some times the end) of an audio book.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I really did enjoy the audio tour - not knowing much of Boston's history before this audiobook I cannot attest to the accuracy of all of the included facts, however taking them at face value I feel as though I have learned a lot about its monuments and their significance (also, I now know why it is called Bean Town)! As I mentioned above, I'm not sure that this is an ideal audiobook for those who have a novice or intermediate level of English, however if you are planning a trip to Boston I think you will really enjoy the experience! The included PDF map was very helpful, and a nice touch. I like very much that it is digital, as I rarely travel without my iPad and find nowadays that extra paper products (maps, guides etc.) are more of a burden than anything else. I give this audio tour a four out of five stars, but would probably bump it up to five if a version was released correcting the few minor problems mentioned!'m not sure that this is an ideal audiobook for those who have a novice or intermediate level of English, however if you are planning a trip to Boston I think you will really enjoy the experience!

This game creates its world from the comics and has a similar sense of dread and terror, sprinkled with some mild humor. It's an original story that intersects with characters, locales, and events from the comics. It's all about the characters, and the decision-based gameplay will definitely encourage multiple playthroughs. The graphics are pretty good for a Telltale title; it won't win any awards but the look captures the comics (and an overall comic feel) pretty well. I'd give the game about 4 stars - pretty good, but not for everyone.<br /><br />My main gripe, however, is that this is clearly a console port with little-to-no care in tailoring it to PC gamers. The \""Controls\"" option just brings up a picture of an Xbox 360 controller - no options to remap keys or even anything to tell you what the keys are. It's not too hard to figure out in-game, but not even simply showing Keyboard/Mouse users what the controls are before starting the game (not even counting the fact that you can't reassign the controls), seems to me like a pretty big omission.<br /><br />I have a 360 controller for my PC and am getting accustomed to developers favoring a particular control method (Darksiders and Mass Effect come to mind), so I thought I'd just switch to that instead. That's when I noticed that the game doesn't have any option to invert look. That, to me, was an even larger omission/error than not being able to reassign KB/M controls. I imagine to some gamers, this could be an absolute deal-breaker with either input option. I was (kind-of) able to get used to non-inverted looking, but it still caused many user errors on my part because of what my brain is trained to do naturally.<br /><br />Overall, I still think it's a good game and worth the price. Being that (as of my writing this), only 1 out of the 5 episodes has been released, there is still time for some of these egregious omissions to be remedied. Just be wary before buying if these issues would affect your good time.<br /><br />It also uses Steam. I like Steam but, clearly, not everyone does so keep that in mind as well.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/31/13:<br /><br />I've finally gotten around to finishing the game and, unfortunately, many of the issues I had with the game were left unfixed. The only change was in the \""Controls\"" option which now has a picture of the KB/M controls instead of just the Xbox controls, depending on what you are currently using. I used a PS3 controller with MotioninJoy to invert the Y Axis as tools like x360ce, Durazno, and JoytoKey were unable to do the job with the 360 controller.<br /><br />My 4 star review of the game itself still stands; I thought that the game was very good, not exceptional, and certainly not for everyone. Though the choices you make don't amount to a whole lot in the end, the journey and possible variations, I believe, can still lead to some replayability.",2012-04-27,539,extra_long,2012-04,games

No doubt about it. It has fast paced action (literally, as many scenes involve cycling :-) ). It portrays some great characters (a creepy serial killer, a smart cop, two relentless hitmen, a greedy businessman, and a strong female lead character. The story is gripping, with detailed scenes, well documented on money conterfeiting and laundering.  There were two things that bothered me, though. First, the author insists too much on the virtues of cycling. There are a lot of instances where he emphasizes that Tess is in such great physical shape, that whenever she is stressed she goes for a ride, that cycling through New York is such an intense, almost religious experience. While I don't deny that cycling is great, I felt he stressed this way too much.  Another thing, some of the characters are acting somewhat inconsistent with their personality. For example, detective Ron Stanford, which is a down-to-earth, smart, and kind guy, seems unable to control his sexual attraction towards Tess, even in the gravest of circumstances. It just doesn't go with his character. Another example, we are told that another cop hates Ron, but in all their encounters, everything he says sounds more like friendly banter.

Her career as a pairs skater is blossoming, and a chance at the Olympics seems closer every day. Everything she has dreamed of is so close to being hers, but an unexpected complication threatens everything.<br /><br />Why would Emily risk her Olympic dream?<br /><br />Falling in love with her coach wasn't something she planned, in fact she tried very hard to avoid it, but once caught up in her love for Sergei, she knows there is no going back. But that doesn't mean their relationship is going to be easy.<br /><br />A pet peeve of mine (something even big time writers have been guilty of) is reading a book and it being perfectly clear that the writer has no clue about their topic aside from maybe a quick Wiki search. Trust me, nobody drives down a windy mountain road in Colorado during a blizzard at any speed over about ten miles per hour, even in an emergency.<br /><br />I bring this up just so readers know that Jennifer Comeaux's Life on the Edge does not have this problem. I honestly would have thought Jennifer was a competitive skater at some point in her life if I didn't know better. Her familiarity with the ins and outs of skating shows her passion for the sport and her research ability. Every aspect of the skating side of her book felt very realistic, right down to the terminology and politics. You won't be distracted by obvious gaps in skating knowledge.<br /><br />After setting the backdrop of Life on the Edge so well, Jennifer created a cast of characters to match. Emily and Sergei are the main characters, the ones battling thru emotions, politics, and family animosity, but they aren't alone. Emily's partner, Chris, is not a main focus of the story, but his likeability and fun personality makes you worry about how Emily's decisions will affect him. The other secondary characters were the same. From Emily's roommate, to the junior skaters she helps coach, the rest of the cast filled in the story and made it complete.<br /><br />The main attraction of Life on the Edge is the love story. Yes, the Olympics are huge, but after watching these two resist each other, then fall in love, then have everything put in jeopardy, I couldn't imagine anything that wouldn't be worth giving up for them to stay together. Jennifer does a great job of building their romance early on, then holding back. Even when they do give in, the problems are nowhere near over. Right up to the end, the relationship with its hope and uncertainty at times pulls you through the story.<br />As much as I loved the relationship, I did think there were potential areas to increase the drama a little more, especially when it came to another skater interested in Emily, but that's just my preference. I enjoy a good love triangle, but not everyone does.<br /><br />Life on the Edge is a heartwarming story of love and tribulation young adults and adults will enjoy./>The main attraction of Life on the Edge is the love story.

There were things I really loved and others not so much. One of the things I didn't like much was the main character Parker. You know you have a problem when you don't like the heroine in the story. It's not that Parker was bad, or anything like that, but she felt somehow immature for a thirty-something year old woman and her reactions were or too much or too little. For example, when she learned that her father has lost everything including all her money and her son's trust fund she doesn't have any significant reaction. When she learns she and her five-year-old son are now homeless her reaction is: When do I have to move out? I needed more emotion from her. At the beginning I thought maybe she is in is shock and she is going to have a reaction later on, but the reaction never came. But with James Parker's reactions were a little bit over the top. Something happened involving her son almost at the end of the book and even though what happened wasn't James fault she was a complete bitch with him, she should have been upset with her son not with James. She apologized to James but for me the apology came too late.<br />Another thing I didn't like about Parker is her hate for her own books, if she hated her books so much why did she continue writing them, that was something I couldn't understand, it was not that she needed the money or something like that. Also her mental conversations with the characters of her books were annoying and unnecessary.<br /><br />For me James saved the book; he is a gentleman, he's selfless, caring, sweet and with many more qualities a perfect hero should have. At the same time he has a sad past that tortures him and makes him believe he is not worthy of love. He tried really hard with Parker, he loved her since the first time he saw her but somehow I couldn't understand what was that he saw in her. At the beginning every time they were together she was condescending and infuriating. She didn't show any kind of respect for him, calling him immature nicknames like Thing One or making degrading commentaries out of jealousy for his good relationship with her father.<br /><br />The secondary characters provided some humor and some balance to the story. Some characters from other books by Mrs. Higgins are also present in this book and new characters are introduced. And here with the secondary characters I found another problem. I have read couple of books by Mrs. Higgins and come to realize she uses the same formula over and over with her supporting characters.

That movie takes place in modern day times and while interesting- the character of \""Indrid Cold\"" being the most creepy in my opinion, there are alot of subtle differences between the movie and the doc- you'll see the actual man who interacted- alot- with this strange Indrid Cold (just the description and recreation they use of this \""guy\"" were fascinating to me. The locals tell of how \""men in black\"" would show up at the homes of those who claimed to have seen the Mothman and basically threaten them into silence. Supposedly, these people were quite strange in their own ways too- mannerisms, driving very old yet pristine cars, etc.  I think they based Laura Linney's cop character in the film on a reporter who did many stories on the happenings in Point Pleasant and ultimately gained many locals' trust.  She too had a run in with Indrid Cold- or so they say.<br /><br />Bottom line- if you enjoyed The Mothman Prophecies or enjoy sci fi type mysteries and legends, I think you will find this entertaining. I walked away thinking to myself, \""Why did I never think to look up Mothman online?  I see now that there is much more to the story than just what was depicted in the Richard Gere movie.

The designs and plot are grounded in reality while still retaining fantastic elements, so period-appropriate Renaissance designs exist alongside elves and monsters. The player takes the role of Geralt, a semi-amnesiac white-haired monster hunter known as a \""Witcher\"", who in this game's plot must contend with a globe-spanning plot involving one of his fellow Witchers. The game's writing is compelling, though it varies by character, so for some it may be enough to simply follow the story.<br /><br />The Witcher 2's gameplay is more action-oriented than The Witcher's gameplay was. While the first game's combat was mostly rhythm-based, The Witcher 2 uses a more conventional light/heavy attack system combined with its existing spell-casting system. This is meant to make it seem more like an action game than the Witcher 1, and while it's certainly a more involved system, it's still not exactly good. The relative lack of responsiveness means that battles are in essence flailing messes; you can get a general idea of what's working, but the animation quality and general \""feel\"" of combat leave a lot to be desired. It's not really tactical enough to be good RPG combat, and it's not reflexive enough to be good action combat.<br /><br />The \""RPG\"" elements of the Witcher are more of a background element, as befits an action-RPG. There are skill trees with different upgradable statistics and abilities, but it's not as involved as in a traditional RPG. Rather, the RPG concepts are more about affecting the combat gameplay, which ends up in a lacking experience because the combat gameplay isn't that good. It's possible to take ingredients from nature or fallen monsters in order to brew potions and oils, but really the application of that mechanic isn't too different from traditional crafting gameplay in other RPGs.<br /><br />The game's aesthetics are probably its biggest draw. The game's setting is a Renaissance-level European-style fantasy, and accurate real-life armor and clothing is depicted in the game. However, this doesn't really have a huge impact on gameplay; swords easily pierce through plate armor, and the technology of the period never really matters, meaning that it's a standard fantasy game wrapped up in a nice-looking package at most. The game's graphics are well-executed, but models tend to clip into each other and animations can be somewhat stuttered unless your system is good enough to run it totally smoothly.<br /><br />Overall, though, I didn't care for The Witcher 2. Its combat is average, its graphics are good, and its story is acceptable. It's not really worth praising per se, but it's not terrible, either. It's just sort of a hard game to get into because it follows the standard RPG formula of semi-linear story padded out with fetch quests. If you're into that, it's a good game; if you're not a fan of RPGs, Witcher 2 probably won't change your mind.<br /><br />We purchased this game with our own funds for the purpose of doing this review.<br /><br />Rating: 7/10.lication of that mechanic isn't too different from traditional crafting gameplay in other RPGs.<br /><br />The game's aesthetics are probably its biggest draw.

I hate giving bad reviews, but in all honesty, I did not like this book. It had a lot of promise, and there were some entertaining scenes, but it failed to live up to its potential. The general premise of the story was extremely appealing, but the execution didn't measure up.<br /><br />One of the main problems was that there was too much repetition. For example, we would see something happen to the heroine, then the heroine would go over it in her mind three or four times, and then she would tell someone about it, and then she would go over it in her mind another three or four times. It seemed like padding to increase the word count, it slowed down the storyline, and it got boring and annoying. Eventually, I wanted to scream \""Enough, already, we get it.\""<br /><br />The hero and heroine were supposed to be relatively famous, intelligent, successful professional people. Then why were they so stupid as to \""reveal all\"" in taxis and in public places with strangers nearby, when they wanted to keep the switch secret. This is especially puzzling because they both frequently emphasised the need for secrecy and for not letting the media get hold of the story? For example, when the heroine first discovered the switch, it was OMG I have to keep this quiet, ad infinitum, and then she gets in a taxi in LOS  ANGELES with a friend, waits until she is within sight of her hotel, where she would have a modicum of privacy, and then blurts out the ENTIRE story, knowing the taxi driver is avidly listening. Remember, she is in L.A., home of the paparazzi! She and the hero both came across as TSTL. (If this had been a teen slasher flick, they would have been the first two killed when they separated from the others and begged to be whacked with the meat cleaver when they started to make out in the room where every previous occupant had met a grisly end.)<br /><br />When the media revealed the baby switch, there was way too much annoying dithering by both the hero and the heroine. There was so much \""OMG, what are we going to do, OMG, what are we going to do\"", that I wanted to shake them and tell them to grow some brains and backbones. It was not so much screwball comedy as it was Chicken Little running in circles screaming \""The sky is falling, the sky is falling.\"" The heroine and hero both seemed to be weak characters. Their total lack of common sense, decisiveness, and assertiveness was too extreme to make them attractive characters. In addition, the heroine was so bitchy and petulant that I wondered why the hero was attracted to her. He was not the greatest prize, but at least he was personable and pleasant. Neither one of them was a compelling, engaging character, and I ended up not even caring what happened to them.<br /><br />On the plus side, the heroine's six years-old daughter was fairly adorable and showed more intelligence and common sense than the heroine. A couple of the secondary characters were well-written and likeable. Also, the hero showed some personal growth when he overcame his distrust of marriage and proposed to the heroine. In addition, the book was free of grammatical and spelling errors.<br /><br />I think this story still has the potential to be a very good book with some tweaking. Obviously some readers like it exactly as it is written, but I think it would appeal to more people if some changes were made.<br /><br />  **Edited for spoiler alert**",2012-03-21,627,extra_long,2012-03,ebooks

When a movie is successful there's often the temptation of trying to reproduce that success with a sequel and sometimes it just doesn't work. Case in point: Freddy's Revenge which was a poor sequel and even messed with the original a little and was just an embarrassment. Dream Warriors was intended to be the third and last Nightmare film, the goal was to end as a high note and lay the character to rest. It's probably the best sequel and added backstory to the original along with returning cast and goes back to what made the first film so great. When Dream Warriors was well received and a success came the opportunity to make another sequel and being that horror films are cheap to make and can generate big revenues, a fourth Nightmare flick was made. Dream Master is bit like taking a step back after the step forward that was Dream Warriors. It's entertaining and enjoyable however, it continues on the third film's story and does so reasonably well and doesn't end up a total flunker like the second film, it was even the biggest of the series at the box office. To its credit Dream Master is entertaining and has some of the most creative/entertaining kills of the series and the idea for the script was actually not a bad one.<br /><br />Three of the teenagers from Dream Warriors are still alive and Freddy is after them. One of the survivors, Kristen, who was introduced in the previous film has nightmares about Freddy again and she starts pulling people into her dream and as usually happens Freddy goes after the teenagers one by one. Kristen could summon people into her dreams, that was her gift but soon enough Freddy gets to the survivors and eliminates them one by one. For the franchise to continue there needs to be new victims, before dying Kristen passes on her powers to Alice, and it's her and her friends who become tormented by Krueger who can continue to exist once more. I thought that whole idea made sense and was rather good as far as horror logic and continuation goes.<br /><br />One thing that's noticeable immediately is that Kristen who we first met in Part 3: Dream Warriors is back although Patricia Arquette is no longer playing the role which was given to Tuesday Knight. That was a bit misleading but for continuation purposes it made sense to bring back the character of Kristen who was seen as the new Nancy. I think Arquette made a better Kristen but Knight is not horrible and has a certain appeal to her. They even brought back two other characters from the previous film. The way Krueger is killed is in this one left a little something to be desired, it wasn't awful and probably not the worst way he died in the series but it wasn't totally convincing is how I would put it. After the original Nightmare its sequels introduced more comedy elements and give more of the funny one-liners to Freddy which worked well to a certain degree. Other than some interesting kills, Dream Master is content being almost near comedy territory; it's as if not trying to be as scary anymore and this would only increase with the next sequels.<br /><br />Dream Warriors tied things nicely and was a fitting ending; it went back to origins and had purpose which was ending Freddy and the nightmares for good. Dream Master doesn't work as well because it continues the story but doesn't reveal that much more, it's just an entertaining slasher flick that keeps the party going a little longer (not that there's anything wrong with that). It's certainly not a bad Nightmare and is one of the better and more watchable sequels, other than the fact that an actress who played one of the key characters has been replaced, the story and the film itself are actually good. I feel it's from here that the sequels became less intense and inspired, it almost serves as a link between the first three films and the ones that followed (except the 2010 remake and 1994's Wes Craven's New Nightmare which is really more of a stand alone film and not a continuation). It's a less scary, thrilling nightmare, a bit lighter and more comedy thrown in. It's not a letdown and its actually one of the best sequels only this time around things are a little too lose and predictable.

Will Season 2 be nearly as good, or was this a one-note show? I actually thought that quite a bit between those two seasons. And honestly I had to downgrade it one star for what I and most of my Dead fan friends thought started too talky and not nearly enough action. To be honest, about 3 shows in, I wasn't picking this show off my DVR first any longer. It got bogged down in a lot of feelings (and that criticism is fair because sure I expected a certain amount of expressed emotion in a series this real and horrible (in situations, certainly not in storyline, etc.). But whole episodes devoted to emotions and relationships, here is where the Dead teetered on getting soapy and after the stellar Season 1, it was a stark contrast.<br /><br />However, fear not! Somewhere around Episode 9 (Triggerfinger) and 11 (Judge, Jury, and Executioner) it found its original excitement and energy and got back on track. As I always do when reviewing shows like The Walking Dead,  I encourage you not to allow those under the age of 16 to watch it. There is a great deal of blood and gore (not for the sake of sensationalism, it lends to the reality of the situation of living under the constant threat of the \""zombie virus\"" which has, in season 2, begun to sink in as reality for the characters as well). For people particularly sensitive to this type of action, well, I admit The Dead is not for everyone (I actually am not particularly fond of it myself). But the scenes are not done to pull in boys under 17. It is a full -fledged adult drama that I would put up against nearly anything offered at the movie theaters (in my opinion, in league with Homeland and Sons of Anarchy).<br /><br />I know money is tight now - which I am repeating in my reviews of all seasons of Dead - and I would not push a show I didn't think was worthy of spending it on.

They released two albums and one DVD before activities winded down, and currently they are in some sort of hiatus I believe. Although that may of course change. \""Ancient Beauty\"" from 2000 was their first release, and while the original version is no longer available to my knowledge, the reworked version from 2008 can be found at most any digital music retailer you can name. And it is this version I have been sent by a good friend so that I could write about it.<br /><br />The name of the game here is old music, medieval style. Folk music, but of a particular character. This isn't the tunes the wandering minstrels would perform at the local pubs and taverns for a meal and a drink back in the day. Or rather, while the compositions as such might be just that they were never performed in these arrangements to the public at large back then. Perhaps with the exception being some major fairs, tournaments and other major events. Instead we're dealing with folk music as I would imagine was played and performed by ensembles and groups to the higher class back in the middle ages. Richly arranged, with chamber music qualities, music of a kind I would suspect might be heard on chosen occasions at castles and manors. If at all, that is.<br /><br />The thing is that medical chamber music most likely is more a fact of medieval fantasy than medieval fact. It is a ploy and sound collage often used in moves and TV-series, but if there ever were actual resources and interest in musical arrangements of this character back in the day I don't know. That's something historians with a special interest in culture will have to answer. But the associations one gets when listening to this music is as described above.<br /><br />In the case of Aeternum the acoustic guitar have replaced the lute though, and the flute and violin possibly much less used than when the songs covered were written, or in some cases where the compositions inspired by de facto medieval music was constructed. I haven't tracked the origins of these songs, so I don't know if they are all creatures of their time or if some are contemporary cultural fantasies.<br /><br />Be that as it may be. Acoustic guitar, hand drums, flute and strings are at the core here, in compositions either melancholic or uplifting in spirit, with a slightly timeless feel to them that will transport the mind of the listener back to the days of yore. Music of the kind that the people behind computer games such as Dragon Age and Elder Scrolls, in a perfect world, should have bought and used as soundtracks for their fantasy worlds, as they would have fitted in perfectly.<br /><br />Medieval chamber music with the heart and soul in folk music rather than classical music is what \""Ancient Beauty\"" is about, and at least partially contemporary rearrangements of ancient material at that.

They each have deep feelings still remaining about their dysfunctional childhood and bitter feelings toward their caustic mother.<br /><br />This acerbic cast is directed by Fred Schepisi, from the adapted screenplay penned by Judy Morris and coming from Patrick White's Nobel Prize-winning novel.  This picture provides arresting photography along with an occasional, almost poetic, narrative interjected from an in character Geoffrey Rush.<br /><br />Dorothy is the first to arrive late at the estate in Sydney Australia.  She is immediately uncomfortable with her mother as Elizabeth begins to censure her in a most berating manner.  Dorothy is now divorced from her aristocratic French husband who left her without anything material from the marriage but for her official title of &#34;Princess&#34;.<br /><br />Discernibly flagrant Basil arrives fashionably late, in fact, it is the next day as he explodes through the front door with flowers in tow.  He begins his obvious flattery of his mother who sees right through it and is just as degrading concerning him.  Basil is mainly a Shakespearean stage actor on his way out although still well known and a charmer with the ladies.  He has been knighted with the title of &#34;Sir&#34;.  Dorothy and Basil don't realize until they each arrive just how ill Elizabeth is with dementia.<br /><br />She drifts in and out of lucidity then at times not even recognizing her own children and also her hired staff; a middle-aged, deeply religious nurse along with a younger promiscuous nurse named Flora.  These two women dote on her.  Then there is her doctor who also is her confidant.  Also employed is a housekeeper who puts on deluded speakeasy style skits that Elizabeth demands of her while wearing her charge's clothes, boas, hats, and assorted fashion notions. This woman deserves a study of her own more than a mere few looks into. The employees want to keep their positions with Elizabeth while her children feel it is necessary to have her placed in a home for care.  She really is a reprehensible woman bordering on wicked, presently -  and for the actions of her past.<br /><br />There are quite a few stand-out situations that Elizabeth has demolished for her children.  Even though Dorothy seems to be the one who is always there for her mother, trying so hard to dodge the cruelty towards her now, Elizabeth has done something beyond deplorable to her.  She also has hidden important truths from her children which should be fully disclosed.<br /><br />This truly is an excellent movie.  It moves at a slow pace and focuses heavily on dialog, family interaction that is nothing more than a smackdown, until Basil and &#34;Dot Dot&#34; (as he gets back to calling her) remember how much they really do love each other through all the recalled hurt.  The ending turns in a few places I did not see coming, as I saw it all going along a different path.

I have installed the free version of the anti-virus only edition on my client's computers for many many years. I have one client who bought this full blown security suite version last year (2012 version) and it worked pretty good (no viruses, no headaches).<br /><br />This 2013 version is a very different animal however. I had to remove it after 1 week because it took down my client's business Point of Sale system. This is a very aggressive update. Upon installation it flagged two processes running in memory as malware and placed them in the virus vault. These were mission critical processes to run the POS system, not viruses. Moreover the program did not allow me the option of choosing not to quarantine.<br /><br />Later the AVG firewall flagged two other memory processes used to process credit cards and blocked them from access to the Internet. I had to start the program's GUI and undo all of what AVG had done to get my POS system up again.<br /><br />Now, all the above is actually somewhat forgivable, as anti-virus software often errs on the side of caution. The camel backbreaking straw however is that even though I disabled the memory resident portion of the program, disabled the firewall, and specifically excluded my mission critical processes from being disturbed by AVG, a few days later one of the files for these processes was unceremoniously removed by AVG and the POS system was again rendered unusable (by 'unceremoniously' I mean AVG did not tell me what it had done).<br /><br />As a side note, I would never ever use McAfee or Norton. I cannot tell you how many copies of those two I have pulled off computers over the years to cure their ills. If you define malware as something that slows down your computer, gets in the way of you doing your work, and is a general nuisance, then McAfee and Norton are malware. AVG Security suite now joins this dubious club.<br /><br />UPDATE: A day or two after uninstalling the product we received a pop up message that Windows had updates ready to install. This was a shocking message because we normally have Windows Updates turned OFF, and activate it only at specific times. Upon checking we found that AVG had surreptitiously turned Updates on, and that Windows had installed reams of updates. No matter what you think of Windows Update, the customer should be able to keep a system configured according to their own preferences, not the preferences of the AVG development team... who aren't going to fly out and fix my system when one errant update destabilizes the machine that runs my client's business.<br /><br />UPDATE #2 (June 2013). I recently had the free anti-virus only version of AVG 2013 also delete a critical program without warning (a DHCP server utility called 'Dual DHCP Server'). Using the AVG interface I told it to undo what it had done. It didn't. Had to reinstall the application. AVG used to be a great program but it is has simply gotten too aggressive... and won't even undo its own damage.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I admit that I don't really like any AV software and don't run it on my personal machines. The one program I do have installed -but not running resident- is Malware Bytes (malwarebytesDOTorg). This is a lovely, efficient program that can usually eradicate any once-in-a-blue-moon virus that befalls my machine.

I realize that it's a comparison of two different though sometimes very similar television series, but there are some clear plot and situational similarities as well as budget and big name similarities that make such a comparison somewhat warranted.  I wanted to like Terra Nova, but wanting to and doing so bring two very different results, which require very different levels of effort on the part of those attempting to please.  I feel that Lost delivered where Terra Nova failed and this review is an attempt to analyze just why that is so.<br /><br />In the world of expensive television series, Lost upped the ante such that any subsequent series of equal or more expense in a similar genre, ought to do equally well or even better; or at least have similar ambitions to reach the audience that Lost did so well.  As such, Terra Nova failed.  It is also my own perspective that the writers and producers of Terra Nova had quite a lofty goal, and that is that it would somehow contain enough elements that were attractive to the viewers of shows like Lost to hold the audience's interest for at least more than one season.  I believe their calculations were quite mistaken.  I realize that much of this is a matter of taste, but tastes are often refined the more a person gets to understand and in so doing enjoy a particular genre.  I'm a huge sci-fi enthusiast and as such, I'm analyzing these two series from that perspective.  But I also enjoy a good well-written drama that does not insult certain intellectual sensibilities.  Just the premise of a show like Terra Nova holds some great fascination and excitement for sci-fi fans such as myself.  Any producer should be prepared to sell to the sci-fi fan on substance.  Unfortunately Terra Nova sells the serious sci-fi fan rather short.  A bit of research might have suggested to them that the premise of Terra Nova warranted an element of sophistication thatwould require employing some excellent sci-fi writers, and also to have the foresight to recognize that the Jurassic Park audience of the late 1980s and 1990s had grown and matured, such that they would now demand more intrigue and sophistication and development in plot and dialog.  Again, with the Pilot episode, they failed.  I get the sense that rather than saying as they seemed to in the introductory documentary \""We spent a lot of money on this, so it'll be good,\"" maybe they should have been thinking along the lines of \""We spent a lot of money on this, so it better be good.\""  So for what it's worth, if you are one who thinks in similar veins as a sci-fi fan of discriminating tastes, you may not and probably will not enjoy Terra Nova.  Or perhaps my over-analysis will annoy you more.  Hopefully not.<br /><br />Let's start with the two main \""leader\"" characters from each show for comparison, which in this case are the father Jim Shannon and the leader of Terra Nova Nathaniel Taylor, and in Lost are the doctor Jack Shephard and the hero turned villain of sorts, John Locke.<br /><br />The father here is the doctor there, and the Leader of Terra Nova here is John Locke there, or so I assume in certain respects.  And that assumption may just prove something about my initial impressions.  In Lost we are given no indication whatsoever in the first couple of seasons that John Locke will eventually turn on his friends; while in Terra Nova we are practically told that somehow Nathaniel Taylor is a bad guy.  It's not done so much through character development, but through a device that is intended to be subtle but isn't.<br /><br />OK, this may be a bit contrived and there are certainly other characters who share more than just some significance but in my estimation, the genre of these two series dictates that they either make or break based on these \""leader\"" characters and the writing that makes them engaging.  If they are weak, the whole series in my view is in jeopardy.Why?  Because it is these main \""leader\"" characters who will experience the most screen presence throughout the series.  If the acting or writing are weak in any way, they may not hold the interest of an audience who will potentially tune in from week to week.  A weak character in a movie might be forgiven if the plot and other characters are otherwise strong; but a weak leading character in a TV series of this genre is in my view, a death warrant.<br /><br />In Lost, Jack Shephard carried the pilot episode and shined throughout the series.  We cared about him in the pilot and we desired to know more about him and our desires were fulfilled as the series developed, yet not to the point where we were sick and tired of him.  The entire show was primarily about character development in the face of unusual and mysterious circumstances and as such, it worked.  Even the island itself was a character and as such, it went through its own character development in similar ways to the people.  But it was the pilot episode itself that hooked me into the entire Lost series, and with each subsequent episode I got more and more hooked as it offered one surprise after another in both solving a mystery, yet leaving pieces of that mystery out of place and unsolved for the sake of future expectations.  Of course there were some episodes that were stronger than others, and there was some convoluted melodrama here and there, but all-in-all it was an immensely enjoyable series from beginning to end because of character and plot development; which owe a lot to the script writers as well as to the directors and actors.  The series was worth whatever money they spent on it.  It didn't disappoint.  Well, actually, I thought the very final episode in season 6 was the weakest, and quite a disappointment; but who cares?  It was the strength of the show overall that made us want to be there in the first place.<br /><br />OK, now let's deal with Terra Nova just from the perspective of having seenthe pilot episode.  I watched it several months ago, and it was my contention then as now, that if this is an example of what to expect throughout the rest of the series, it won't last.  It did not hook me in like Lost.  In fact I was quite bored with all the evident cliches and obvious over-exposition.  And in fact Fox has decided not to carry the series into a 2nd season.  Maybe that's too bad; I don't know.  But I can tell you that I would not have allowed the series to continue past the pilot based on what I observed.  I in fact probably would have ordered a rewrite if I were a Fox executive upon previewing this episode.  But Fox apparently had too much invested in it to drop it after the pilot and to rewrite it after filming would have added even more costs, so for better or worse they decided to press on.  But for whatever reasons, the lackluster and in my view shoddy script left us with much less than the kind of pilot that would have left us wanting more after the first few episodes.  In my view the show is an attempt to combine attractive elements of a number of shows and movies with the hope that these elements would cause any audience to stay engaged for a number of seasons.  That alone in my view if true, is a recipe for disaster right from the start, no matter who was involved.  The mere mashing of elements from a number of genres or a number of past successes is not in itself a recipe for success.  There has to be something more.<br /><br />Let's begin by taking a look at these main characters.  First of all Jack Shephard compared with Jim Shannon (both JSh.  Coincidence?).  Well, in the opening of Lost, we learn very little about Jack other than the fact that he's a hero; but just the fact that he is a hero is significant to the rest of the series.  We don't get immediately into past relationships or anything like that and as such, they keep our interest in finding out more about the character as the series progresses.  This is largely true of the other characters as well.  We want to know who the handcuffs belong to, and we are right in assuming that such details aren't obvious.  With detail after detail we are left guessing, and that's all a major part of the fun.  While one mystery is solved, another one develops such that we never get to a point where we can exhale.  There's always more to come.<br /><br />All we see from the opening is the danger the survivors of the plane crash are in, and the fact that Jack is there to help by utilizing his expert skills as a surgeon.  He exudes that which demands confidence; which lends him the trust of the other characters and in one pilot episode we see the result of his heroism and that of others who follow his lead, and we end up with the collectively induced, though temporary miracle of survival, as well as some subtle hints as to how the story might unfold from there.<br /><br />And the writers of Lost were intelligent enough to include elements that are present but not explained in the pilot.  They become important later on, yet are not so obviously pointed out as important that we should know to remember them; such elements as the small airline-size bottle of vodka Jack has in his pocket upon waking after the crash; or the dog who comes up to him as he's laying in the reeds just off the beach; or even the presence of Locke himself, helping to lift a piece of the plane off of one of the survivors.  That, in fact is one of the few glimpses of Locke we get in the pilot episode.<br /><br />So these little glimpses are easily missed, and that's what makes the development of the story and the solving of the many mysteries so enjoyable.  What does Terra Nova give us in that vein?  Some hieroglyphs on a rock.  Well isn't that a bit obvious?  It's not all that mysterious then when we are told that something mysterious will happen.  And then Terra shows us some cute herbivorous dinosaurs, which in no way advance the plot other than to tell us that there are dinosaurs present.  Duh!!!  While it is true that Lost employs similar elements, it does so in a much more subtle manner and only with intent to advance the actual plot; and that in and of itself demands that we pay attention.  It doesn't tell us to pay attention; we have the freedom to decide that on our own.  But while missing the cute herbivores will not cause us to miss anything that Terra Nova may tell us upscript, Lost encourages us to re-watch what we may have missed.  Thus, reruns offer a welcome potential for further delight; and as such, it is my estimation that Lost will be enjoyed for decades to come.  But Terra Nova tells us to pay attention by the obvious placement of the hieroglyphs; and as such, we are at that point likely to lose all interest in trying to figure things out on our own, which would be much more fun.<br /><br />In Terra Nova we are left with very little mystery, and yet that mystery appears to be its intent.  It appears that most or all of the important players are introduced to us, and it seems like the intent of the episode is to do just such an introduction without giving us any hint as to why we should care.  So in all of these elements, the actual intent of Terra Nova is all mixed up.  It doesn't seem to know where to lead us other than that something exciting might happen; or maybe not.  After all, the cute dinosaurs might be indicative of peace and harmony.  I'm sorry, but what might have worked in Jurassic Park does not translate here.<br /><br />In Terra Nova Jim Shannon is a flawed but loving father who abandoned his family due to some circumstances quite beyond his control, but still, why should we care?  You don't get an immediate first impression of him as in any way heroic; not that that was the intent, but again, still.  Not one of the main characters in Terra Nova seem terribly heroic or on the other hand, terribly evil and as such they appear rather bland.  They're all in it for their own self-interest; that's apparent and as such, when danger arises you don't end up caring too much for them, and the care that you do end up feeling is forced on you by exposition.  I get enough of that from soap operas (which is why I don't watch them much).  And as the impression I got from Nathaniel Taylor, so I got from Jim Shannon; rather bland and not well developed.<br /><br />OK, now onto Nathaniel Taylor compared with John Locke.  Some may find it quite unfair that I compare the two; but I do so just to give us a feel for what works in an established \""leader of the troops\"" sort of character, and what doesn't.<br /><br />I recognize also that as in Lost so in Terra Nova, there are two or more leaders who don't often see eye to eye and that may provide us with some of the intrigue.  However, Lost does a much better job in portraying that conflict than does Terra Nova.  How so?  Well for starters Lost does not introduce Locke immediately.  It does not introduce any of the other characters as leaders immediately.  We don't get an immediate introduction to the essential players in the pilot of Lost as we do in Terra Nova.  In fact, in Lost some of the essential players are not introduced until the 2nd or 3rd seasons.  So Locke is somewhat of a mystery at first, and we don't get a sense that he has any leadership capabilities, nor that he will have a significant role later on.  We discover those capabilities; in fact, we witness them develop from episode to episode and while the mystery of his character continues throughout the series, we clearly begin to see towards the end of the 1st season that he will play a larger more significant role than most of the other characters.<br /><br />In Terra Nova with Nathaniel, we get the assumption of his leadership not by character development, but by the script (or rather characters) telling us who he is.  So we don't end up getting any real clear circumstances for why he above all has earned the position through good or bad action on his part, other than the fact thathe was there first.  Some may ask why the series would need to do this?  Well, it's a TV series.  As such they have much more time to develop these things while continuing the plot and action of the story than if it was a 2 hour movie.  Why shouldn't they take the opportunity to at least try to develop the characters a bit more?  In Nathaniel's case  We get subtle hints as to what might have happened, but it seems quite convoluted.  And furthermore, we don't even get any sense other than through exposition in the pilot whether Nathaniel is a hero or a villain and I think at that point in order to draw us in, there should be some kind of hint that at least one of the main characters has some ill intent, but we get none of that.  We guess that through cheap facial expressions and costuming conventions, but not through action, dialog or plot.  There's nothing intriguing about his character that will have us either like him or loathe him.  He just is.  Whatever we need to know about him is told to us by other characters and we get absolutely nothing from his projections or from the plot.  He is for all intents and purposes a blank slate, and blank slates don't hold my interest.<br /><br />So I guess, given just the bits I've observed so far, the dramatic devices utilized in Lost compared with those utilized in Terra Nova that we can get directly from the pilot episodes, are the differences between \""telling\"" a story (Terra Nova) and \""showing\"" a story, (Lost).  Television, like the motion picture is primarily a visual medium.  As such, it does much better showing us action rather than telling us what the action is or was.  Why not rather read a book if you want to be told a story?  Also, why spend enormous amounts of money on visuals for a TV show if all I'm going to do with them is tell a story through exposition rather than show a story through great character development, plot and mystery/intrigue?  I'm much more engaged in a story that is shown to me through characterdevelopment and the sort of plot circumstances and situations that show me that a particular character has earned their position through evil or good behavior, as opposed to a story wherein the characters themselves spend half their time telling the important details of the story rather than the story itself unfolding with said details.  Terra Nova wastes many opportunities therein, such as showing scenes of wildlife and scenery, which in no way advance the plot, while having characters announce who so and so or such and such is, rather than demonstrating who they are through plot and dialog.  As such, it's blandness becomes even more apparent.<br /><br />In Lost Jack earned his position through his heroism (shown) in the pilot episode.  Not one of the characters had to tell us that Jack was a hero; we got that through the opening scenes, and his continued instances of heroism throughout the season.  Not one of the characters had to tell us that there was a plane crash and that they're on some sort of island cut off from the rest of the world; and they were able to suggest that without actually showing us or telling us about a plane crash.  The visuals were enough to imply that.  Locke gradually earned his position through trial and error combined with his experiences, which are further expounded upon as the series develops, but very rarely does another character have to tell us details about Locke that we can't get from his actions and dialog alone.<br /><br />But Terra Nova is littered with needless exposition (i.e., telling and/or narrating the details so that we can understand what's happening, rather than showing us through the visuals, action and dialog).<br /><br />In Terra Nova Nathaniel earned his position by the script telling us he has, without further expounding on how he got there.  In other words, Terra Nova commits one of the first mortal sins of script writing.  They tell us the story much more than they show us.  They should have shown us more in the pilot.  They should and could have started the series with Nathaniel and what circumstances led him to be the leader of the large community that now exists; even if only briefly.  The instance where he finds himself in Terra Nova might have been an excellent place to start the series, even if he's not the main character.  His story advances the rest of the plot.  That would have hooked me into the further adventures in subsequent episodes, but as it stands, I could not get past the pilot, and I have absolutely no interest in continuing past that.  The other main character and leader, Jim Shannon was also told to us.  They pretty much told us that he would be there to lead right in the pilot and left little or nothing to the imagination; nothing to look forward to that would make me excited about solving the mystery; hieroglyphs or no hieroglyphs; but I sense that they sold the audience short.  They assumed that the audience is too lazy to figure things out, so they must be told.  In short, they failed to hook me in.<br /><br />Well another issue is the quality of the acting, and Lost was far above Terra Nova in that regard.  I was not impressed with Stephen Lang in Avatar, so I did not hold much hope for him in Terra Nova either.  It's not that he's a bad actor; it's just that he's not ideal for these types of roles.  I thought he was quite good in character roles in Gettysburg and Public Enemies.  I don't think he's lead character material.  He doesn't in my view convincingly carry a major role, and just because he was in some supporting roles in some big name movies, does not translate that he'd be good in whatever role is provided in a television series where one has to significantly perform and hold the interest of an audience through sometimes years of performance.  But his lackluster performance in Terra Nova may have been and probably was due to the script, and as TV series go, they sometimes do get better.  Regardless, he is in my view a very good character actor and not a leading actor.  I feel the same about the other characters/actors.  Some will say that he's not really a lead in this; but that would be beside the point.  He is introduced as having a significant role.  Therefore, whether he delivers that or not in subsequent episodes is immaterial.  In the pilot he's significant, yet unremarkable as far as both performance and as far as the material he had to work with.  That's really no way to begin a television series; especially not an expensive one.  There are some sci-fi series I rather enjoyed that had much better minor character development on much smaller budgets than this one has with it's major players; Farscape comes to mind.<br /><br />In Lost, the character actors as well as the leads were able to shine with an excellent script.  Evangeline Lilly, Jorge Garcia and others were given great characters and dialogue, which made the show all the more intriguing.  They were quite obviously all very well vetted for the parts they played and it worked.  It payed off.  And while Lost had elements of other previous shows about castaways, it was altogether different than anything that had gone before.  This is because it combined a familiar circumstance with one that is altogether mysterious, mystical, sci-fi/fantasy-ish and otherwise intriguing.  It knew who its potential audiences would be from the start.  Those would be the sci-fi crowd who had seen a lot of sci-fi and weren't fooled by convention; the mystery game crowd who enjoyed games like Myst and Riven and who liked solving all of the puzzles on the islands of the Myst universe; as well as appealing to perhaps a new audience who didn't know what to expect.  It exceeded in its appeal to all of those and more; which is why it lasted for six seasons.  Terra Nova in it's attempts to do similar combining of familiar elements and in its attempts to please without knowing exactly who, is by all initial accounts a very expensive flop.  I doubt if it will evenhold much interest as a cult favorite.  Terra=Earth and Nova=new, but from all observations we're dealing with all too familiar territory.",2012-04-28,3963,extra_long,2012-04,videos

It had tons of features; however, it was MASSIVE and took up all of my desk space and then some (with all of its detached components). I sold this unit to begin looking at recording software, ProTools to be exact.  While looking on Amazon for ProTools, I ran across Samplitude Producer. After some hesitation due to its being new, I decided to download the trial version of Samplitude to give it a try.  Best decision I have made yet in regards to recording. This software is, in my opinion, just as good as ProTools and will save you about $500 in the process as well. Everything that I have needed thus far to record, mix, master, and \""tweak\"" my music [and vocals of course] has been contained in this one software package. The interface is very clear and easy to navigate around in (I do recommend using at least two monitors, though..just to give yourself plenty of space for all the features). Each track has its own \""mini-mixer\"" and then can be perfected later on using the master board. I am by no means an expert or a professional, but I do know a little bit about audio engineering, and this little software package is awesome.

It was pretty linear with not much in the way of optional movement.  But the visuals were good and the behavior of the adversaries was OK.  I don't play online - usually just campaign mode so I can't comment on multiplayer.  And so from that perspective it was worth the $10.19 I paid.<br />I would have given it 3 stars and said it was a good value overall - kept me somewhat entertained - if you can call trying to kill imaginary things any form of entertainment - which I must or I wouldn't have bought it.  The problem I have with this game is the premise that any modern army from a civilized nation would behave in the manner claimed in this game.  I don't think it's possible for any large group of American soldiers to ever behave, orders from on high or not, in the manner that is the basic premise of this game.  The idea that an American Army would execute civilians on a mass scale such as this is preposterous to me.  I had read other reviews that made this game appear to be an anti-war statement - if so it fails miserably because ultimately it is really about nihilism - that no matter what choices you make everything is doomed.  Reminds me of some of the European fiction and movies that came out in the 20 or so years following WWII in which in war there was never any victor - everyone loses.  And while that is somewhat true - that everyone loses something in a war - not all wars are unjust - as in the case of WWII where fascist governments which put themselves above the people and had to be overthrown.  This lesson is something I think people tend to forget - that what we take for granted today, personal freedom, was won by taking life - for the most part the lives of innocents and the duped who wanted to believe politicians, who care generally only for themselves - but in some small numbers the perpetrators of atrocities against humanity like Hitler's Nazi Party, and the feudal military culture of pre WWII Japan.  We have a long way to go to grow out of that.  But blaming the citizen soldiers we employ to protect ourselves by portraying them as capable of these kinds of atrocities, as this game does, in such a realistic contemporary way is almost inexcusable.

The campaign will take you around 6-8 hours to finish, and then there are arenas where you can fight against enemy waves or duel with other players.  The matchmaking system is poor at best -- it's very difficult to get into a random public group.  My advice would be to convince a buddy to pick up a copy and play online together, or enjoy the campaign solo.  Lacking an experience/leveling mechanic, skill points, inventory, or currency, this game focuses on its unique combat system comprised of combining 8 elements: water, life, shield, cold, lightning, arcane, earth, and fire.  After conjuring a mix of 1 to 5 elements, you release the spell in 1 of 4 ways: a projectile/beam/wall, a cast-on-self, an area of effect, or cast on your melee weapon (think enchanting).  Want to make a rock wall that freezes enemies?  Combine cold + earth + shield.  Want to make a far reaching, electrocuting steam beam?  Combine water + fire (steam) + arcane + lightning.  Also, as you progress in the campaign you unlock special spells like summons, teleportation, blizzard, lightning storms, etc.  Some of these really become necessary to survive in the later levels, where the enemies move quickly and pack a punch.  The tricky part is that friendly fire is always on, which makes for some hilarious and frustrating experiences.  All in all, this is a fun and short adventure for the relatively low price.  Just make sure you grab 1-3 online friends for the best experience.  Pros:  + Complex and fun combat system  + Hilarious references to geek culture  + Relatively good challenge / difficulty curve  + Nice art direction, appealing graphics  Cons:  - Multiplayer matchmaking system is awful; play with friend(s) instead  - Low replay value due to lack of a leveling mechanic, skill/experience system, inventory/currency  - Slightly stingy checkpoint system  - Cheap deaths from getting knocked off the terrain or being one-shotted can be frustrating",2012-02-14,337,long,2012-02,games

This girl and I?  We aren't ever going to be best friends, or even drinking buddies.  If there's something that keeps me coming back for more, it's the story, and not the assassin.<br /><br />Celaena bandies about calling herself the world's greatest assassin in a cast off way that only the cockiest can manage, but Celaena?  I'm beginning to think the words `world's greatest assassin' don't mean what you think they mean.  The Assassin and the Desert opens with our girl Celeana being sent to the desert to train with the sessiz suikast-The Silent Assassins, a legendary order that will (her own master hopes) be able to teach her some obedience and discipline.  It would seem that for the `world's greatest assassin', she has a lot of learning to do before she is up to par.  At their fortress in the Red Desert, Celeana works side by side with the Silent Assassins, hoping to catch the individual attention of the Mute Master, whose letter of approval she must procure in only one month's time.<br /><br />Celaena shows up to this renowned order expecting to get one-on-one tutelage from the Mute Master, who is essentially the match of her own master in this part of the world.  Despite the fact that her roommate and friend, Ansel, has been living there five years and received no private lessons, Celaena throws little hissy fits about how she should be getting more special attention.<br /><br />Again, she shows her incredible vanity, and while I appreciate that Celaena does think and react with the quick temper of a teen, her short fuse and lack of insight doesn't really scream to me that she is the world's greatest assassin.  When I think assassin, I think cool, calculating, intelligent, quick, and stealthy...I'm not really sure she's any of these things.  In fact, I'm in Ansel's court when she tells Celaena, \""You're just a spoiled, selfish bitch.\""  Celaena is subject to goading, and falls prey easily to the Biff style taunts of \""What are you, chicken?\""  She's incredibly attractive, but oh poor girl's never had any suitors, and she has a taste in very expensive and delicate undergarments which is usually something you only read in a marginally trashy romance novel.<br /><br />Have I made my complete dislike evident enough yet?  Okay, okay, back to the story, because that is what keeps me reading (though I swear, if it takes me half of Throne of Glass to overlook Celaena and enjoy the story like it has in these novellas, I don't know if I'll make it through).  The Silent Assassins are essentially a mercenary set up in the middle of the desert, where they live and train and accept jobs from those who would hire them.  Celaena is used to Arobynn's household, where she has lived and trained since the age of eight.  In Arobynn's world, she was taught to distrust everyone, even allies.  Brutality and a cutthroat mentality were encouraged, and friendships have been a rare thing.  In the Red Desert, Celaena finds more of a brotherhood (which is also far less sexist and half the assassins are women by the way), a community where real trust and friendships exist, and for a short time she can live in ease with those around her.<br /><br />The Silent Assassins are not without their own enemies, however, and Celaena soon learns that the nearby Lord Berick seeks to put the Mute Master's head on a silver platter.  Lord Berrick hopes that by eradicating the assassins he can end the embargo placed on the Red Desert by the King of Ardalan for lack of support in a previous battle.  It is up to Celaena to insure that this doesn't happen.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed The Assassin and the Desert as much as The Assassin and the Pirate Lord.  I appreciated a fresh cast of characters, a completely altered setting, and an alternative perspective of her world.  At this point, however, I sincerely doubt that I'll be picking up the other novellas as I'm certain I can't take this shallowness for 2 more novellas and a novel.  Here's hoping I don't DNF Throne of Glass!y doubt that I'll be picking up the other novellas as I'm certain I can't take this shallowness for 2 more novellas and a novel.

But recently my computer crashed and it seemed like the right time for an upgrade so I purchased Quicken Essentials. What a disappointment. Though the interface is sleeker and the program seems to run, or almost glide, more smoothly, the basic functionality that I depended on Quicken for isn't there. One of the functions I appreciated in Quicken 2004 so much was the ability to categorize transactions in splits. Ie,  you could enter one payment to a credit card, for say, $500, and then record all of the different categories the payment went to, as well as the amounts, $100 for groceries, $50 for gas, and so on. The new version of Quicken isn't able to do this. If you pull up a category like gas, Quicken includes the TOTAL amount of every split payment that includes $ towards gas. Instead, you're required to create an additional account for your credit card, and track the charges there. That does have some pluses - you can automatically download transactions which can be very convenient, but when it comes to tracking your spending, a charge to your credit card is not the same thing as paying the credit card bill. So, if it's spending/expenses you're trying to track the numbers just don't ad up. Unless that is you you want to enter a separate entry for every single item on the bill as you pay it, which I guess you could also do. That however would make reconciling your accounts tricky, as payments wouldn't easily match up.<br /><br />There may be a solution to this problem, but that in itself IS another problem with Quicken Essentials. While it looks pretty and has superficial functions like tag clouds (Quicken shows you a cloud with the tags for categories you spend the most on, like on a blog, the words for the categories you spend more on, like gas or groceries, appear larger) it's really hard to get basic information. You can create reports but they don't include the memos you enter along withthe transactions - $50 for gas, Mom's bday. Again, this can make tracking things really difficult.  Also, customer support is fairly lacking and instead there's a user community. I know that's standard fare, but it took me a couple of days to sort out the answer above and while users are fairly helpful it does make you feel, as a customer, tossed aside. Why Quicken didn't put the resources it put into building and moderating an online community, into retaining basic functions required for bookkeeping instead is a bit of a puzzle.

It is not a BAD album, because we all know we've heard much worse--but by Manowar standards, this is probably their worst full-length LP, at least upon first impression. I'll get into some of the reasons why in a moment.<br /><br />What is strange is that this comes off the heels of THUNDER IN THE SKY: which I thought was the best thing they've done since Triumph of Steel. Fantastic songs, great performances with real feeling, and some of the best production value I've heard in a metal album in a long, long time. The thing kicked ass, and that little EP is probably the antithesis to this in all the ways I mentioned.<br /><br />I think there are a few main problems on this. First is that the album is simply boring. I listened to the first half of it and stopped because, aside from the great first track, everything was plodding, paint-by-numbers. The tracks weren't necessarily bad, they were just completely mediocre. Only at the very end does the album pick up, and then only a little. I had the same initial feeling for Warriors of the World, but the worst tracks there are on par with most of the better tracks here, and when that album kicked ass it really did so. This one is just uninspired and bland. It has been described as \""simplistic, back-to-basics\"", perhaps in response to Gods of War, but not in a good way, it is simplistic and bland in a rather uninspired way, not unlike Metallica's St. Anger.<br /><br />The second is the production quality. The songs are written boringly, but the album sounds boring too. I thought my EQ settings were wrong at first and spent a good ten minutes playing around with my system trying to fix the problem before I realized it was just the way the album is. People complain about Joey's bass tone, and while it is a bit distracting, I kind of liked that super-overdriven buzzy sounding tone, it could be mixed a bit lower but it sounds fine to me, and at least he tried something new. That's not the problem. The problem is everything else. The guitar is too low, Eric Adams sounds gruff and processed, and poor Donnie, the drums have absolutely no kick to them. That, for me, is the main problem. Thunder in the Sky and the redone Battle Hymns sounded AMAZING, and they both had huge drum bass. Here, every ounce of bass in the mix is dedicated to Joey's bass guitar, and it flattens everything out while simultaneously having that dull full-bass-the-entire-song kind of sound. Manowar's last albums from Warriors of the World to Battle Hymns 2011 sounded amazing, and powerful. This is a bit of a mess. The album has great clarity and fidelity, but it just sounds really weak and unbalanced. It is hard to exactly put your finger on.<br /><br />The final problem is that there seems to be little passion here. Joey does okay, but the guitars are kinda meh and the solos seem a bit incoherant, the drumming, if you can hear it, is simple and uninspired, and Eric Adams gives a painfully bad performance and sounds like he is phoning it in. The guy is such a great singer, and you only need to listen to Battle Hymns 2011 or Thunder in the Sky to see this lineup at their finest. Perhaps because the songs were so bland no one could find the passion for this. Something just isn't quite working the way it normally does.<br /><br />All in all, if you are a Manowar fan, you will listen to this, and it is worth one listen for curiosity. Some will like it, many probably out of psychological obligation to like everything they do, but let's be honest: this is not a particularly good album. And it's not like they are past their prime or incapable of innovating. I loved Gods of War, a severely unfairly criticized album, it was bold and daring and took the band to new territory, with complex songs and an entertaining production. What happened here? The same thing that happens to bands sometimes. They simply made a poor album. It happens. The next one will probably put them right on track. It's a shame they just didn't add two or three songs to Thunder in the Sky and release that as an LP, and whittle this mess down to the best four songs and put this out as a bonus EP. Oh well.<br /><br />I gave this album 2 stars but I really wanted to give it 2.5. It does sound a bit harsh to give it two, but I don't think it is quite deserving of 3. As I said it is not out and out terrible, but it's quite poor by Manowar standards. The bottom line was that it just did nothing for me. I will, however, say that I suspect that this album may grow on me a little. Worthwhile songs: Lord of Steel, Born in a Grave, Touch the Sky, El Gringo, Annihilation. (You see? It's just an average EP with tons of filler! =bad LP)<br /><br />But you know, I am sure Manowar is listening to some of this feedback, so maybe they will tweak it a bit for the CD version. As I said, the mixing is a bit weird, and I suspect there is a better album in there trying to get out, but if mixing was the only problem on here we'd be in okay shape. Listen to Dawn of Battle and Thunder in the Sky and then listen to this...there's no contest, it may as well be two different bands. Manowar, your fans love you but this just didn't work the way you wanted it to.",2012-07-21,983,extra_long,2012-07,music

This was the golden age of bop trumpet, of Dizzy, Fats Navarro, Miles, Clifford Brown, with Chet Baker, a fine, influential player, also in the mix.<br /><br />My 14 year old self  already had Harry James as my swing trumpet hero, so who needed Braff, who was young enough to bop like the others, but insisted on playing in the old style. I doubt that I ever listened to both sides of the LP.<br /><br />A few weeks ago I ran this album down on Amazon to give it a careful hearing. I was delighted. The rhythm section, consisting, as listed on the album cover, of Milt Hilton, Jo Jones, and Marty Napoleon, is sterling. (I had always thought of Napoleon as a corny throwback. Boy, was I wrong. Believing initially that Sir Charles Thompson, like Braff, a New England mainstay, was on piano, I found myself thinking that I had underestimated Sir Charles's skills. Wrong. It's Marty  playing all that fine piano.) When Napoleon plays in the Basie mode, he and Jones blend souls.<br /><br />Trombonist Billy Byers is an effective B+ trombonist, and I find B+ players a trip to listen to. Byers is no exception. Sam Margolies is a solid tenorist, who mixed two light-toned stylists, Lester Young and Bud Freeman, to form his style. I got annoyed when he used inappropriate vibrato on a typically Prezidential phrase, until I recognized it as Bud's vibrato. The phrase then appeared in its true light, as a Bud Freeman lick. I now appreciate Margolies much more.<br /><br />Ruby is a powerful, original swing trumpeter; he had to be to have such a long career. Now there are swing trumpeters who moved on to bop, Howard McGhee, who spoke bebop with a strong Roy Eldridge accent, and Harry James, who played bop brilliantly with a thick Harry James accent. Ruby discovered an infinite variety of fine music without ever playing a note that did not have pure swing era provenance.<br /><br />Ruby, it is said, did not read music. You would never know it: some these tunes are arranged and formatted to a fare-the-well. Benny Goodman, who could read music in his sleep, and expected his sidemen to be on a similar level, used Ruby extensively and well.<br /><br />The album is cheap, the music fascinating: buy it!<br />(There are other personnel listings for drummer and pianist. If the drummer was not Jo Jones, then I am deaf. The pianist does not sound like Kenny Kersey to me, but I won't go to the mat for that one.)",2012-10-20,453,long,2012-10,music

This game is really fun,"The Good: Beautiful visuals, engrossing story and character, fun and fast paced combat, varied locales, challenging boss fights, choices make an impact on story, compatible with AlienFX<br /><br />The Bad: Very linear, loot isn't very good, predictable enemies, boring cut scenes and dialog segments, bad partner AI, issues with AlienFX<br /><br />Dungeon Siege is one of the fathers of the dungeon crawling genre on the PC. There's just something addictive about running around smacking everything and trying to find the best loot. Don't forget about challenging boss fights though for the best loot. Dungeon Siege III continues this tradition with an engaging story, interesting characters, and beautiful graphics. The game, however, falls flat on a few notes.<br /><br />You get to pick a character amongst four with their own unique background story. I chose the Lescanzi female that uses guns for combat. I got a long-range carbine as well as a pistol and shotgun combo backup for close range. As you run around killing enemies you can use a variety of powers that use focus, and you gain this by killing enemies and hitting them. Think of this as mana. Then you have power orbs you can use for special attacks, but these only regenerate when enemies die. These powers vary by character, but they are essential for winning battles. I found combat to be fun an addictive here, but I never really felt I had the upper hand. I ended the game at level 35, did 99% of side quests, and still struggled through some tough fights. I had the best armor and weapons, but always I was struggling. Using my offensive, defensive, and passive powers really helped for healing, staggering enemies, knocking them back, and slowing them down. If you play single player you get a partner (Anjali the fire archon), but there are some problems here.<br /><br />The game is best played in multiplayer, but the single player AI for your partner is touch and go. When you fall you don't die until your partner dies, but they can revive you. I had issues where I was in tough fights and she just kept fighting and never came to heal me, then she became overwhelmed and died. This was frustrating because you revert to the last save point, and long boss fights towards the end can make you tear your hair out in frustration. However, the game would be impossible to play without the revive feature so I am grateful for that.<br /><br />Exploring is very linear with a few branching paths, but at least you won't get lost thanks to the quest line you can pull up and follow around. Besides, going off the beaten path isn't worth your time because there's no \""major\"" loot. Every chest seems to have a few various items and some gold. The armor looks great and shows on your character visually, but most of it was junk. Unless you access a new area the shops will have poor armor, but rarely did I get one that boosted every attribute. Usually I had to sacrifice attack power for more armor, agility for will, elemental damage for will, and so on. Where is all the good high level armor at? It doesn't really exist, and enemies drop armor and weapons that are worse than what are at stores. Dungeon crawlers are all about the awesome loot and Dungeon Siege III is lacking it.<br /><br />At least the story is interesting with your character trying to recruit legionnaires to stop Jeyne Kessynder's army. There is dialog choice that affects how the game turns out, and these actually meant something. A choice early on can make a boss fight later easier. My only problem here is that the conversations are dull because you just stare at the characters and usually skip most dialog. The voice acting is good, but that's no excuse for dull ways of doing dialog. Between each chapter are hand drawn art slides, but they are ugly and I would have liked to see some nice pre-rendered ones.<br /><br />The graphics are gorgeous with great lighting effects and high-resolution textures. The locations vary immensely and you alwayslook forward to seeing what area you will be in next. The music is great as well with beautiful orchestral scores the follow in your footsteps. Dungeon Siege III is worth the bargain bin price these days, and dungeon crawler fans will have a blast here with challenging boss fights, and varied locales to explore. Don't expect great loot, or even varied enemies because the enemy setup tends to be predictable. Dungeon Siege III is a fun dungeon crawler, but could have been better.<br /><br />Note: The game is compatible with AlienFX for those lucky enough to own an Alienware computer. When you health bar is green all your lights are as well, same when yellow, and then red. This is really neat, but the problem is there is a delay for some reason and it was never patched. Your health will be red, but then your lights are still green. This only happens some times, but nonetheless, it is a cool feature.look forward to seeing what area you will be in next.

To me is immaterial - just mentioning it.  This is stated in description as prequel.  It read as potential for such - but reads as stand alone piece (which I prefer) .  There was no cliffhanger ending - it finished for this short.<br /><br />Leon Brown is an Army Ranger who sees action overseas, gets injured about the time a family tragedy strikes and he is sent home on compassionate leave - rather than re -deployed.  His past is of the streets and gangs and petty crime type.  He gets foisted into the army rangers to avoid prison time (I will explain my issues with such later), becomes a better man for the trainging (per his own narrative).  Due to the circumstances of the tragedy, his mindset of integrity and operating within a code of honor will be tested as he finds a need for vengeance overpowering.  This short is him going through the paces toward the goal of satisfying resolution for his sister.<br /><br />It is not a horrible premise - but a lot needs be ignored in order to swallow the tale as presented.  The Army Rangers is an elite group that has minimum threshold for acceptance.  A test is one of the requirements.  Since Leon was a child of the streets (rather than studious) it is unlikely he could pass the test minimum.  Additionally, one must pass a security clearance check which someone with a criminal background and headed for prison is unlikely to pass.  I am uncertain that the armed forces even offer service to country (this is set in 2005 or 2006) to prevent jail time.  I have heard of such from many, many years ago (youthful offenders being allowed to enlist to thwart such) - but I do not think the practice has occurred in decades.  In any case (say they allow) - it is very unlikely that such \""recruit \"" would be allowed into elitist ranks of rangers straight from the starting gate.  So, I had some real issues with plausibility (even though fiction) of given plot device as foundation of story.  It (if allowing all that as believable) is really beyond suspension the conclusion this soldier came to related to his decision of returning to duty.

A lot of people feel the same way and so \""Austen Spinoffs\"" are very popular.  However they seldom live up to the originals, expecially when it is a sequal to a spinoff, like THE EDGE OF REASON is a sequel to the spinoff, BRIDGET JONES DIARY.  Some Jane Austen spinoffs REALLY stink, and I have to say that in comparison, THE EDGE OF REASON isn't actually all that bad.  I was mildly entertained for an evening and I got a few laughs.  But it just doesn't do it for me like a \""True Jane\"", and by the next day, I was having a hard time remembering exactly what this movie was about.<br /><br />I don't especially get the populaitry of Bridget Jones, since apart from the bare plot paralells and play on names (like Darcy) the actual sense of the story is far from PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.  Bridget Jones is in no way similar to the intelligent, poised, witty, self possessed Elizabeth Bennett.  In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, it is easy to see why Darcy falls for our Lizzy, but I keep wondering what he sees in the grasping, silly, promiscuous, annoying and just plain embarassing Bridget!  Both characters are disadvantaged, but Elizabeth Bennett's shortcomings are completely external while Bridget Jones's issues are an ingregal part of her personal core. I suppose the point of the story is that if Bridget can find happiness with Darcy, then all of us everygirls have hope.  But for this kind of plot to interest me, it would have to have something that makes sense about his attraction to Bridget.  Elizabeth Bennett was beneath Darcy's social status, but she was a superior woman and you could see why he loved her - she was his equal in temperment, character and intellegence.  The fact that he was able to recognise her worth,and love her is the main thing that made him attractive as a love interest.  We all want to believe that there is something loveable in us, and a man who sees our finer qualities is dream boat!  But I definately didn't swoon over Bridget's Darcy.  She was beneath him in every possible way and I couldn't connect with them as a couple.  In fact, I found it hard to even respect a guy who could fall for someone like Bridget and the idea her as a heroine was a little depressing.  It just wasn't believable and therefore I didn't really care if they got back together or not.<br /><br />I also don't get Renee Zellwegger in the title role.  She is sometimes a decent actress, but I didn't find her believable as a Brit, because her accent and mannerisms seemed off.  Since I am an American, perhaps it was my ear that was off, but the whole thing came across so contrived and overdone that it was distracting.  Also, the weight Renee gained for this role looked unnatural on her, and I kept wishing that the lead character was someone who was truly British and naturally plump.  There are plenty of fat girls who are very beautiful because their faces and bodies are meant to be round and soft.  Rene's natural rock-hard fitness just didn't translate well, and instead of coming off as an ordinary overweight girl, she looked hard, ill, and bloated - It reminded me of the \""cockroach man\"" in MEN IN BLACK.  Very distasteful.  What in the world would have been so bad about hiring a real, live, pretty, plus sized English actress to play this role?  Was it actually necessary to find a skinny actress and pay her to pack on a bunch of pounds?

US,12028923,RIRIXR8JTOFXJ,B005W5L38G,998250483,Lichgates: Book One of the Grimoire Saga (an Epic Fantasy Adventure),Digital_Ebook_Purchase,5,4,6,False,True,Review: The Grimoire - Lichgates by S.M. Boyce,"The Grimoire: Lichgates is the first book in The Grimoire Trilogy. In this first book the author, S.M. Boyce, throws Kara (the main character) and the reader into an entirely new work called Ourea. To get to this world, Lichgates are necessary. They are portals linking our world to the dangerous, yet beautiful, kingdoms of Ourea. They are scattered all over both worlds and it is through one of them in the Rocky Mountains that Kara stumbles.<br /><br />Upon falling into an underground library, Kara finds waiting for her an old red leather book. The book is very magical. On it is a necklace with a pendant that looks like four crescent moons configured in the shape of a four-leaf clover. This book is so magical that there are blank pages throughout, but when asked the right questions the pages flip to sections and words appear with an answer.<br /><br />This book is one of Kara's only defenses against what lies in wait for her in Ourea. Upon opening the book, she has become the center of every kingdom's focus; she is the Vagabond. Her purpose in this strange world is to reunite the four kingdoms in peace, fulfilling the goal of the first Vagabond who died a thousand years before.<br /><br />This concept really caught me from the beginning. Like I said I was hooked from reading the first chapter alone. It takes a lot to do that with most books. Part of what kept me reading was the fact that this book doesn't wait to get the reader into the action. There is no lead in chapters, no foreshadowing, no mercy. Kara is hiking one minute and in Ourea fighting for her life the next. Every time throughout the book it seems that there will be some time to relax (for the characters and readers alike) something happens. It's almost impossible to put this book down. Lucky for me I was able to force the book down, which allowed me to savor every experience it held; there are many.<br /><br />I loved many elements of this book. First off, the setting made me want to visit Ourea. I know this is impossible (not only because it's not a real place) because if I went there, I'd most likely die (more on that soon.) Ourea is like the worlds of most fantastical stories. It has its beautiful landscapes, luxurious castles, and even a dreary kingdom no one wants to acknowledge. Its landscapes include forests, a kingdom nestled on top of a vertigo inducing multi mile high cliff, and even a kingdom found in a magical dome on the bottom of an ocean guarded by sharks. And it's not just the places themselves that I fell in love with, it's the way Boyce's words describe them. I can't do it justice in my own words, you'll have to take my word for it or read the book. Her words paint a picture of every aspect allowing the reader to soak in the images.<br /><br />The setting wasn't the only exciting part of the book. There are also the various creatures of the land. To mention a few there are griffins, dragons, something Kara says is similar to a squirrel, and one of my favorites a flaer named Rowthe. I liked him a lot because he's a huge dog like creature. Of course he has a unique ability, but I'm going to let you find that one out, it's just really cool.<br /><br />The characters Kara encounters are very hard to figure out. This helps the story be what it is more than anything else. The Grimoire from the beginning warns Kara that she can't trust anyone in Ourea. A lot of the times it seems like the characters can be figured out and trusted, but then there's either a subtle or drastic hint to the contrary. As a reader I was always jumping to conclusions about a character only to change my opinion soon after. I'm still waiting for a character to make a turn for the worse, but we'll see if that happens.<br /><br />Kara's journey takes the reader all over Ourea and she meets a variety of good and evil. She even has encounters with the evil King, Blood Carden. He is the father of Kara's companion Braeden. I guess I should have mentioned him by now.

But this was a while ago and I don't have the time or patience to go back and re-read for the sake of this review (so NO SPOILERS HERE!). I was just browsing some of my fav authors looking for any new or upcoming releases and was SHOCKED at the distribution of stars for this one. Then when I looked at all the reviews I noticed a trend....PEOPLE HATED THE ENDING!!! Well, let me add my own impression of it and for those of you who have not yet read this series or just this final installment hopefully I can give you a helpful opinion. If you're hoping the story will be wrapped up in a nice neat little package, and you've read any of the other reviews you don't need me to tell you, you will be disappointed! But if you are willing to keep your mind open, and get over expecting a \""happily ever after\"" ending, then I think you will really enjoy the ending to this series. I admit I love having my favorite characters finally get everything they have struggled for. Especially after following them through their challenges and lessons and being with them through it all you hope to also be there with them when it all gets resolved and you can join them in an endless bliss. On the other hand, it can also be very fun and interesting to have joined them to take a ride along on a very significant part of their story and leave them not necessarily knowing what is going to happen next. But at least you know that when you left them there was an optimism there, despite the troubles ahead. There was still some resolution at the \""end\"" of this story, it just wasn't the end of the ENTIRE story. And maybe that story will never be completed by someone else, but we can speculate on our own well enough. And to be frank, it was an exciting and surprising adventure and worth the time and dedication. I may have been a little disappointed with some aspects of the ending, but I would also have called b.s. on seeing realistic characters do everything right! I think the other reviewers here were let down because they didn't see this end up the way they wanted to, but if you ask me if a story ends up not only the way you want it to but any way you could have predicted then that's just bad writing! If you've read the previous installments, follow it through to the end. If you haven't and the reviews for this book are discouraging you, DON'T LET THEM! I completely fell into this series and loved it. It may not be for everyone, who am I or anyone to say. What I can say was I at least found this story quite unique and engaging and entertaining from beginning to end. Would I have liked to see more of the story, of course! And I think that's what upsets so many others, that there won't be more. What do you think that reaction says?",2012-08-15,532,extra_long,2012-08,ebooks

She loses her father, the only person she had left in her life. Despite him being a game-loving drunk, she still felt respect for him because of the hard life he had to endure. The major decision were always made by father, and now alone, Neryn faces hard decisions. Not really having a home to go to since she and her father have been vagrants for the past couple of years, she does the only thing she can think of--she flees. Believing her father's death was her fault because the King's men have been scrounging the kingdom of Alban looking for her because of her magical gift, she sets out to find Shadowfell, a place that is rumored to house Rebels against King Kaldec's tyranny.<br /><br />The road Neryn chooses is difficult one since the weather is turning cold and the paths are treacherous. I have to admire her courage and her dedication to get to her desired destination. She has no proof whatsoever that Shadowfell exists, but her belief in her late brother's stories keep her going. As she makes her way north, she encounters many problems on the road, almost as if she's being tested. Her canny gift for seeing fairy-like creatures called the Good Folk helps her quite often as they offer guidance and assistance. I think this is where the author's strengths are--in building a creative world full of creatures and myth. The world building is spectacular and I strongly believe that it makes the book stand on it's own.<br /><br />As far as characters go, some of them were exceptional. While I didn't care overmuch for Neryn, the little Good Folk she sees are very loveable. The way the author describes them as fey-like adds mysticism and magic to the story. Their physical descriptions were perfect, because while not too many details were given, each one of them was singled out by having animal-like or nature-like qualities of their own. Because of their hesitancy to be around humans, they weren't a constant presence in the story, which I think added so much mystery to their race. My favorite character is Flint, a stranger who is trying to help Neryn find Shadowfell. While I hate his secrecy and his refusal to share anything with Neryn, his dedication to her welfare and to her quest is admirable. We learn more about him later in the book so I'm not going to reveal too much and ruin the story, however, I will mention that his constant sacrifices for a better kingdom makes him a hero in my eyes. The romantic relationship that we see develop between him and Neryn at the end of the book is one of the things that didn't agree with me. To have Neryn hate him with a passion because of who he works for and because of the type of canny gift he possesses, and then a few pages later have her more or less declare her love for him simply made it hard for me to believe in their relationship. The relationship could have felt more natural if more time would have been dedicated to the romance plot.<br /><br />I strongly believe that SHADOWFELL has the foundation for a good YA fantasy but for some reason, it didn't amaze me the way I thought it would. Like I mentioned previously, the world building was wonderful and the characters were very likable. But I think the book lacked flow and motion to keep the story going. The whole book was more or less Neryn making her way to Shadowfell, sometimes alone, sometimes with Flint, and never really sure if she should trust him. The repetition of Neryn's inner thoughts and the stories of her past prevented the story from really taking off. The book felt like an introduction to a great fantasy world but left me looking for the rest of the story.<br /><br />¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨<br />An electronic advance reader's copy was provided by the publisher.humans, they weren't a constant presence in the story, which I think added so much mystery to their race.

(exactly . . .),"I've just listened to the sample tracks here and my first, overriding impression of this work is that it is NOT VYSOTSKY! That statement requires some clarification: the last track, entitled \""A Spellbound World\"", seems to be actually none other than Vladimir Vysotsky's 1974-1974 Paris recorded version of 'Liricheskaya'. The other tracks here are recordings of George Tokarev's translations of various of Vysotsky's songs performed by Michael Ohlsson. It is true that Vladimir Vysotsky - the \""Soviet Bard\"" - is such a huge talent, as a songwriter as well as singer and actor, that his presence can tend to drown out that of the various artists who interpret his work; nevertheless, it should be clear to casual listeners that what is on offer here is not the authentic recorded output of Vysotsky but something like a tribute album. Additionally, the musical arrangements are such as to more or less be more \""inspired by\"" the originals rather than actual performances of them. The songs' structures have been completely changed, in some cases beyond all recognition. That being said, there is clearly something of the essence of Vysotsky's artistry coming through these interesting, heavy-metal-inspired versions and George Tokarev's English verse translations, on which these songs are based, do also have some independent merit that may be of interest to the Vysotsky connoisseur.

Not because the modern setting put me off, but because I didn't want to get invested in another BBC import (I'm looking at you Doctor Who). But, I kept hearing wonderful things about it so I figured I'd give the free Amazon Prime Video a whirl. I'm so glad I did! This Sherlock has been my favorite adaptation, by far. Holmes always used any and every method of technology available to him, so why not texting, the internet, and the like? Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss (Executive Producers, writers, and all-around Sherlockian fanboys) have done a wonderful job adapting the stories and putting them in a modern context.<br /><br />Now, to address a few of the issues I've read in other reviews. Yes, it is only 3 episodes per season. I know Americans (me included) tend to be spoiled by 22 episode seasons, but let me tell you they do a lot with 4.5 hours! Each episode is like a movie (a fact that Gatiss and Moffat are quick to remind us) and you can tell a tremendous amount of work goes into making them. Yes, it is a seriously small season, but I feel the quality/quantity tradeoff makes a world of difference.<br /><br />Next, there is Sherlock himself. Yes, he's kind of a ass- well there's no kind of about it, really. He was written that way, plus we're meeting him at the same time John is. John hasn't become his social barometer yet, so he's at his prickly finest when we first meet him in the St. Bart's morgue. It's actually one of the things I love about this series. We see Sherlock grow and change as his friendship with John develops. He's always the smartest person in the room and sees that as license to say what he wants with no regard for anyone else. John is able to shape the behavior without yelling at him and calling him a freak as so many others do. The \""a bit not good, yeah.\"" moment was lovely to see when Sherlock realizes he may have said something inappropriate.<br /><br />Overall I would say give this a chance.

This game is played through 'Steam' and was priced at $24.99 at the time of writing this review.<br />Although only 2 episodes are available at present, the game will have a total of 5 segments when finished.<br /><br />This is an cartoon-like animated 3rd person adventure, You take the part of a federal prisoner, Lee, who escapes custody from a crashed patrol car. The story begins as he finds various people, some friends; some foes (all with various personalities) to align with in order to try to survive the land overrun with zombies.<br /><br />Some thoughts on \""The Walking Dead\""...<br /><br />The Pros:<br />1.) although a little different than the TV series, some of the characters and their names are the same as in the series. Some of the scenarios are similar with some slight variation.<br /><br />2.a) this is an interactive game... decisions that you make have a direct bearing on how the rest of your game unfolds. For example, you'll find you have to decide who to save from between two people, who to give food to, even to kill uninfected humans in certain situations etc. Also, other characters remember your decisions and how it affected them.<br />2.b) life and death decisions must be made within a few seconds... adding to the adrenalin pumping intensity. (See Cons: 2b below)<br />2.c) making decisions gives the game a legitimate replay value... you could make different choices in another run through to see how it would change the game.<br /><br />3.) graphic and very violent at times. Hard not to become involved with the action scenes.<br /><br />4.) well done shading and facial expressions of the cell characters. (See Cons: 4 below)<br /><br />5.) each episode is fairly short with a playing time of maybe 2 - 3 hours.<br />Probably the perfect length for completing an episode in one sitting.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />1.a) slow... very,very slow when your inbetween the 'action' segments as there were a lot of very quiet walking/talking scenes. These were used to develop the story and also to provide some character traits and personalities. But to me, it just seemed these scenes were dragged out...  a little too much drama vs. action... maybe an 80:20 ratio.<br />1.b) unfortunately, there was no way of bypassing or speeding-up some of these scenes if you died and had to repeat them.<br /><br />2.) game play...<br />a.) poor instructions<br />b.) point and click game play can be VERY frustrating at times.

While some other reviewers here have criticized the pacing, I didn't have a problem with it. As long as I'm into the characters, I don't mind how long a story takes to unfold, and I was engrossed by the people in this film.  It's something of a hybrid film, a gritty British gangster movie that slowly morphs into something more horrific. Nearly every element of the production is fantastic, from the acting to the score to the cinematography. It is shockingly violent at times, at other moments thrilling, and, surprisingly, quite funny upon occasion.  What gives me pause is the writing. It isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination: the characters are fully fleshed out, the story is compelling, and everything moves along nicely. Where the trouble comes is in the ending. You might have heard some buzz about it being a shocker, and it sort of was. Part of the reason for that, though, is because it receives the faintest wisp of a set up in all the story's prior events. While I certainly felt the movie was building up to something akin to what the ending was, and I recognized moments when clues were being dropped, I was never able to put them together.  As the credits rolled, I wished the theater would start the film again from the beginning, so that I could apply my newfound knowledge to the same scenes I had just witnessed and possibly make more sense of the whole thing. I believe a second viewing would help me answer the question:  Was this film pretty great? A nasty little genre thriller, clever in how it sets itself up, never holding the audience's hand too tightly? Or was it a noble failure, a movie with many great qualities taken on their own but which fail to add up to a satisfying whole because of an underwritten story?  I strongly recommend giving Kill List a shot. It's a captivating movie, regardless of how you feel about how it wraps up. I will certainly be paying attention to Ben Wheatley's future endeavors after viewing the talent on display in this film.",2012-02-07,368,long,2012-02,videos

He initially created the BTAP e-zine as a way to present well written stories that recalled the old traditional pulp adventures and now there is also a series of books that compile even more of these same great stories.  I came across the series while exploring more pulp and noir reading, after finishing 8 Pounds by Chris Holm and I'm very glad I took the chance and got myself a copy of Beat to a Pulp: Superhero.<br /><br />This volume, edited by Cranmer and Scott D.Parker doesn't just deal with the traditional \""superhero\""; as a matter of fact, most of the stories deal with ordinary people rising to the occasion and doing heroic things.  So while not exactly what I was expecting, given the title, the excellence of the stories was very much what I  was expecting and I found myself enjoying this anthology very much.<br /><br />There are thirteen tales in this volume; I will highlight my favorites:<br /><br />The collection kicks off with a firecracker of an introduction by Parker that really sets up the tone and theme of the book.<br /><br />Jake Hinkson's The Long Drop places superheroes squarely inside the New York City police department.  Cooper, a NYPD officer, wakes up in a hotel room, with no memory of how he got there or why there is a severed head in the shower.  Hinson introduces a gritty, alternate reality that I'd like to see him explore further, where people with super powers have been accepted in society and builds the tension nicely as Cooper tries to unravel the mystery of who has set him up and why...<br /><br />The Revenge of the Red Avenger called to mind the innocent kids from Stand By Me and The Sandlot; Billy and Carole are just a young boy and girl who are best friends and share a love of comic books.  They decide to become heroes, like the ones in  their comics, so they can find and fight crime in their neighborhood. Kevin Burton Smith packs an emotional wallop with this story, turning a tale of carefree innocence into one of tragedy with a powerful climax.<br /><br />The femme fatale of the group, Sandra Seamans, also presents an emotional story with Moon Mad.  Molly hides from the moon at night, safely amongst the nooks and crannies of the city, because the moon brings her bad \""dreams\"".  Then one night, Molly's memories won't be denied and she has to relive a terrible past in order to save a group of innocent girls.  Seamans made me care very much about Molly and while I guessed the ending, it was no less sad for me when the story was over.<br /><br />Benoit Lelievre gives us Doberman: Third Party Law Enforcement and introduces us to a mercenary called upon by a politician to save his twin sons from a madman.  The story is just the right amount of violent and the protagonist reminded me of in some ways of Frank Castle, the Punisher.  Lelievre writes a dark story and I hope he chronicles more of the Doberman's adventures.<br /><br />And finally, to round out my list of favorites, is Chad Eagleton's Somewhere Beyond the Pavement.  It is another tale of young kids finding themselves in dire circumstances and having to find the inner strength to fight.  To live.  The way Eagleton writes the story, switching from the children, to their father, to the villains and back again really creates a thrilling edge-of-your-seat story and a made it my favorite entry in the collection.<br /><br />I enjoyed this collection very much and will definitely be seeking out more from the BTAP series, as well as other works from the individual authors.  It is a great collection, and each story is was highly readable; there wasn't a clunker in the bunch.  You can get Beat To A Pulp: Superhero here and when you do, plan on reading this action packed volume in just one sitting, it's that good!<br /><br />Happy reading!lop with this story, turning a tale of carefree innocence into one of tragedy with a powerful climax.<br /><br />The femme fatale of the group, Sandra Seamans, also presents an emotional story with Moon Mad.

I have used TurboTax (and MacinTax - the Mac version from the 1990's before they renamed it TurboTax) every year.  Last year, I tried H&R Block's software, but quickly returned it and bought TurboTax.  There is no equivalent to TurboTax on the market.<br /><br />The Good: As usual, TurboTax is relatively error-free (as far as I could tell) and easy to use.  One can use the walk-through step-by-step approach in which TurboTax leads you through everything step by step.  Or, if one wants to just fill out the forms, one can go into forms mode and enter the information that way - a bit quicker since TurboTax does need to cover areas that are irrelevant to one's situation in the step-by=step method.<br /><br />I purchased mine early so I could get a head start on my taxes.  One can estimate figures (marking them for future review/correction) and can make itemized lists that are totaled up and entered in the appropriate blocks - great for listing the details of any figures added to the forms.  When adding a state form, it is so quick and easy to fill out.  One can file (I think) five or ten federal returns for free - great feature for a family of teenagers who work.<br /><br />The description pretty much covers all of the capabilities.  Hands down, this is a much better program than H&R Block, which was very buggy - itemized lists could not be modified, the right forms would not come up when selected...you can see the list of bugs in my evaluation of H&R Block's software last year (I have no reason to believe it will be any better this year).<br /><br />Now, the Bad:  I have only one complaint - pricing.  The software is a bit expensive, but that is understandable since this is a very comprehensive and non-buggy program compared to the other one.  But the ancillary costs are too much.  The first state is free (with TurboTax Deluxe), but the others are $39.95 each.  As a family that moved in the middle of last year, I needed two state packages.  Also, to file the state forms, it costs $19.95 per state per return.  So for my family, which includes three teenagers and a military move, it would cost me an extra $239.45 to file the returns (five people, two states plus the cost of downloading the second state).  This is quite expensive, especially considering the minimal income that my teenagers received.  The way around this, of course, is to print the state tax returns and mail them in.  It still cost me $39.95 for the download of the second state, which I thought was a bit much since I already paid for TurboTax Deluxe, but it wasn't unpalatable.  However, for $39.95, I would think the state return should be filed for free, not for an additional $19.95 per return.  Changing Intuit's policy to provide free state e-files for the states that are purchased separately would be a reasonable and good business practice.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very good program.  I have been using it yearly since the 1990's.  Every time I stray to a different company, I come running back to TurboTax.  Save yourself the grief of poor quality, bug-ridden software and just stick to TurboTax.<br /><br />r/Jim",2012-03-11,562,extra_long,2012-03,software

The gameplay is straightforward and logical; you won't be asking yourself \""what do I do next?\"" very often. The hidden object scenes are clear and the objects big enough that you won't need a magnifying glass to find them. The mini games are mostly easy, some ridiculously so.<br /><br />But to me, it appeared as if this game was cobbled together from discarded concept scenes from other games. This seems to be borne out by the fact that the first half takes place in the amusement park and then you suddenly jump through a portal into a surreal world that's dominated for some reason by a windmill motif. You can't even credit the game developers with a strange form of originality for this turn of events as the alternate world is jam packed with tasks and locations that you've seen in every other game. In fact, I would almost swear that parts of some of the scenes I have actually seen in other games.<br /><br />Now anyone who has played a certain number of HOGs would argue that there is a lot of repetition in concept and tasks when it comes to these games. But the better games can twist even the most familiar narrative and add something interesting to the mix, whether a unique variation to some of the mini games or even just employing a striking drawing style. This game is just sort of lifeless. I also think that the abandoned amusement park theme hasn't been visited THAT many times, as in contrast to the mental asylum or haunted house themes, so there is plenty of opportunity for original material here, which unfortunately was wasted.<br /><br />Further evidence that Weird Park: Broken Tune was a bit of an afterthought is that you are provided a journal, but it is barely updated. Towards the end of the game it is all but discarded. The locations are limited, and I would guess that is why you have to play some of the HOG scenes not twice, but three times.<br /><br />There is a plot involving playing a detective who must search the abandoned park looking for a journalist; the conclusion kind of makes sense. A demon sprite and an evil clown are the main characters. I did get a laugh when one of the characters turns out to be a total coward and literally runs out of the game.<br /><br />Lastly, there is a problem with the hint button that is represented in the game by a forlorn organ grinding monkey with a thousand yard stare. The problem is that it doesn't seem to work very well. The button responded when I pressed it, but did not actually show where the hidden object was, it just reset itself. I tried it a couple of more times in different scenes just to confirm there was a problem, and only once did a circle appear around the object. I checked around the gaming sites to see if I was the only one with this issue, and I wasn't. This may have been corrected since the game first came out, but is something to bear in mind, though there are at least two walkthroughs of the game out there to consult if need be. IMO, you will not have to resort to using the hint button very much any way.<br /><br />To end on a positive note, I would say that this game is good for HOG beginners. Frequent players won't hate it, but might be disappointed. My alternative pick for a satisfying amusement park themed game would be Dreamland, also available on Amazon.",2012-01-13,610,extra_long,2012-01,games

Felt a bit too linear at times but the cutscenes and dialogue and storyline are pretty engaging.<br />-Spec Ops mode, for when you just feel like challenging yourself.<br />-A bit more realistic than the other COD series, where you could get hit 5 times up close and not die. In this game, you can die in 3 pistol bullets at close range. Makes for a challenging and highly rewarding experience.<br />-Perks are a bit more balanced than in MW2.<br /><br />Let's move onto the bad things about this game. Just to let you know I'm a huge COD fan AND a BF3 fan, but I'll do my best to review this from a COD player's perspective and leave BF3 to a Battlefielder's perspective.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Hackers. Hackers, hackers, hackers. This is especially problematic on PC. You'd think a perm IP ban on steam might scare these guys away, but nope. I've consistently seen level 50+ players using aimbots and locking on/following players through walls... players like me who use Asssassin Pro and Dead Silence and silenced weapons.<br /><br />-Lag. Delay in registry makes for some pretty disgusting hitmarker moments. Since it's peer2peer based connection instead of dedicated server connection, host migration gets really annoying. If the host lives on Mars or some remote galaxy and has terrible internet connection, you're better off leaving the match and joining another game rather than risking extreme teleportation/death due to warping players whom you can't even hit because they're rubberbanding so hard.<br /><br/>-80% of the maps suck. The only decent maps are Terminal, Mission, Village, and Dome. I'm not sure what the developers were thinking when they were making the maps, because some of them are just disgusting and downright terrible - full of ridiculous camping spots and overall not a pleasure to play.<br /><br />-Copies over a lot of the weapons from MW2. Hence, the affectionate nickname COD:MW2.5. P90, .44 Magnum, M16A4, ACR, UMP, AA-12, SPAS-12, Barrett .50 Cal, Dragunov, USP, and Desert Eagle just to name a few. And they're almost the exact same in terms of weapon firing and reloading/swapping animations. Funny how you pay $60 for a game with a ton of brand new weapons (MW2) and then you have to pay $60 again for a game that copies over half the guns of its predecessor.<br /><br />-Shotguns are too underpowered and take too much patience/effort to unlock the range/damage proficiencies. I'm talking mostly the KSG-12, SPAS-12, and M1887. Only time they kill in one hit is within tactical knife range. Even then I've had hitmarkers with them using damage proficiency at point blank range despite my entire crosshair being over their torso. Takes three 12 gauge shotshell rounds to kill someone at 10m but only three 9mm pistol rounds at the same range -> Sledgehammer games logic.<br /><br />-Overpowered guns: Akimbo FMG's can and will snipe you from halfway across the map, not just once but multiple times. Obviously because 9mm rounds are just that powerful and accurate. Dunno why they decided to make guns so d@mn powerful in this game. Type 95 is also another classic... not used as often since the follow up bursts are slow but you really need only 1 burst at close to medium range. Yes, Infinity Ward... a 5.8mm chinese round from a Type 95 has more damage than a 7.62x51mm NATO round from a CM901. Makes sense. Oh and ACR 6.8 and MP7... don't even get me started. They render half the assault rifles and submachine guns useless. Anyone who uses any of the above guns really isn't interested in playing the game for fun.<br /><br />-Spawns. Are really bad. Every match I spawn in front of an enemy at least two times.<br /><br />-Killstreaks. Are really, really overpowered. If the enemy has a UAV missile drone/chopper/AC-130/Osprey gunner it's pretty much over.<br /><br />-Matchmaking system. If you leave a room because the map sucked or there was a hacker, chances are, if you pick the same mode, you'll be put into that same room again. Like seriously?<br /><br />-No votekick. If there's a hacker in the room, best bet is to report him through steam and then leave and pick another game mode to play.<br /><br />Don't buy this game. Wait for black ops 2. I heard they're actually using new guns and a decent map system plus dedicated servers.

Each section is mostly straight forward, however I kept the manual open on my desktop and looked up a few things here and there as I was editing.<br /><br />I was able to take about  an hour of AVCHD video (as five separate clips), trim them, adjusted their quality, put them in sequence with transitions into the timeline, as well as a good title (with soundtrack behind the title) in about 1.5 hours from the point of downloading the software.  That's pretty impressive.<br /><br />For those new to editing, I would recommend keeping your project to a couple of clips totaling 10 minutes or less.<br /><br />I was able to consult the very well written manual that helped me find what I need. I have some previous experience editing experience from about a decade ago (but mostly forgotten), so I would think most people could produce a simple video using the basic capabilities of the software in an hour to a couple of hours, depending on your computer skills, any previous editing experience, length of the video, number of clips, and how many tricks you want to throw at it.<br /><br />The nice thing about Pro X5 is that it's simple software gives you the impression this is just a simple editor.  However if you consult the manual there is tons of functionality to explore.  Just about everything you'd want to do can be done by this editor.  Unless you have real pro aspirations (and want to spend a lot of time figuring out why you messed up your timeline) this is the way to go.<br /><br />The video editor is stable.  I'm using Windows 7 on a desktop with a quad core AMD processor, four gigabytes of memory and an average video card by 2012 standards.  I'm able to render and burn a one hour length program on DVD in an hour and forty-five minutes using a slow DVD burner (pretty impressive).<br /><br />If you want a well thought out, stable video editor, that has lots more options should you choose to explore them later, then get this software.  I downloaded several other 30 day trials by the big names, and this product clearly stands out on top for ease of use, functionality and stability!",2012-03-10,499,long,2012-03,software

If these instructions are there, then I clearly missed them.<br /><br />However, I'd like to make it easy for people who are downloading this software, to save themselves the trouble I was able to eventually figure out.<br /><br />I don't know if this is the same thing as when you download directly from Poser's \""Smith Micro's\"" website, but if it does the same with those download packages, then hopefully through some word search, you've found this solution and it likewise works for you.<br /><br />Before we begin, there's a quick 4 step process listed below all this much more detailed version of what to do and the explanation of this problem. If you're pretty computer savvy and not too interested in what's going on, just go to the bottom and read the 4 steps of instructions there.<br /><br />For those more interested in the detail, here's what kept happening to me.<br /><br />I purchased the downloadable version of Poser Pro 2012 from Amazon.com. I began my download, using the amazon poser pro downloader that takes a few mins to download, and that upon running, starts the actual download of Poser. Prepare to allow the better part of the whole day to download this program as Poser is quite sizable.<br /><br />For me it automatically set up a folder for all the zipped / downloaded files to go to on my desktop.<br /><br />**********HERE'S WHERE I WILL SAVE YOU A LOT OF TROUBLE**********<br /><br />After a whole day or so of downloading, you now have that folder that automatically set up on your desktop sitting there.<br /><br />Your first step is to UNZIP / EXPAND / EXTRACT, (however you want to say it) all the zipped folders. If I'm not mistaken, there should be 9 of them, and they are as follows:<br /><br />PoserPro2012Animals<br />PoserPro2012CartoonFantasyFigures<br />PoserPro2012Clothing<br />PoserPro2012Hair<br />PoserPro2012Installer<br />PoserPro2012NudeFigures<br />PoserPro2012PropsScenery<br />PoserPro2012QueueManager2012Installer<br />PoserPro2012ReferenceFigures<br /><br />So, right click each of these and Unzip or Extract them all. I would recommend for the sake of not making it confusing, to keep them in the same folder your zipped versions are in.<br /><br />NOW, ONCE YOU'VE UNZIPPED / EXTRACTED ALL FOLDERS, IF YOU GO INTO THE \""PoserPro2012Installer\"" FOLDER, AND CLICK THE \""Install Poser Pro 2012\"" RED EXECUTABLE FILE, IT'S GOING TO INSTALL THE PROGRAM AND LEAVE BEHIND ALL THESE LIBRARIES THAT COME WITH YOUR SOFTWARE, LEAVING YOUR INSTALLATION INCOMPLETE AND YOU UNABLE TO USE THEM.<br /><br />It will give you a few options such as folder directories etc, and after making your selections, begin installing the program.<br /><br />Everything seems kosher, and a green progress bar shows the program as installing everything to the end. However, after reaching the end and waiting for about 15 seconds to half a minute or so, error messages start popping up, and read like the following:<br /><br />\""The installer executable for a selected content package was not found in this installer's source directory<br />C:Users [your computer's name ] DesktopPoser Pro 2012PoserPro2012InstallerContentPoserHair.exe<br /><br />note that for each content package, it displays one of these error boxes, every time you click \""Ok\"" and the \""PoserHair.exe\"" is just one of 8 of these. But actually, the \""Animals\"" content package is the first one that pops up of the error messages, since it's alphabetically trying to run each executable in order.<br /><br />After one of these incomplete installations, you'll still be able to run and use Poser, only it's going to be missing a vast amount of content and libraries that make the programwhat it's supposed to be.<br /><br />It took me several attempts of uninstalling, reinstalling to figure out what was going on, but once I really stopped and read the message, it became very clear.<br /><br />Take another look at one of the 8 error messages I was receiving at the end of the installation. Note the error messages I displayed above, and pay attention to the directory it couldn't find the other executable files in.<br /><br />\""The installer executable for a selected content package was not found in this installer's source directory<br />C:Users [your computer's name ] DesktopPoser Pro 2012PoserPro2012InstallerContentPoserHair.exe<br /><br />On the last line above that appears on these error messages, you see ......Content...<br /><br />\""Content\"" is what I want you to notice and pay attention to.<br /><br />If you, like myself, have already had this problem at the end of your installation, then you might notice upon reading the error windows that pop up at the end of your incomplete installation, that it's looking for, and EXPECTING these other executable files (such as the \""...Hair or ...Animals\"" files) -for these libraries and content to be in this \""Content\"" folder.<br /><br />However, it's not finding any of these files and installing the rest of the additional program content and libraries, because this \""Content\"" folder doesn't exist, and thus these other executable files have not yet been placed in it. Hence the 8 \""error messages\"" at the end of your installation that leaves out so much of the content and libraries that came with your program.<br /><br />The problem going on upon this incomplete installation, is that it wants to run these files, and install the additional content that comes with each of them, but the installer is looking for them to be in \""Content\"" folder, and EXPECTING them to be in the proper directory above. (by \""directory\"", I mean the sequential order of folders within folders)<br /><br />SO, WE MUST MANUALLY CREATE THIS NEW FOLDER IN THE PROPER LOCATION, AND LIKEWISE MANUALLY PLACE EACH EXECUTABLE FILE INTO THIS FOLDER, SO THAT UPON INSTALLATION, THE INSTALLER CAN FIND IT AND LIKEWISE INSTALL ALL THIS ADDITIONAL CONTENT AND LIBRARIES.<br /><br />SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO...<br /><br />AFTER YOU'VE UNZIPPED ALL FOLDERS (AND HOPEFULLY LEFT THEM IN THE DEFAULT FOLDER THAT WAS AUTOMATICALLY CREATED ON YOUR DESKTOP UPON YOUR DOWNLOAD) YOU NEED TO MANUALLY CREATE THE \""CONTENT\"" FOLDER IN THE EXACT SAME DIRECTORY THAT'S APPEARING IN THESE ERROR MESSAGES,<br /><br />To do this, double click and go into the now unzipped / extracted version of the folder, \""PoserPro2012Installer\""<br /><br />You should see that little red icon / executable file that says \""Install Poser Pro 2012\"". DO NOT OPEN / DOUBLE CLICK OR ACTIVATE THIS FILE YET.<br /><br />Instead, right click anywhere within the empty space around the folder and on the pop-up menu that comes up, scroll your mouse down to \""New\"" and then click on \""Folder\"" on the new sub-menu that also pops up.<br /><br />Now, rename that new folder you just created \""Content\"" and make sure you spell it correctly.<br /><br />So now that you've created this new \""Content\"" folder, INSIDE THE \""PoserPro2012Installer\"" folder, YOU NOW NEED TO GO THROUGH EACH OF THE OTHER UNZIPPED / EXTRACTED VERSIONS OF THE FOLDERS LISTED ABOVE, AND BRING EACH EXECUTABLE FILE FOUND IN THOSE FOLDERS, AND PLACE THEM IN THE NEW \""Content\"" folder you just created.<br /><br />To do this, start with your first folder, \""PoserPro2012Animals\"". Double click it, and once inside that folder, right click on the red \""PoserAnimals\"" file. When you right click this file, select \""Cut\"" about half way down the menu that pops up.<br /><br />Back click out of that folder, (upper left arrows) until you see the folder holding the \""PoserPro2012Installer\"" folder, along with all your other zipped/unzipped folders.<br /><br />Open up / double click the same \""...Installer\"" folder, and once inside, open up / doubleclick the \""Content\"" folder.<br /><br />Right click in the blank area of that folder, and select \""Paste\""<br /><br />REPEAT THIS PROCESS FOR EACH AND EVERY EXECUTABLE FILE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FOLDERS.<br /><br />There should be 8 folders each with their own red executable file you have to do this for, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE THE \""Install Poser Pro 2012\"" executable to this \""Content\"" folder. Just leave it in it's natural spot within the \""PoserPro2012Installer\"" folder.<br /><br />Make sure you've properly done this for each of these other 8 folders and their respective executable files. (Go in, and right-click \""Cut\"" them out of their natural folders, and \""Paste\"" them inside the \""Content\"" folder)<br /><br />If you've done all these steps correctly, then here's what you should have:<br /><br />Inside the \""Poser Pro 2012\"" Folder that was automatically set up, and most likely on your desktop (other locations are fine as well) you should have:<br /><br />--Some files (3 or 4 or so) that hold keys, \""read me\"" instructions etc. (these have been here with your download so don't worry you didn't miss nothing)<br /><br />--Your zipped versions of the 9 folders listed above.<br /><br />--Your unzipped / extracted  version of the same 9 folders.<br /><br />Within the unzipped \""PoserPro2012Installer\"" folder, you should have:<br /><br />--A folder you created called \""Content\""<br /><br />--and below that a red executable file named \""Install Poser Pro 2012\""<br /><br />Within the \""Content\"" folder, you should now have all the other (8) executable files you took from each of the other folders listed above.<br /><br />They should be red icons and listed as follows:<br /><br />Install Queue Manager 2012<br />PoserAnimals<br />PoserCartoons<br />PoserCasual<br />PoserClothing<br />PoserHair<br />PoserNudes<br />PoserProps<br /><br />Note that the \""Install Poser Pro 2012\"" executable file found resting naturally in it's own location one folder back, does not need to be moved here.<br /><br />Now the installer will successfully find these other library and content packages it needs to give you all the bells and whistles of Poser Pro,<br /><br />so activate / open / double click the \""Install Poser Pro 2012\"" red icon resting inside the \""PoserPro2012Installer\"" and if you've done everything correctly, you should be good to go, and a hopefully complete version of the installation that includes all the additional content and libraries should take place.<br /><br />Hope this helps...<br /><br />**********HERE'S THE SHORT VERSION**********<br /><br />.. of how to make your installation a success without any of the problems I kept encountering<br /><br />(1) After successful installation of all content from Amazon, Unzip / Extract / Expand all 9 folders (listed above)<br /><br />(2) Go into the unzipped version of the \""PoserPro2012Installer\"" folder, and create a new folder inside it. MAKE SURE YOU NAME IT \""Content\"" without any misspelling, spaces, etc.<br /><br />(3) Go back into each of the other unzipped / extracted folder, and \""Cut\"" the red executable file from each, placing all 8 into the new \""Content\"" folder resting inside the \""PoserPro2012Installer\"" folder. (note, it's not \""9\"" because the red executable inside \""...Installer\"" folder, can and should be left alone)<br /><br />(4) After doing this with each unzipped folder and the executable file inside, now go back to the \""PoserPro2012Installer\"" folder, and click the \""Install Poser Pro 2012\"" button.",2012-08-27,1821,extra_long,2012-08,software

Movies that come to mind would be the Godfather Trilogy, Home Alone Trilogy, Jurrasic Park trilogy, Ninja Turtles, & even some with 4 parts such as House Party & Superman. Why is this an ongoing trend you ask? I really don't know honestly. Well the same format applies here to the X-men triology. The first 2 films were pretty good with the second one being the best out the three in my book. While the first 2 had its flaws this third 1 is a total train wreck & isn't even worthy of being its own seperate film let alone part of a trilogy! The story revolves around the government coming up with a \""cure\"" for mutants to permantely disable their powers or alien like physique so that the humans will be in favor. A good idea for a story but it didn't actually help to break off into a another story with Jean coming back from her alledged death from the second film & merging with pheonix. The latter story is just stupid for many reasons. For one, when will these movie directors/producers stop using insanely powerful heroes or villians in these movies? Pheonix in the comics is actually 20 times more powerful than depicted in this film so much more powerful that it was able to hold its own with a mid fed galactus. Also pheonix is a being from space who chose jean as a host it had nothing to do with her mind. & why would they kill off cyclops & professor x 2 prominent character in the x-men series? thats just plain retarded. I don't recall either of them getting killed off by jean in the comics rather transported to an alternate dimension or something but not killed off. Of course Magneto & his now much larger band of evil mutants are still at war with Prof x & the x-men as well as the human race. While attempting to Free Juggernaut & Multiple man from police custody (yeah picture juggernaut being held captive by police)one of the officers manages to shoot & inject Mystique with the \""cure\"" which results in here losing her mutand powers & blue streak appearance. Magneto then disowns her & seeks out Jean whos power is off the charts thanks to phoenix. When Magneto & his crew finally reach Jean they are also come face to face with the x-men in which a fight breaks out between Juggs & logan & Storm & one of magneto's newer mutant henchwomen. Speaking of Juggernaut, why are they disregarding the relationship of Prof X & Juggernaut? They're supposed to be step brothers with Juggernaut aka Cain Marko having a burning hatred for his brother yet they never even interact or acknowledge each other. Thats something simple they still managed to get wrong arghhhhhhh!<br /><br />Prof X & Magneto both try to win over Jean with her new found powers & she ends up killing the professor & going with Magneto. Now that Magneto has Jean on his side hes going to official strike at the human race only to have Jean get power hungry or something & turn on him & the other evil mutants making her the greater threat. Once again the x-men & magneto & his crew hunt down jean whos causing havoc in the city &. A Big showdown breaks out & Jean even ends up killing some of the mutants. Eventually Jean unleashes some surrounding energy that vaporizes anybody within reach so wolverine decides to take her down given his healing factor (yeah that'll happen).<br /><br />This Movie was just a big mess, 2 stories with rather confusing plotholes, alot of useless characters (why is rouge on here again? she completely sucks easily the worst adapotion I've seen of her character even worse then x-men evolution's version), & they disregard simple aspects that make up x-men storyline. They even leave out some of the characters from part 2 such as the ever loveable nightcrawler. wheres gambit? even sabertooth was absent here. One good thing I can say about this movie is Fraiser as the beast, he did an excellent job & the makeup looked well to.<br /><br />This movie would have went better if it had a story involving the Sentinels I mean they are a pretty important part of x-men but obvioulsy the film makers didn't think so.

They made ordinary console games like Rayman and Beyond Good and Evil, and no one really thought much about them otherwise. Fast forward to an era when game companies are all trying to figure out what to do about piracy, and Ubisoft has decided it wants to be the Demon King.   I will not claim this is a bad game in itself. It is, so far as I have been able to play, excellent. It is a vast improvement over its predecessors. Good graphics, nice music, clever animations, a fun overwrought story, and solid gameplay. Of course, I haven't been able to play very far, so for all I know it suffers from some of the balance issues of the previous game, but I don't know.   And why don't I know? DRM alone is not the reason. Oh, their DRM is ridiculous, to be sure. I purchased the game on Valve's Steam service, which is itself a form of DRM. I then have two product keys to work with (which Steam has kindly made easy to access with a hot-key into a Steam menu. Ubisoft wanted me to write them down). Alright, well, product keys are kind of 90's, but I can cope. But no, Ubisoft seems to feel that the key to combating piracy is much like the key to staying warm in winter - layers. So I've got another DRM to deal with, the UPlay \""service\"". Never mind that I already have a Steam account, I must create a UPlay account to launch the game the first time, even if I intend to opt for playing the crippled offline mode.   I can cope with the idea that offline mode wouldn't have achievements, it's a bit silly considering that my XBox 360 happily ticks off trophies even though it's not connected to the internet at all. But no, achievements are an online thing, like leaderboards. Fine. But why are all of the Dynasty extras online only? No Dynasty weapons, bonuses, or encyclopedia except in online mode. Even in the single player campaign! I paid for the things, why I can't I use them even if I don't want to use any inherently online features?   Moreover, while an offline mode is available, it isn't like I can choose to keep a backup copy of my game for playing offline. Games started online stay online. Offline games stay offline, and nary the twain shall meet. And online mode isn't a happy solution, unlike on Steam. Not only do I have limited saves (10 manual and 10 automatic), I have to deal with Ubisoft's unacceptable service standards.   They do not announce server downtime (a standard practice for...just about everyone else with online services). They do not provide a server status site. And if you launch the game and the server is down, you are informed there is something wrong with *your* connection. If you go to the support site, you navigate the mess to be told a number of complex ways it is your fault, and not a hint that it might be maintenance, or even unintentional downtime. The only way to know that it's a problem on their end is to go to the forum and find the newest thread with thousands of replies created in the last few hours complaining about not being able to connect. This is not a rare occurrence. One can skim the same forum to discover similar threads coinciding with holidays in particular, but on other days as well, with a frequency that is unacceptable even from free services, much less DRM I have apparently paid for.   I will never again purchase an Ubisoft title. I suggest you do the same.",2012-01-01,626,extra_long,2012-01,games

Nor is it exciting in other than a mesmerizing, ironically comical manner.  If you seek in a movie any of those qualities, this will not be your cup of tea.  Don't beat yourself up.  Social satire, like revenge, is a dish best served cold.  In other words, should you desire to sample this fare, go into it with a clear head and your eyes open.<br /><br />On the other hand, there may be those among us who might find it fascinating to watch, undetected, as four people with the best of intentions behave outrageously.  If so, this is your wicked, dark cup of espresso.  How can four parents, so determined to arrive at a consensual conclusion to a touchy matter of offspring misbehavior, leap so badly off track in a matter of minutes?  Simply confine them in a room, and allow them to be their most earnest, self absorbed, selves.  They are as above-average in their own estimation as any human being.  They (parents of \""perpetrator\"") are \""...very touched by how generous you're being.  We realize how you're trying to smooth things over.\""  (Parents of \""victim\"":) \""Please...it's the least we can do....(a few seconds later)...But he realizes he disfigured his schoolmate?\""  With regards to the boy's tooth, \""...apparently the nerve is not completely exposed...part of it is exposed...\""  Ah.

Scream, sob, rant, pummel, throw things, toss your cobbler if you must, but do not--I repeat, DO NOT--leave!<br /><br />Perhaps because it lacked the lightheartedness of many afarce,  the plot felt a bit contrived due to chronic incorrigibility and the \""not leaving\"".  (It was a completely dysfunctional \""Minnesota Goodbye\"".  Google it if you must.) Despite that, one of the more enjoyable aspects was the fun the actors seemed to be having underneath it all.  This was the most evident in Reilley and Waltz.  Winslet was very subtle with it, but Foster was a bit strained and intense for it to be quite as deliciously evil.  Maybe a bit more ebb and flow would have evened it out a bit in her case.  That said, all the portrayals were quite excellent in rising to the task of carrying the play to film.  It is simply well acted and directed.<br /><br />\""Look, we're all decent people, all four of us.  I don't know how we got so carried away losing our tempers.  It's totally unnecessary!\""<br /><br />\""Stop it, Michael!

I was first introduced to the band as they opened for another string-driven favorite of mine, Judgement Day in January of 2011. I have learned to not expect much from an opening band, and as such, I clearly remember standing with a beer in one hand and the other in my pocket, just waiting for the headliner. But this band. Oh, this band. Rarely in life do you get the experience of staring, mouth agape, as your entire world changes. In a single set, I became aware that THIS was what I wanted from music. No longer would I need a long stream of adjectives to describe what I wish a band had. Now I could just say, \""Listen to Exquisite Corps.\""<br /><br />Well, in theory. Until last week, there was no recorded music to share. I've seen the band perform more than a dozen times at this point, and each show brought another promise that the album would be \""coming soon!\"" And so I waited. And waited. At some point, showing my friends some poorly recorded YouTube videos just was not good enough. I eventually convinced myself that Exquisite Corps was just a live band. There was just no way their sound could be bottled into a lifeless stereo recording. I told myself this to cope with the fact that an album just may never come.<br /><br />I am now unbelievably happy to report that not only is there an album, but the magic that flows so freely from the band on stage has been miraculously contained in this short, seven song masterpiece. As a local, poor band (their words!), I feared that there was just no way to accurately portray the multi-layered string arrangements on a budget. Fortunately, it appears the band elected to record only a small selection of their songs so as to put as much care as possible into the recording and mixing process. The result is mesmerizing. Each string part, each pluck of an acoustic guitar, and each haunting vocal melody is crystal clear. With a proper set of headphones,you will easily be able to pick out each of the six instruments as they create layers of melody.<br /><br />Oh, and the songs are amazing, did I mention that? Sometimes haunting and ethereal, other times foot-stampingly triumphant, the album is both a fun distraction and a work that rewards multiple listens. At only 7 songs, it is clear they picked the tracks that would make the most cohesive album possible. Accordingly, this album is a mission statement. The tracks rise and fall beautifully over its 32 minute run time, somehow summarizing the sound of a band that previously defied description. While I miss many of my favorite live tracks (they do the best cover of Lou Reed's \""Street Hassle\"" you could ever hope to hear), the care put into this collection is enough to hold me over until they can afford to record again. However, even if this album was all that history retained of Exquisite Corps, it would be enough. In 32 minutes, they accomplish what so many other bands take multiple albums to not accomplish.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this album enough. While my primary recommendation would be to go see this band live, I doubt they'll be able to extend their touring radius until a few albums sell. In the mean time, you will find a sound unlike anything else with this album. For myself, it is enough that I can answer the timeless question of \""What kind of music are you into?\"" with \""Listen to Exquisite Corps.\""",2012-08-06,613,extra_long,2012-08,music

To spice it up, the story is set partly in Yemen, where a very wealthy Yemeni sheik wants to build a water project to create an agricultural base for his people, with a side benefit of salmon fishing for him.  The British government is at first an enthusiastic backer, what with 2,000,000 British anglers who vote and who are presumed to also like the idea; and for it's Middle Eastern theme with no explosions or death.  Unfortunately, it's going to take 10,000 salmon hatchlings and the fishermen go up in arms, so the only alternative is farmed salmon.  But will they run?  Will they migrate and establish a fishery?<br /><br />It turns out that, in the real world, farmed salmon do run.  A bit later as they first return to where they escaped or were released, then they miss the anglers who show up earlier to get the native fish, and then they screw up the spawning grounds by trying to lay their own eggs, so there's lots of emerging reasons not to farm salmon as we currently do, but that's not this film.  The point is, the fish DO run, they swim upstream and over the damn (and they swam and they swam right over the dam!).<br /><br />But this is a Western film, with Brits abroad, and it's set in Yemen and all we know about the Middle East is that there's a whole lot of terrorists over there, so that's the way the movie presents the Yemenis.  If they're not just standing around providing local color with their antiquated dress and weather sculpted faces, they're ordering assassinations, and trying to destroy things.  Don't ask why.  Don't consider whether it's our policies that might be causing this animosity, our treatment of the Arab on the street.  That isn't this movie, either.  Worse, the two British characters wander around in casual western wear, no more than one layer, nothing covering their arms or her head, just as if Yemen is a branch of Hyde park.  When she can't sleep, she comes out of  her tent in her pjs, then he comes out in his, and they sit next to each other.  No matter how this might outrage the locals in the real world, or get the Brits killed (it doesn't, the plot won't allow it).<br /><br />The movie is a rather simple romantic adventure, a boy and a girl join a rich sheik in his dream to bring salmon fishing to Yemen.  A few cranky old Arab terrorists and some cynical British politicians get in the way, but in the end &#34;Faith&#34; and Love triumph, and the salmon run.<br /><br />A lot of people thought this was an incredible film.",2012-12-05,528,extra_long,2012-12,videos

Instead, he's just a guy singing about the things that matter to him.

I'm sure as I listen to the others more they will grow on me.<br /><br />One thing that I've learned is never to take Billy's music for face value.

On 'Slaughterhouse,' his first album with his touring mates, that intense live energy is captured almost perfectly, at least for 29 of it's 39 minutes.<br /><br />Upon hearing the first track, \""Death,\"" my initial thought was, \""Wow, someone's been listening to Hawkwind recently!\"" In fact, the album as a whole has that late 60's, early 70's proto-metal vibe of bands like Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, and especially the heavy prog stylings of the aforementioned Hawkwind; only with the take-no-prisoners bombast of early punk progenitors The Stooges and MC5, and the DIY psychedelia of U.S. garage bands circa 1966 thrown in the mix. The result is an album that will make you want to headbang while at the same time make you want to spark one up and drift away to state of zoned-out bliss. \""Wave Goodbye\"" is a perfect example of this, with sludgy, skull-crushing guitars, a hypnotic repeating bass riff, and drums that sound like they're being pummeled into splinters. This doesn't sound like a recipe for \""zoned-out bliss,\"" but trust me, it is.<br /><br />The sound quality, as usual when it comes to Ty Segall, is extremely lo-fi, but that doesn't make it any less heavy or tripped-out. Instead, it makes the album feel more raw and visceral, which in turn makes it more powerful. The only negative for me is that the last song, the 10-plus minute \""Fuzz War,\"" really seems like it was just tacked on to make this a full-length LP as opposed to an EP. I was hoping for an epic mindblower, and instead all I got was distortion and feedback. All \""Fuzz\"" and no \""War.\"" Bands like Spacemen 3 and Sonic Youth had some droning feedback tracks, and they were interesting, even euphoric, but all I felt here was...well...boredom--something I thought I'd never feel when listening to a Ty Segall album. Although, considering the rest of the album made me feel worn-out and slightly insane, maybe a 10-minute comedown was necessary before taking the ride all over again.<br /><br />Despite the one relatively minor complaint, 'Slaughterhouse' is still nearly a half-hour of heavy, fuzzed-out intensity, and hopefully it's just the first of many from the Ty Segall Band. Ty already has a number of near-masterpieces in his catalog, and if this album is any indication, he just may be on the verge of creating a straight-up, no qualifiers, masterpiece.",2012-07-10,420,long,2012-07,music

It made me wonder if they just couldn't figure out the dynamics involved, but that makes little sense since every game prior to this one in the series had working AI (even if stupid) or so I am told.<br /><br />So 2 stars for now, if they add the much needed, much bemoaned feature that the entire community wants; I will return and give it its rightful, much deserved 5 star rating. Hope this clears up any confusion about the product, because at the moment, the game is NOT worth anything more then 10 bucks.",2012-04-16,241,long,2012-04,games
US,14042023,R2LW137KD43ABX,B004RSH9LY,191396594,Blind Sound,Digital_Music_Purchase,5,4,4,False,True,Amazing! ITN never ceases to amaze me. LOVE this album!,"Bought this without there being any reviews for it yet, and I'm glad I did. I've been holding off on placing a review for the album so I've given it about a week listening to it on a daily basis. From the moment the first track came on I was in a awe and that feeling hasn't changed one bit yet. In more ways than one, something about it reminds me of Duality, except on a more grand scale, but I can't really put my finger on it. None the less, this is a great album. A damn great one at that and I highly recommend it if you're a fan of ITN. I know, not the best review, but its something.<br /><br />EDIT: 4-13-2012 // Well, after listening to the album even more since my first review, I've changed my mind on a couple of things. First one being that when I stated that, \""something about it reminds me of Duality\"", it was more so the same feeling and impression that Duality left on me when I first heard it. I was literally in awe at the music. Apologies if anyone used my review based on that knowledge to buy this album. However, if you did purchase it, I'm more than confident that you weren't disappointed by it.<br /><br />If you're wondering what the album itself sounds like, here's a quick summary of it (would make it longer, but I'm at work). One thing that I noticed that when listening to it is that most of album has a very powerful, dark, and even sometimes an angry tone to it. Perfect examples of that would be track #'s 4 & 5 which are \""Crepuscule\"" & \""Trial By Error\"". I also noticed that the spoken word I've come to love on Duality, Anatomy of a Poet, and so on, are notably absent here. Obviously those are earlier albums and ITN's sound changes from time to time, but my point about that is that their spoken word vocals are usually amazing, and though I was a bit let down that this album didn't have any, the album itself still flows perfectly. There is decent amount of singing on the tracks though. Mostly it's the usual French female vocals which any ITN fan should beaccustomed to. The female vocals are consistent sounding throughout the album. There are a few tracks as well that have male borderline Goth sounding vocals included, which for some reason though, sound a bit different on each track they're on. The vocals on track #1 (Artisans of Civilization), sound more clear than when compared to track #2 (Past Glory), which sounds more distant and slightly muffled. The male vocals on track #7 (Lectern), falls somewhere between the former two examples. I don't think it detracts from the overall experience of the album, but it is a bit odd. Maybe the vocals were thrown in there at the last minute or maybe it's an intentional effect. But like I said, it doesn't detract from the album.<br /><br />Overall it's a really good solid release. My 5 star rating stays. It's an excellent album and I think even if you're the most critical, over analyzing critic this album shouldn't get less than 4 stars from you. I've been listening to this and other ITN albums at work for the longest time using the Amazon Cloud Player and I have yet to get tired of the music. Any of their music for that matter. Simply put, these guys are great at what they do.",2012-03-01,593,extra_long,2012-03,music

The use of Voice recognition software to give orers (Think Mass effect 3's version)<br /><br />What I got was a partially ported game, as in the game is best played with a game pad, as PC controls are so bad, they defaulted the menu with 360 controller Icons, its THAT bad.<br /><br />Controls:<br />The controls for keyboard and mouse are terrible, as in everything is done wrong, from switching the aim, inverting the mouse completely and having a key that doesn't appear to be on the keyboard to advance the menu and game, its basically unplayable and should not be used.<br /><br />The controls with the Xbox 360 are much better and very playable, everything is done correctly here, although thats no excuse, A Console port should allow for fully usable mouse controls, not a horrible afterthought.

The game makes it easy for players to find objectives with the push of a button. Its fun and its solid with the unique robot combat where selective parts that are blown off can affect the enemy performance. Have a crowd of enemies? Aim for the legs to slow them down. Need an extra member? blow the head off the robot to make them turn on their allies. Shoot an arm off and they will pick up their weapon with the other hand. There is not leveling for the main character, instead, players earn credits for each kill and can be spent for guns, upgrades and such. The communication system with voice chat is horrible, but the conversation system itself is pretty good, what you say to one may tick off the other player and lower their trust. The less trust, the more the NPC allies will ignore your commands. its an engaging system. There are some frustrating parts on normal difficulties, where its exceedingly hard and drops in difficulty later on and off.<br /><br />Story:<br />Pretty standard stiff so far, but enjoyable and carries the player forward.<br /><br />Overall: sad that the horrible keyboard and mouse controls hold the game back, because the game itself is very solid.

They fall for each other, even though it is forbidden, and go on an environmental adventure to save Lake Huron from oil drilling.<br /><br />The story mostly takes place on the beaches of Lake Huron where teen, Julia, now lives with her environmental parents helping to build wind turbines in the lake to create environmentally safe energy. Not far away from them is the oil-drilling company that wants to set up oil rigs in the lake. While exploring the beaches, Julia meets the attractive, black-haired Raymos, and they spend time together and quickly fall for each other. What Julia doesn't know at first is that Raymos isn't human, he's Lemoso.<br /><br />The Lemoso do not follow the traditional mythology of merpeople. Sophie Rhodes has created a completely new creature and mythos that humans have mistaken for traditional mermaids. Like sparkly vampires, this was disappointing for me. I wanted to read a book about traditional mermaids. These Lemoso were more like aliens living in the sea. Once I got used to the idea, the story was fine, just not what I was looking for.<br /><br />The novel has a strong environmental message, and I do mean strong. You are hit over the head with it in the second chapter. I'm not against novels having a positive message. I can even relate to the environmental concerns of the book. I grew up in Florida on the Gulf Coast, and we were in a group called Secure that was against off-shore drilling. Sadly, the worst fears of the group came true, oil spill. I think the environmental theme could have been handled in a more subtle manor so it didn't feel like you're being force-fed.<br /><br />The characters are playfully written and at times enjoyable to read about, but then there are times when the character's reactions don't come across as realistic. When Julia first finds out the truth, she seems to handle and except it too easily, and when Raymos decides to let her in on the truth, the decision feels too easily made, too quickly made, especially considering the consequences. There are many areas in the book that I felt this way about the character reactions.<br /><br />This book is definitely for a younger crowd. I think 12 to 14 year olds will love this book, and the parents will, too, because there is nothing explicit for them to read such teens doing drugs, alcohol, or having sex. The only issue parents might have is that Julia's parents let her drive a car alone with only a learners permit, technically breaking the law.<br /><br />The writing style wasn't bad. It flowed and was easy to follow. There are a few areas that could have been handled better such as the part where Raymos and his family, and the council are all touching and the feelings are being transmitted. This section was choppy and repetitive, but there are only a few areas like this. I did come across several errors, typos; mostly words with -ed added to them that shouldn't have -ed.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say young girls are going to like this story, but if you're older, like me, and like reading young adult, you may want to skip this one, it's too young.e truth, the decision feels too easily made, too quickly made, especially considering the consequences.

However, as a previous reviewer of Book I mentioned, this should NOT be billed as \""fantasy.\""  I bought the first book, and pretty quickly noticed the mash-up of right wing and libertarian thinking (sorta Ron Paul meets Michelle Bachman) mixed with a overtly Biblical plot, but was willing to overlook it because the story was well told.  Besides, it was free that day.<br /><br />Then I made the mistake of actually purchasing, with actual money, the second book (this one).  I figured I'd get more of the same, and I was curious to see how the story would progress.  I was wrong, and I regret spending the $2.99 or whatever it was.  The actual plot makes up about a fourth of the book.  The rest of the book is a combination of Hal Lindsey (anyone remember Late Great Planet Earth?) and a political lengthy exposition of, among other things, the horrors of (1)government-sponsored euthanasia, (2)public school teachers being brainwashed so that they can, in turn, brainwash our children, (3)nationalized health care, (4)the \""nanny state,\"" (5)moving away from the gold standard so that we can go to electronic transactions, which will, in turn, lead to the dreaded number of the beast, (6)women who don't conform to the traditional Biblical role laid out for them, (7)divorce and broken families,...I could go on...and on...and on... Certainly this author did.<br /><br />Like I said, his political and religious stance is neither here nor there, although it did bother me that women were, with few exceptions, portrayed as \""good wife,\"" \""virgin,\"" \""shrew,\"" or slut.\"" (He did not, of course, put it like that, but the female characters are almost all very much caricatures of those four types.  For example, one woman, an inn-keeper, single-handedly (and literally) drives away her husband and several of her children because she is such a mean-spirited person--although the husband, who flees the woman, is derided as \""Oath-breaker\""--primarily because he deserts his children and leaves them with the terrible woman--he is treated somewhat sympathetically (after all, who would want to stay with a shrew?) This view is backed up by a verse in Proverbs about the misery a nagging woman brings to the household.  Apparently she trapped him with her womanly wiles, and as soon as he married her, she transformed into the stereotypical shrew, victimizing the poor fool.  It's all very silly and cliche.  Another woman, who had been abused as a child, is put into power by the Big Bad Guy to serve his nefarious ends because she is politically and emotionally incompetent.  God forbid she deal with her issues and emerge stronger because of them.  When put into power, her hatred of all men promptly leads her to pass ridiculous laws like \""all men must urinate sitting down\"" in a bizarre attempt to humiliate them.  Of course, she becomes a laughingstock, and is later reduced by the Big Bad Guy into something like his love slave--although the process behind this transformation is never explained.  One minute she's an incompetent and angry ruler, and the next time you see her, she's dressed in slut attire and washing the Bad Guy's feet with her tears and drying them with her hair.  Weird.  Rachel, the main love interest, exists only as a virginal, Godly, one-dimensional, ridiculously sweet helpmeet to the Hero.  What truly bothered me is that the storyline is so thin as to be almost nonexistent, and it appears to exist only to bolster the political and religious opining of the author.<br /><br />I bought this book because I wanted a good story, and instead I got a badly veiled version of Revelation mixed with Fox News political commentary.  He didn't even bother changing the names towards the end, using terms like \""Gog and Magog,\"" \""Philistines,\"" and \""Chaldean.\""  Bible passages are quoted in their entirety, and the Temple cleansing ritual comes straight out of the Old Testament.  His description of Hell was unapologetically cribbed from Dante's circles of Hell in \""Dante's Inferno.\""<br /><br />This book should have been marketed as \""Christian Fantasy\"" or \""My Opinion of How Revelation Will Play Out\"" or \""What is Wrong With Our Politics Today and How it Will Lead to the Number of the Beast Being Tattooed on Every Hand or Forehead.\""  It was NOT a fantasy story, and I can forgive everything but the fact that I wanted to be entertained, and instead I was lectured on politics and religion.  Although I suppose it's a good thing the plot was so simple and thin, because otherwise I would have forgotten it amid the PAGES and PAGES of political and religious commentary.<br />He wants me to pay .99 for the next 43 pages or so in this installment.

Alex, the older and more protective sister, starts to act strange.

You meet AdriaÃ¢(tm)s new friends and you also meet the Mayfair family.  A unique family in their own right.  Zia is an immediate fave of mine and becomes a true friend to Adria.

So far, IÃ¢(tm)m in love with Isaac.  He is the epitome of what a  dream guy would be.  Only time will tell as the series continues if that will stay the same or not.    I have to admit there are characters that I really donÃ¢(tm)t like and I truly think thatÃ¢(tm)s the point obviously.  IÃ¢(tm)m not a fan of IsaacÃ¢(tm)s father, the head of the Mayfair clan.  Sure heÃ¢(tm)s the ideal  pack leader in many ways  but I was repulsed by most of his behavior.  And poor Aramei.  Her story alone, makes me say that this book would not be appropriate in my opinion for anyone under the age of 16, maybe even 18.  There are some parts that are defenitely not appropriate for the younger crowd.  These parts are repulsive but yet necessary to describe the characters and the way their system works.  I am defenitely a fan of this book.  I honestly can not wait till I can get my hands on the next book in the series!  In my opinion you will not be disappointed.  This Author delivers!

The story is about a teenage girl who gets lured in and taken advantage of by a sexual predator. And it shows the aftermath on what it does to the victim's family. And while the first half of the film was decent, the second half and end result of this film left me wanting a lot more. And quite frankly, pretty bored as well. Perhaps this is a more realistic look at what families deal with when coping with victims of sexual predators, but as a movie, it was left incomplete. I felt that there was so many different ways the movie could have went that would made it so much more interesting and entertaining as a film. But instead, it doesn't really go anywhere. There's no real action taken or no real conflict resolution. After the point in the film where the teenage daughter is raped, I think the viewer is expecting that to build up into a number of other plot points. One major gripe I have is that the movie teases you into thinking something is going to eventually happen. Is the father going to track down the guy himself and kill the offender or bring him to justice? Well it seems like that's where the film was going, but it never does. I kept waiting for something along those lines to happen..perhaps the FBI catches the guy? Maybe he comes back to try to kill the victim and the family? But no, none of these things ever develop. The film didn't even have enough guts to kill the victim off when she attempted suicide near the end of the film. Any of these events would have made the film a lot more interesting, and you would have at least seen some sort of satisfying ending. Instead, its scene after scene of the family members trying to deal with the event. I understand that those scenes are needed to further connect with the characters, but you need plot development in a film, not just character development. There's a few scenes where you feel that the father (Clive Owen), is going over the edge, but as I said, nothing develops from it. Again, I understand that this is probably depicts a more realistic view on a situation like this, but this is a movie, not a documentary. There is still an element of entertainment and interest that should be reached, no matter how serious the content may be for some viewers. I understand that there's probably a lot of parents out there that attach themselves to this film a bit more, simply because its more easier for them to relate to it, and that's great. But for me, I was expecting a better film than this. I'm not saying the film is bad, in a sense of acting or film-making. And the basic premise of the film is really good.

Triumph of Steel was the last really GOOD Manowar album, everything since has been somewhere between disappointing to fair at best, then after another ridiculous 6 yr wait here it is, and wow , I mean WOW! I was fully prepared for disappointment but not the outright slap in the face that this album is.<br />This is so bad it almost seems like a bad inside joke is being perpetrated on the fans, it seems like more of a spoof than anything put out by spoof bands such as Spinal Tap, Steel panther, or Tenacious D, I am being serious, any album by those bands seems almost \""Shakespearean\"" compared to this.<br />First, let's address the 800lb gorilla in the room- the HORRENDOUS production, this is not only the worst production on a Manowar album but may go down in the annals of metal history as one of the worst productions ever, even the few good tracks on here, such as the title track, are rendered almost unlistenable by the horrendous annnoying bass buzz that sounds like a blown speaker  and permeates every track on the album, why Joey seemed to think this would sound \""cool\"" is beyond me.Then Joey made a big hoopla over the return of drummer Donny Hamzik, yet most tracks sound like programmed drums, and if they aren't programmed then they went out of thier way to make real drums sound like programmed drums. Guitar solos-:lousy, misplaced, and without cohesion. Lyrics: for a band that has been routinely ridiculed for being cheesy over the years, it's almost as if they went out of their way to be \""extra cheesy\"" on this album, seriously, Wisconsin hasn't produced this much cheese in the last 6 yrs.<br />Even the musical compositions are tired , boring, cliche' and without a single ounce of creativity.<br />It would be too easy to say that because the band has been around for 30 yrs that they are creatively \""spent\"" , because Accept which has been around even longer has just put out back-to-back the two best albums of their career, and Overkill,Exodus and Riot have also been putting out some of the best material of their careers. Nope, this is just plain INEXCUSABLE folks. Anyone defending this album is like a religious zealot who refuses to believe what his own eyes and ears are telling him. This album is one of the biggest turd sandwiches that a band has ever served to it's fans.<br /><br />addendum: I just relistened to this several times and played it back to back with  \""Gods of War\"", and the much derided GoW seems like an outright masterpiece in comparison, at least they were trying to evolve on that album, it just needed less narration and more balls-out uptempo numbers, LoS on the other hand represents a devolvement and has only ONE truly uptempo track on the whole album,the rest are just plodding mid-tempo numbers and ineffective semi-ballads. If possible, Manowar need to go in and adjust the bass sound on the masters before the hard copy CDs get released, that is truly the most off-putting aspect of this album that renders even the tolerable songs unlistenable, .. even that would only bring this album up to \""tolerably mediocre\"" and 2.5 stars versus the outright atrocity it is in it's current form.",2012-06-25,600,extra_long,2012-06,music

Told from all of the characters' perspectives, the reader gains incredible insight into everyone's lives, their memories of Leo and the emotions they are experiencing.<br /><br />The World Without You is a well-written story with amazing character development. David and Marilyn are mired in grief over Leo's death. Their marriage is on the verge of collapse as they each grieve their loss in completely opposite ways. Oldest daughter, Clarissa and her husband Nathaniel are struggling with infertility. Lily and her long term significant other, Malcolm are comfortable in their non-traditional relationship. Noelle is the former wild child of the family who is now an Orthodox Jew living with her husband and four young sons in Israel. Thisbe, Leo's widow, is struggling to move on and she has her own secrets that she must reveal before flying back to California.<br /><br />Through flashbacks and stories, Leo is brought vibrantly to life by the various family members. Fun-loving and playful, Leo is the adored baby of the family. Deeply committed to his career as a journalist, he voluntarily accepts a reporting job in Iraq. The fact that Leo is a civilian casualty of war shines the spotlight on the non-military deaths that are oftentimes overlooked.<br /><br />The World Without You is a fascinating character study that seamlessly weaves together past and present. The characters are brilliantly realistic with realistic flaws, shortcomings and vulnerabilities. Joshua Henkin beautifully demonstrates the complexities of adult sibling relationships. Never maudlin or angsty, The World Without You is a gripping family drama that I highly recommend.<br /><br />Review copy received from publisher through NetGalley.",2012-06-20,297,long,2012-06,ebooks

His talents are showcased in this romantic comedy with lots of slapstick and his incredible sense of timing makes the funny moments sidesplitting! Virginia Cherrill was perfectly cast as the blind flower girl with whom Chaplin's `Little Tramp\"" character falls in love, even though at one point Chaplin seriously considered using Georgia Hale who worked with Chaplin in his film \""The Gold Rush.\"" The musical score enhances the film and the cinematography lacks nothing. In addition, the sets, costumes and choreography were all very well done--this movie is all THAT good.<br /><br />When the action starts, we quickly meet The Little Tramp (Chaplin) who has slept overnight on a statue being dedicated by the powerful people of the city. Look for some hilarious moments as Chaplin mocks the wealthy with their pomp and egotism! It also isn't long before The Little Tramp meets a beautiful blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill); he buys a violet from her--and, more importantly, falls in love with her. However, just by coincidence, right after The Little Tramp buys the violet from the flower girl a very wealthy man gets into his chauffeured car, slams the door and rides off. The young woman gets the impression that the man who just bought the flower from her is the very same man whose car door just slammed--and she can tell by the sound of the car door slamming that this was no ordinary car--it was a luxury car that only a very wealthy man could afford. Therefore, not only does the flower girl begin to sense the kindness of The Little Tramp, she also thinks erroneously that he is a wealthy man.<br /><br />The Little Tramp sets out to help the blind woman he loves; he finds out about an operation that can help her see and after he tells her about it he stops at nothing to raise the money for her operation--he even tries his best to get enough money to pay the rent just before the blind woman and her grandmother (Florence Lee) are evicted!<br /><br />It may seem as if I've told you too much but actually I left out some of the plot to keep it interesting and entertaining for you. Suffice it to say that The Little Tramp goes through a lot to try to raise that money. He tries his hand at amateur boxing, starts a curious relationship with a wealthy but rather melancholy alcoholic millionaire (Harry Myers) and more! There's also an especially powerful, sublime ending that couldn't have been done any better.<br /><br />The second DVD has wonderful bonus features. There's footage of Chaplin and Virginia Cherrill rehearsing the scene in which The Little Tramp buys the first flower from the blind flower girl. We also get footage of Winston Churchill visiting Chaplin and others on the set of \""City Lights\"" and there's a brief clip of Chaplin arriving triumphantly in Vienna in 1931--but Chaplin speaks only two words even after being cajoled by the cameraman!<br /><br />\""City Lights\"" has been recognized by the American Film Institute as the number 1 romantic comedy of all time; and the film ranks as number 76 on AFI's list of \""100 Years...100 Movies.\"" Clearly this is a must-have for any Chaplin fan; and people who like romantic comedies will not be disappointed.

It's also riddled with factual errors and egregiously bad logic. It's hopelessly naïve.<br /><br />Perhaps worst of all, it offers nothing in terms of new, inside information on the UFO issue. The rare tidbits it does offer are so stupid and laughable they're like something out of a Saturday Night Live skit. Here, I'll give you an example:<br /><br />The authors offer:<br /><br />A British \""scientist,\"" whom they do not name, says that his grandfather was a bodyguard for Winston Churchill during World War II. This bodyguard managed somehow to eavesdrop on Churchill having a top-level meeting with General Dwight Eisenhower. This bodyguard overhears their private conversation in which Churchill tells a story - whom he heard from someone else -- about a military pilot whose aircraft was buzzed for a few minutes by a UFO.<br /><br />This bodyguard then blabs it to his daughter -- who is then age 9 -- yes, he tells his 9-year-old details of a private meeting between the Prime Minister and the Supreme Military Commander of WWII Europe.<br /><br />Then - years later - eventually -- this daughter grows up, gets married and finally gives birth to \""the scientist\"" who one day hears the story from his mother - you know, the story she heard at age 9 from her loose-lipped eavesdropping bodyguard dad -- who overheard two leaders of the Free World discuss a second-hand report from an anonymous World War II pilot who saw a UFO.<br /><br />More years go by during which time the boy grows up, apparently goes through years of college - and at last becomes \""a scientist\"" - and voil&agrave;! -his story can finally be told! His information finally trickles into this book after the authors read it in  -- wait for it - wait for it - a British 'Red Top' tabloid, The Daily Mail!<br /><br />Yes!<br /><br />The Daily mail, a paper known for its sensationalism and fondly referred to by local Brits as \""The Daily FAIL\""!<br /><br />Woooo-hoooo!!!! Take that, skeptics!<br /><br />Speaking of newspapers and journalism, the authors' understanding of the media and the role of the press in society is abysmally simplistic.<br /><br />On the one hand:<br /><br />In typical conspiracy theory fashion, they maintain that a significant portion of those in positions of media power are on the payroll of the CIA, or some other nefarious government black-ops service.  Hand-in-hand with government spooks, and with pockets full of payola cash, these paid-off media operatives are expertly killing key stories, and also seeding well-placed disinformation stories to masterfully social engineer the perceptions of the public on the UFO issue. Yes! It's that easy!<br /><br />On the other hand:<br /><br />They repeatedly accuse the press of being \""lazy,\"" \""too timid,\"" \""hysterical,\"" \""asleep at the switch,\"" \""unwilling to challenge or confront powerful people\"" - in short, a gaggle of incompetent, pandering, lazy boobs who would rather stick to the easy stuff, you know, like the topics that shape people's daily lives, such as crime, the economy, covering local school boards and city council meetings, transportation, poverty, social injustice- the distracted lazy bums!<br /><br />Dolan and Zabel want it both ways - when they need the media to be a powerful, organized, efficiently competent manipulator of the minds of an entire nation, then the media is an entity of frightening power, efficiency and intelligence. But when they want to moan about the lack of media attention to the UFO issue, the media then becomes a \""lazy,\"" \""timid,\"" \""unwilling,\"" and \""asleep at the switch\"" -- a mass of bungling gomers who helplessly pander and suck up to powerful government agents.<br /><br />But notice when the authors need to provide a citation for one of their claims, they gladly pluck an item from a cheesy mainstream media British tabloid and serve it up to their readers.<br /><br />The authors also pass on a dubious bit of information which is often repeated but which has  been thoroughly debunked as -- if not untrue - at least improvable-  and this misinformation is that former CIA director William Colby director said, \""The CIA owns everyone of any significance in the major media.\""<br /><br />Again, Colby never said this, it has been all-but proven that he never said it, and those who care to Google this issue and check on it will see that I am right - and the authors should have Googled it and checked it too - but either they didn't, or didn't care to, but were happy to pass on this disinformation anyway.<br /><br />Okay, but now wait a minute - don't the authors cite an excellent Rolling Stones article by the mighty Carl Bernstein who showed in great detail how the CIA once recruited reporters and infiltrated all of the major news institutions, including the New York Times, Time Magazine and others? And don't the reporters themselves admit - even the owners and editors of these major news organizations admit - that they had dozens of reporters on the CIA payroll?<br /><br />Yes, but here are the facts: Those reporters were not involved in writing stories for consumption of the American public, or involved in shaping public opinions by seeding stories- stories that were dictated by CIA spies - and especially not stories about UFOs.<br /><br />Rather, the CIA was using real reporters as covers to act as spies mostly to snoop on other governments around the world, especially the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The CIA was saying to reporters things like, \""Hey, since you're going to Yugoslavia anyway to do a story about agriculture, will you check to see how many paved airports they have and how many Soviet aircraft you see while you're there, and let us know when you get back?\""<br /><br />Furthermore, when it became well-known that major media outlets were renting out reporters to act as part time information gatherers for the CIA, Congress objected to the practice and ordered that this kind of activity ended - which it did - some 35 years ago.<br /><br />If you don't believe this, and if you still think the CIA has an iron grip on the American Press, then ask yourself:<br /><br />* Why didn't the CIA stop the New York Times from publishing the Pentagon Papers, a devastating blow to the Vietnam War effort, and major embarrassment to the U.S.?<br /><br />* Why didn't the CIA stop the Washington Post and New York Times from knocking off President Nixon himself, the Vice President and other top power brokers over the Watergate break-in scandal? Nixon as Commander In Chief and top guy of everything had the CIA at his bidding.<br /><br />* Why didn't the CIA stop the Washington Star, New York Times from revealing the heinous Tuskegee Experiment scandal in which government creeps secretly infected black men with venereal disease so they could study them?<br /><br />* Why didn't the CIA stop Rolling Stone from running Bernstein's CIA/journalists Cold War connections article?<br /><br />* Why didn't the CIA stop the New York Times from breaking the Iran-Contra Affair, which was partly a CIA operation?<br /><br />* Why didn't the CIA stop the media when it uncovered and published the story of Nixon's Secret Bombing of Cambodia, My Lai Massacre, CIA involvement in Bay of Pigs Invasion, 9/11 government incompetence?<br /><br />* Why didn't the CIA stop Dana Priest of The Washington Post for her persistent, painstaking reports that uncovered the secret CIA \""black site\"" prisons in foreign countries and other controversial features of the government's counter-terrorism campaign?<br /><br />* Why didn't the CIA stop Barton Gellman of TheWashington Post for his authoritative and provocative coverage which blew the lid off the lie that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, embarrassing the CIA to a huge extent, and revealing the CIA as incompetent?<br /><br />Yea, verily, so it would seem that, despite what author Dolan and Zabel would have you believe, the CIA is not as all-powerful, and so in control of the press as they say.

While there is an Xbox 360 version out this is NOT a next-gen game mind you. The game does sport decent graphics but now in 2007 they feel pretty dated and there are a lot of collision detection issues and the game is very...green. While you spend 70% of the time playing as Jack you wish you could play as Kong more. There are a decent variety of enemies such as giant centipedes, bats, T-Rex, raptors, crabs and so forth you just wish there were more. When you play as Jack you in a first person perspective and there are no health bars, no ammo meters just you and your instincts. Ubisoft made it this way so the game feels more cinematic like the movie and it works.<br /><br />I was surprised how well you can aim with the spears and guns without a reticle and it's very easy to do. Playing as Kong, though, is the best part. You are in a 3rd person POV and the camera sweeps around dramatically while you beat up giant T-Rex and fend of dozens of bats. There are moments where you run along giant cliff sides and swing on huge pillars. While this is good and all it does get repetitive and it's the same thing over and over.<br /><br />The game isn't very well paced and there aren't any clips from the movie at all. This made things a bit disappointing but then again that's the whole \""feel like a movie\"" experience. While Ubisoft did a good job in the short time they had it could have been a lot better. The game also ends very abruptly and it feels like they took huge shortcuts. Despite all this you'll get a kick out of the game on any console and it'll sure to please the movie fans.",2012-03-29,355,long,2012-03,games

And my total entry time: AT LEAST 40 HOURS, and I was pretty well organized before I started.<br /><br />Of course the formats are different and I had no idea they would ask for information which I won't need unless I am audited.  Like the name and address of each of 20 charities I donated money or checks or credit card amounts or cash or goods or mileage.  I also did not know that when I was entering the cash or check amounts, I could have also entered the mileage and goods. Going back to do that was another mess. FRUSTRATION IN SPADES!

I do not do investing nor buying an selling.  I have no inventory.  I sell a service and so does my wife.  So the taxes should be farily simple, right? Not with Turbotax!  And no one to help me.<br /><br />After putting in all my information, spending approximately 25 hours and more doing so, I found that TT for some reason unknown to me, failed to keep all the hours of input I did for my wife's business. I figured it out because the amount at the top TT said I owed IRS was nearly 40% more than last year.  I looked to correct the problem by starting over to input my wife's business info.  In that process, TT erased the info for my business at each step without asking me the obvious question: Do you really want to erase this information?  Only when I finished entering my wife's info again did I find I had to enter all my business info again as well.  So now I have spent over 50 hours with TT.  I tried to contact a live person.  Could not do that.  I went to the website for Intuit and talked with a sales person about buying the $28/month accounting program they had earlier convinced me I needed.  The Intuit salesperson informed me that the TurboTax and the Quicken online accounting program ARE NOT COMPATIBLE. NNNuhhhh?  Intuit makes Quicken and Quick Books and TurboTax and you cannot import into anything with Quick in the title any information you have in TurboTax?  HOW STUPID? And the guy said, \""Yeah,we get a lot of complaints about that.\""  Really?<br /><br />When I got all finished doing what they told me to do? They made an estimate of my chances of being audited: 99% LOOK AT THAT!<br /><br />I will use a CPA THIS YEAR AND ALWAYS and never go back to TT or Quicken or Quickbooks or Intuit again.

While a lot of what they offered was very fun, there was a sense that developers were fragmented and really didn't know what an MMO should be.<br /><br />In 2004 Blizzard brought all the good things I loved about MMOs together into WOW. For example I no longer needed to worry about loot dropping on corpses when my character died or players looting my corpse. I no longer needed to worry about using reagents to cast spells. Finally a mapping system to tell me where I was in the world. The introduction of the Auction house system. The introduction of a banking system so I did not need to worry about players stealing loot I dropped to the ground because I could not transfer them to my mules fast enough. And a questing system that gave me a sense of focus by rewarding me with XP and loot, instead of aimlessly wondering around the environment grinding mobs for it.<br /><br />Over time I wanted MMOs to evolve to the next level. But I kept playing WOW because I felt the industry never seemed to grow passed their desire to copy WOW's model. So WOW remained the gold standard and the genre became stagnate.<br /><br />Then 8 years later ArenaNet releases Guild Wars 2. This game is EXACTLY what I've wanted MMOs to become. For example I never understood why any MMO developer would make PVP an integral part of their game then force me to grind through 70 levels of PVE content to actually enjoy it (GW2 doesn't do this to you). Or why an MMO forced me to visit an object in the world to get my mail, or an NPC to sell stuff on the auction house (mail and auction is only a menu option away). Or why the auction house couldn't be aglobal system across multiple servers to insure sufficient supplies (in GW2 the Auction House is regional, everyone in the United States shares one Auction House). Or why my Warrior couldn't equip and use a staff (GW2 lets classes equip weapons you wouldn't think they could). Or why it didn't matter how well I played, and that if someone had better gear they always seemed to do better (skill vs gear. GW2 is based entirely on skill). Or why the world NEVER changed, and ruins remained ruins and cities continued to thrive even when situated near enemy encampments (GW2 is a dynamic game. Outposts can be attacked, taken over, and then defended by the enemy).<br /><br />GW2 takes everything I love about MMOs -- all the foundations established by WOW, Ultima Online, EverQuest, Asheron's Call, Star Wars Galaxies, and so forth -- and greatly improves upon them. You probably paid $50 - $60 for games like Fallout 3, Oblivion and Skyrim and likely got a good 100+ hours out of them. What was that fun worth to you? Consider GW2 has no subscription fee and all of the content is available to you. If you only wanted to put 100 - 200 hours into GW2, is that worth $60?",2012-08-17,576,extra_long,2012-08,games

Utterly forgettable and tired.  Their conflict is also as tired as some of the scripted banter that tries to be much wittier than it actually is.

However, the sustaining ability of these types of albums is sometimes very limited as they quickly become all too familiar. The other type of albums are unassuming that slowly find a quiet place in your heart with its understated melodies with an enduring soundtrack that will last a lifetime. Two Views, much like the entire catalog of the gentle pianist Wayne Gratz, is one of those albums that is both endearing and enduring.<br /><br />Not since 2002's A Place Without Noise has Gratz collaborated with another musician. Since then his creations have featured the occasional wispy synthesized strings lightly washed in the background. This time around we don't even get that as Two Views is over 53 minutes of Gratz and his piano sharing his latest creations. Trying to find a favorite child is difficult but also trying to find a filler track just does not exist as all fifteen tracks have their own charming qualities.<br /><br />That said, there are some compositions that stand out a little more than the others and the first obvious one being the slow rhythmic melody of \""White Winter Dusk\"". One can almost imagine the twilight of a cold winter's day coming to an end yearning to embrace the warmth and security of home after a long harsh day. Similar effects are found on \""May Morning\"" only this time it brings to mind the slow silent awakening of Mother Earth on a soft day of spring. Even more leisurely is the spacious and almost improvisational qualities of \""Simply\"" that truly lives up to its title. Unfortunately, the song clocks in at just over three minutes leaving you with the feeling that the track could have been twice as long with no detrimental effect on its quality. The same can be said for \""Place Of Inspiration\"" and while the song is a little more structured, its spatial qualities are ever present.<br /><br />Two Views may not jump out at you but what Wayne Gratz album has? This gifted composer has found the ability to make intelligent and impressive music for over 22 years with or without a recording label. And while many other artists will come and go with their over the top musical presentation, Gratz track record, especially of recent, would suggest that ten years from now he will still be creating music that has the familiarity and friendliness of your well worn and favorite comfy chair.

Anyone without extensive background knowledge of the history of Angelus Temple, and the Foursquare movement, will have no idea how to find a cohesive point within this film. Even armed with the aforementioned history, I'm not sure what the interviews are intended to do.<br /><br />In between poignant, interesting commentary by Roberta Salter, and a few others who actually knew Aimee Semple McPherson, are clips of a contemporary woman \""faith-healer\"", named Gemma Somebody, who is remarkably self-centered, and hadn't even heard of McPherson until recently.  My guess is that the filmmakers were attempting to expose this bland, shallow, somewhat ridiculous \""ministry\"" that claims inheritance to Aimee's mission, and to hint that other current \""heirs\"" are equally unworthy.<br /><br />There are additional random clips, of gentlemen who were born \""into\"" McPherson's church, married by McPherson, etc.  These men seem to be lovely people, and their devotion to their denomination's founder is evident. At the unusually massive (by California standards) monument over McPherson's grave at Forest Lawn, one of these men laments the removal of statues of angels from the monument, stating this was because the angels were deemed \""inappropriate\"".  To whom they were \""inappropriate\"", or why they were considered so, is never explained.<br /><br />The contrast between the rantings of the dull, self-delusional Gemma Who-ever-she-is, and the magnetic, vibrant recordings of sermons by Aimee McPherson, is stunning.  This doesn't prove whether McPherson was \""guilty\"" or not of being a duplicitous liar, of course.<br /><br />The footage of Roberta Salter, McPherson's daughter, is absolutely horrible.  Her face is shown at an angle, either shadowed, or with light glaring off her glasses, so her eyes can't be seen.  The tinny piano accompaniment throughout the documentary is full of glaring mistakes, and the piano itself is terribly out of tune.  If this cacaphony is meant to cause viewers to sympathize with the architectural preservationists, it fails miserably.  Salter maintains McPherson's innocence in covering-up a month-long disappearance in 1926 with a concocted story of being kidnaped, (rather than admitting to indulging in activities that would be condemned by a court of ignorant public opinion). This is hardly surprising. What kind of person would turn on her own mother, 60+ years after her tragic death? And if Salter had revealed some unsavory information, would thousands of Foursquare churches suddenly cease to exist? Would all of McPherson's undeniable accomplishments through compassion and grace fail to have changed America's religious history?<br /><br />There is no footage shown of the interior of Angelus Temple.  The interviewees occasionally refer to revisions of the decor of the sanctuary at Angelus Temple, but the seemingly sordid details of the impending changes are never revealed. The spokesperson for the National Register of Historic Places is clearly upset by proposed changes, but he never elaborates on what it is he's trying to preserve. Instead, we hear vague statements about plans to \""lower\"" the dome, and to replace the proscenium and mural with \""huge video screens.\""<br /><br />The \""angels'\"" temple had been decorated predominantly, (and thematically), with bells and...angels. Above a dramatic proscenium, a 40 feet long mural painting depicted, \""Jesus Christ accompanied by the hosts of heaven with their long, slender trumpets. Jesus appears in the center with outstretched hands.\"" (from Aimee: The Life Story of Aimee Semple McPherson by Aimee Semple McPherson). I have never seen the original interior, but I've heard wistful tales. As a lover of architecture and history, I would have liked to see the sanctuary before it was remodeled. However, I understand that the mural, etc. which were produced with good intentions and lots of flair, may not appeal to current seekers.<br /><br />The sanctuary has indeed been \""modernized\"" and the ornate ostentation of the original theme has been replaced with the feared \""multi-media\"" objects.  The negativity toward this is presented entirely from points of view emphasizing either nostalgia, or a zealous desire to preserve historcial American architecture. The filmmakers juxtapose the issue of remodeling an unused, albeit historical, sanctuary with stories from the last known living family and friends defending the honor of Aimee Semple McPherson.  It's as though the sanctuary remodeling is a direct result of bad press in 1926, in spite of the fact that the temple, at the time of the interviews, was crumbling to the ground.<br /><br />Maybe I'm wrong, but if Aimee Semple McPherson was half of the person she seemed to be, I believe she'd been reeling in delight if she could see the church she built as it functions today.  It's not as fancy, or flashy, but,she herself claimed that the ostentation was there for a reason: to bring in people.  The mural was there for a reason:  to comfort people. The cathedrals and basilicas of history rarely function much beyond being tourist attractions. Had \""multi-media\"" been available to her, McPherson would, undoubtedly, have been designing websites, tweeting, blogging, and probably even programming media, with all the cleverness and zeal she put forth in all her illustrated sermons. I think she'd be filled with joy and delight if she could know the church she put her whole life into building, is, once again, a vibrant center of worship; that it's the church of the Dream Center. The revitalization of community in Echo Park (and all around the world), is due in part to the inexhaustible determination of Matthew Barnett, the current Senior Pastor at Angelus Temple. Lack of gilded seraphim embellishing the walls aside, Barnett has \""done Aimee proud\"" through incredible outreach and ministry during some of themost difficult times America has seen (i.e. Hurricane Katrina).  With over 7,000 members, Angelus Temple is, once again, home to a growing congregation of people who need compassion, love, and a reason to live.<br /><br />Depicting the refurbishing of Angelus Temple as some sort of sinister plot devised by rival evangelists is unfair. Insinuating that these \""rivals\"" somehow tried to keep this nonsensical documentary censored is a rather pathetic attempt at a sales tactic.  This documentary is not about \""saving\"" Sister Aimee. It's really about smearing the people attempting to keep Angelus Temple a vital part of people's lives, instead of preserving the building as a musuem; a curiosity.",2012-06-09,1044,extra_long,2012-06,videos

Beginning with 2000's Music, there has been a slow, steady decline in the quality of her music. Don't get me wrong, \""Music\"" has some great songs, \""Don't Tell Me\"" is probably one of my favorites from Madge, and even \""American Life\"" and \""Confessions...\"" had some decent moments.

Why would you, The so-called \""Queen of Pop\"" need to have featurettes of stars that the younger generation adores? It would be because you are no longer relevant....<br /><br />MDNA made my stomach turn from the moment I knew it was going to be released. Let's start with the fact that she has airbrushed the hell out of herself in the artwork (Google \""Madonna un-airbrushed to get an idea of what she's really looking like these days), and used a concept she ripped off from another artist for the cover (google \""Sergio Lagos, Solo\""). Hmmmmmmm thats really innovative, to plaigarize someone else's ideas, then turn around and diss Gaga for doing the same. I am no Gaga fan, but let's face it: A lot of Madge's career has been a rip off in the first place...<br /><br />The actual music contained is a waste of time. \""Give Me All Your Luvin'\"" is garbage. Again, if Madonna was relevant, there would be no need for guest rappers and cutesy-baby talk lyrics. \""Girls Gone Wild\"" is a joke. C'mon? You know its bad when you have to start ripping off stuff from your own back catalogue. It's basically a remix of \""Act of Contrition\"" from \""Like a Prayer\"" album with a bunch of other crappy lyrics tacked on. \""Gang Bang\"", \""Superstar\"", \""I'm Addicted\"" are all notable for their awfulness. It's all eurotrash dance mix garb, which Madonna has played out for going on six albums now. This music is tailor made for people with absolutely no mind of their own who will buy anything that their \""idol\"" throws at them,for the sake of commercial appeal.

But I was intrigued and I've come to like the Warhammer universe through past games.  The game is a satifying package and a great experience.  I will warn however that though worth it for single player alone, single player itself is a bit short.  I took longer than many people rushing through the game and I still only clocked 15 hours.<br /><br />I haven't tried multiplayer but it's been well received.  But like I said this game is worth it for the single player alone.  UPDATE:  Multiplayer is fun.  Added Multiplayer section below.<br /><br />Experience:<br /><br />This is the games strongest point.  The feeling this game gives you by playing as a Space Marine is one of extreme power.  You feel like a walking tank that just lays waste to the foes around you.  Many foes you decimate violently or fling around like toys.  That being said on normal I had to play well or be destroyed after about mid game.  How they managed to make me feel so powerful while still challenging me is beyond me completely.  Very well executed.<br /><br />Story:<br /><br />Without giving anything away the story itself is pretty good.  There are some unexpected twists and turns and it's very grim Warhammer type stuff.  You deal with situations that come up as the unstoppable force that you are.<br /><br />Characters:<br /><br />The characters of the game all have extremely distinct and well done personalities.  I won't say there is a ton of depth, but this isn't an RPG.  There isn't alot of room to give them tons of depth.  They perform their roles extremely well and make believable characters bringing the world and experience to life.<br /><br />Weapons:<br /><br />As one person mentioned I wish there was a touch more flexibility with weapons, but I understand why they only let you switch out 2 of your eventual 4 weapon slots.  They wanted to make sure you had the base ability to deal with situations while still making sure ammo wouldn't be completely trivial.  I had plenty of ammo even on normal, but then again I don't spray and pray as freely as alot of players out there.<br /><br />Still, the weapons themselves are well done and even weapons overlapping in purpose are distinct from each other in execution.  Having a good mix of not only ranged weapon choices but melee weapon choices made me a happy panda....of death.<br /><br />I've heard of some having issues using the power hammer because to balance your insane melee prowess they limit you to pistol and bolter, but after adjusting my playstyle I had no real issues.  I am a primarily ranged player and I found, pleasurably enough, that you actually reload your bolter faster while carrying the hammer.  But then again, I don't spray and pray like some folks.  I can see those folks running out of ammo due to their poor accuracy.<br /><br />Jet Pack:<br /><br />The jet pack deserves it's own special mention because it is, in a word, phenomenal :).<br /><br />Combat:<br /><br />The combat itself is EXTREMELY satisfying and makes you feel like an unstoppable space marine without making you invincible.  That being said in single player mode campaign can get a bit repetitive once you've beaten the game.  It'll be good for short single player romps after beating, but single player doesn't have tons of reply value.  It's an awesome experience more than it is awesome combat that always stays fresh.<br /><br />Those looking to continue racking up hours need to hit multiplayer to extend the longevity of the game.<br /><br />Multiplayer:<br /><br />Multiplayer is fun.  Definitely different than FPS multiplayers and there will be a learning phase.  I won't say it's perfectly balanced however.  Seeing as ammo rarely comes into play the High powered weapons seem a little strong.  Lascannon (high damage low ammo sniper) and Melta Gun (High damage low ammo shotgun equivalent, can one shot) for instance, Plasma Cannons get spammed fartoo much with too little downside.<br /><br />  Melee seems initially too strong but once you learn what you are doing you can deal with them just fine.  Possible exception of the power hammer.  It can be traited for a 1 hit kill and currently it feels a little too easy to drop in and do that to even groups of clustered people.  The weapon swing speed is slightly too fast imo for it to be well balanced.<br /><br />Still, flaws and all, multiplayer is a fun romp and the ability to take the kit of the person that killed you on the next spawn makes needing to earn alot of the traits and gear a fun trip instead of a painful handicap.  Not to mention that your starting equipment, once learned, is surprisingly effective.<br /><br />Complaints:<br /><br />My complaints are few.  I wish there was more single player stuff to do.  It's fun, very fun, and you feel awesome.  But then you're done and all you have is multi-player.  I also wish the game didn't have so much pay for DLC for multiplayer.  I really feel that charging extra for more multiplayer modes is kind of lame.  Especially since it divides the community.  Multiplayer also needs a bit better balanced to be truly stellar instead of a fun romp.  Instant gratification kiddies can achieve more effectiveness than they should be able to with heavy weapons and power hammers because the ammo drawbacks/equipment drawbacks/swing speed never really come into play in multiplayer.<br /><br />Finally the stupidest complaint of all that's just personal preference.  I personally HATED trading in my pistol bolter for a plasma pistol.  I understand it has infinite ammo, and alternate fire mode that's awesome, and hits harder, but I'd much prefer an equivalent pistol bolter.  I'd love to be able to choose to be all physical weapons or all plasma weapons as well.  That means gimme a plasma version of the bolter.<br /><br />Still that's just thematic preference.<br /><br />Overall a very good gmae and for the price, holy crap worth it for the experience.  Just expect to spend alot of time in multiplayer if you want to play this for more than a few weeks.too much with too little downside.<br /><br />  Melee seems initially too strong but once you learn what you are doing you can deal with them just fine.

As outstanding as that one was, her latest recording takes it to the next level. The album was produced at Synchrosonic Productions by Grammy winner Corin Nelsen. While Heidi's music may generally fall into the acoustic new age category, there are elements of classical, jazz, and folk, as well as some unexpected ones.<br /><br />Interestingly, the album begins with \""Farewell,\"" a bittersweet composition that Heidi refers to as \""a valediction to things passed.\"" The piece which begins as a plaintive piano solo, evolves to include one of those \""unexpected elements\"" alluded to earlier. In my mind I could imagine a scenario where jazz virtuoso Keith Jarrett is alone in his studio playing a solo piano ballad, when Carlos Santana slips in through the back door, plugs in, and begins to join in with his signature soaring lead guitar. However, in this case the Grammy-winning guitarist was David Cullen, and the pianist, of course, Heidi Breyer.<br /><br />The musical interaction continues on the second track, this time between Heidi's eloquent grand piano and three-time Grammy winner, cellist Eugene Friesen, who is well known as a member of The Paul Winter Consort. While Heidi's influences range from the classical masters such as Bach and Chopin to the earthy folk music of Janis Ian, she pays a heartfelt tribute to her favorite jazz pianist, Bill Evans, on a spacious solo composition called \""My Peace Piece. The album is mostly instrumental, yet Heidi's lovely vocals also grace the recording.<br /><br />While solo piano \""passages\"" are interspersed throughout the album, further creative collaborations ensue on an evocative and soulful composition entitled \""Moondancing,\"" which features former Pat Metheney Group percussionist Jeff Haynes, and Premik Russell-Tubbs on sax. On the title track, Heidi is joined by the always-tasteful English horn accompaniment of Jill Haley. Insight into the inspiration for the title \""Beyond The Turning\"" can be found in Heidi's reflection that \""the concept of the road is so important, precisely because you don't know what lies beyond the turning, and the only way to find out is to travel it.\""horn accompaniment of Jill Haley.

It was very cool to be able to read a Mafia tale set in locations I had been to and are familiar with.<br /><br />However, while the basic story is at its core good and interesting, the delivery leaves much to be desired. I found the author's writing to be clunky and sometimes awkward. At many points, it was like the author was following a \""how to\"" by the numbers, introduce character, tell what he is wearing, give his impressions of the scene, have him speak. I just think that this book could have benefited greatly from a couple more pass overs by an editor.<br /><br />Where the book really fails is the characters. First, they are very one-dimensional and really not that interesting. You know everything there is to know about the character after the second time you meet them. Second is the Robin Hood complex that a lot of Mafia authors insist on giving their character and, for me at least, there is no bigger turn off in a mob book. The people who make up the Mafia are NOT nice guys. They are not decent folk just trying to make a buck. Sure, there are a few here and there that break the mold, but this should be the very, very rare exception to the rule, not the template for every \""good\"" made man with only the \""bad\"" made men having any kind of flaw or negative personality trait. The best Mafia tales give you characters that are multi-layered and complex and give you the personal dilemma of whether or not to root for these criminals. This nuance is completely lacking in this book. There are paper thin \""good guys\"" that are noble, trustworthy, loyal, chaste...and then there are \""bad guys\"" and there is little in between.<br /><br />This could have been a good book had the author spent a little more time sharpening his prose and presentation and had he presented realistic and interesting characters.

I could be wrong, but it seems like since they could never imagine themselves acting in such a fashion as the character, that it is truly \""impossible\"" that any of this really happened. In my opinion, it's their own sad attempt to make themselves feel good about being weak. This is not a direct attack on any of the reviewers, but rather on the common message that all three previous reviews seemed to reflect: that these reviewers were so upset that this character \""had the audacity\"" to be \""John Wayne-like\"". Heaven forbid that. Sure, there was an over abundance of \""macho\"" throughout this episode, but that was just window dressing, a background, behind a riviting, powerful and inspiring story. Hey, did anybopdy actually pick-up on the inspirational, exhilirating  nature of this message? Or were they just too busy trying to nit-pick and knock-down any scene in which the character displayed inner strenghth and character? Judging from the three previous poor reviews - and NO positive reviews so far, I don't know what's happened to most Americans in the last 10 years. The trend seems to be that we all want to apoligize for, and indeed- by \""horified\"" at, even the slightest bit of masculinity. I've come to the conclusion that we have a majority in our nation that are truly over-educated and taught to go along to get along, rather than to stand up for what's right - no matter what happens. Most Americans are not taught, and therefore have no idea, about the ammount \""masculinity\"" and \""John Wayne-ish-ness\"" that it truly took to create and sustain what has now become America. As evidence from the other previous reviews shows, America no longer celebrates fighting for truth, and fighting for principles above all else; but instead, we have become a weak, arogant, misled society filled with educated idiots who delight in throwing sissy fits about anything that hints of being \""macho\"" .... and that leads me to believe that all of America's enimies (and believe me - MOST of the world are enimies of America), are salivating at how feeble as a nation we have become.

I don't have any desire to be a pleasure slave, but he makes it look so damned good!<br /><br />Club Mephisto will test your limits. It will bring you down; make you take a breath, and just when you think some flowers and roses are coming. BAM! There is a harsh punishment scene on the cusp of an orgasm that makes you scream at the book and beg for more all at once. This is the story of Molly, a very well educated woman that met a man in a BDSM, who later became her Master and husband. Molly, from what I can tell, lived a life of order and control. You would have to in order to gain a degree in college. She has taken to her role of pleasure slave easily it would seem. Longing to please her Master in any way that he deems fit.<br /><br />HOT! So, taboo and wicked. This was a book about Total Power Exchange. I think, lately, with the whole boom in BDSM fanatics, peopledon't honestly understand what Total Power Exchange is. It is not \""We go in the bedroom and you top me for an hour, and then we are good.\"" No, if you are unclear on what a TPE is, then read this book. It is harsh, it is intense, and it will tangle your insides and make no apologies for it. When Molly's husband lets her know he will be gone for a week on business, she is upset; only to find out that she will be, being cared for by club owner, Mephisto, an enigma to most of the club patrons. Molly even worked under him for a time, and still knows nothing about him. Just that no one owns Mephisto and Mephisto truly owns no one himself; the ultimate Master and trainer.<br /><br />Molly is a pampered pleasure slave, her husband loves her and rightly so he married her. Mephisto is about to show her that she has been taking her pampered life for granted, and shows her the true meaning of being a slave. The story ripped at my heart and I really sympathized with Molly. Her experiences have only been with Clayton, her husband. And Mephisto owns her body and her soul by the end. He isn't totally brutal, he has heart, and softness that comes out at times when he takes her places she hasn't been in awhile. I have a few personal issues, but when I pushed them aside I could totally enjoy the book. It is difficult for me to understand why a husband would allow his wife to be humped by other men (There is an orgy scene at the club when she is owned by Mephisto.) And one after another she is filled and drilled. It was a hard concept for me to truly understand, but it didn't deflect my enjoyment.<br /><br />By the end of the story I was totally in love with Mephisto and Molly, and wanted inside Mephisto's head so bad I wanted to scream! This is an intense, BDSM erotic novel that tests the very limits of the mind and soul. Would you go that far for ultimate pleasure?

The same words that have been carved into the bodies of the last two victims, both who resemble her closely. During the course of the investigation, a third victim is found along with a link to Nine's past - Jake Westerly. Nine had a crush on Jake in high school, but he never paid her much attention, until he and his then girlfriend, Loni, broke up. One night together was all they had, but Nine's hopes for more were crushed when Jake went back to Loni.<br /><br />Jake Westerly is back in town to check in with the family business, when he runs across Nine. It's not the reunion he had hoped for as he quickly learns that he's a person of interest in a murder case. Against her better judgment, Nine confides in him the personal twist in the case, and he not only becomes protective of her, he decides he's going to tag along and help her. He learns that the path to her heart is a rough one. One that may not lead to a future if they can't catch the killer closing in on her.<br /><br />This was my first book by author Nancy Bush. The blurb absolutely caught my attention, and I was expecting the story to perhaps focus more on Nine and Jake's relationship, and the mystery/thriller part would flow alongside. The impression I was left with was the opposite. Nine is absolutely focused on her job, and she comes across as a little stiff (unless she has her repeating daydreams about that one night with Jake). Next to the wealth of information about the case, there's yet more information to digest about the highly dysfunctional Rafferty family. To put it into perspective, I counted around 30 characters, and those are the ones that I can remember. The character that really stood out was the villain. Sadly, most of the sex that happens in this book are his scenes.<br /><br />I didn't find the chemistry between Nine and Jake believable. On their own, they were great characters, but together, not so much. Considering how much Jake had hurt her in her teenage years, she never once asked him whether or not the rumors that humiliated her were true. Jake didn't even take the first step and apologize. Perhaps he was too drunk back then to remember, but addressing the pink elephant in the room from either of them is something I expected to happen. Overall the story was good, but I was a little overwhelmed by too many characters and by the family drama playing off to the side.

The old silent version is the best I've ever seen of St. Joan, and the other '90s version with Leelee Sobieski did a much better job of showing St. Joan's human struggles as a young girl responding to the call of the divine, but used by and eventually abandoned by earthly powers.<br />Okay, here are my issues with this depiction of the saint's life:<br /><br />1) The rape scene she witnessed with her sister.  This appears nowhere in the stories of her life.  Yes, we have very little hard facts to go by, but this fabrication made it look like Joan was motivated by revenge for her sister's murder and rape, rather than a holy calling.  The rest of the film for the most part supports this view (Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of her \""Conscience,\"" for instance).<br />2) The scenes where, after her sister's funeral, Joan refuses to make the sign of the cross, and then removes a chalice of wine from the church's tabernacle, makes the motions of consecrating it, and then pours it down her throat after shouting \""I want to be with you NOW!\""  There are two ways you could understand this behavior:  From a secular perspective, she totally lost grasp of reality after her sister's death.  From a faith perspective, this is complete heresy, not to mention silly misrepresentation of Catholic communion.  There would never have been a chalice of precious blood in the tabernacle (only the Eucharist, the hosts that have been consecrated at mass).  If someone ever performed any behavior like this, they would never be canonized as a saint in the Catholic Church.  Period.<br />3) The trippy scenes of her visions, where she encounters a slightly creepy Christ figure, and not St. Catherine, St. Margaret, and St. Michael the Archangel.  I don't even know where to start with Dustin Hoffman's character.  When I first saw him, I thought he was depicting Satan tormenting her in prison (his behavior certainly seemed more in-line with this analysis, although the credits list him as her \""Conscience\"").  Then at the end, he hears her confession and then absolves her of her sin!  We know St. Joan was confessed (by an actual human priest) and received the Eucharist, because we have the priest's testimony.  Another inaccuracy:  They show her finding her sword in a field, and her \""Conscience\"" has her consider all the possible ways that what she interpreted as a sign from God could actually have been just random chance.  While it is good to be cautious with interpreting signs, and should be discerned under the guidance of a trusted spiritual director, it is one of the basic elements of her biography that she found her sword in a chapel (I believe it was under a statue of St. Catherine).<br />5)Her death scene, where she is screaming as she burns at the stake, while some random person in the crowd waves a cross about, is very disturbing.  Yes the reality of someone being burned to death at the stake is pretty unnerving, but there seems to be something almost mocking about the cross, and her behavior looks more like despair than holy resignation (I know, I could never muster holy resignation while being burned... which is why I'm not a saint).  In her biography, St. Joan asked that someone lift up the cross that she might see it as she died, and her last word as she burned was \""Jesus.\""<br /><br />There were a few good moments in this movie.  I like that they show her repeatedly insisting that the army sends messages asking for the surrender of the English.  I like the scene where she rides across the field of battle to do this, prays for an end to bloodshed, and then the English turn away without fighting.  I like how they depicted her discovering the Dauphin in disguise.  But for the most part they made her seem like a raving lunatic.  It was a patronizing film told like the perspective of someone who does not believe in miracles, taking what I will admit is one ofthe more bizarre and mystifying saints' lives, and looking down on the ignorant peasant girl with a bit of spirit who got a little too much religion which made her an easy pawn for the political powers of her day.  Read the transcripts from her trial and you see a clever and faith-filled woman who is clearly grounded in reality.  This film is a gross oversimplification to the point of obfuscation of the real story of an incredible saint.",2012-05-09,780,extra_long,2012-05,videos

At least, that what it starts out to be.  Unfortunately, it devolves into \""crime thriller\"" with a sort of supernatural twist.<br /><br />There's nothing new here for anyone who's seen more than a handful of movies with paranormal twists and murder mysteries. You'll be able to figure out the murderer within the first 15 minutes of the film.  I don't always mind if I can predict the entire plot from the get go, so long as the journey to the end is exciting.  This one isn't.  It's a VERY paint-by-numbers mystery/thriller.  All the standard and predictable devices are there.  A murder - Check!  A person in a secluded location, cut off from all possible help - Check!  Weird villagers with uncertain motives - Check!  Crazy psychic lady appearing at random times telling you you're in danger - Check!  Finding names and dates of people on tombstones in old graveyards you thought were alive but are actually dead - Check!  It goes on and on.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Even as a \""just add water\"" mystery there are a few things that just didn't make sense or were completely unnecessary.<br /><br />1.  Thomas' death:  I was under the impression that the dead son would be MUCH for integral to the story.  That's what's implied.  Yes, I know his death is the entire reason Rachel goes to the remote cabin...to heal and write.  After his death, he serves absolutely NO purpose in the story.  In fact, you could remove every single scene with him after the opening 10 minutes and it would NOT affect the trajectory of the story whatsoever.  You could even remove him from the whole film and give Rachel another reason to go to the cabin, even for inspiration...and the film would unfold exactly the same way.  I felt like the dead son reappearing as a ghost bit was just thrown in for \""spooky\"" effect.  It only made the story drag, which could have been 20 minutes shorter without all the kid's scenes.  I know the writer intended these ghostly appearances to indicate he was trying to protect his mother from the killers, but it just didn't read that way.  She got away from the killers just fine all on her own.  The kid bit was gratuitous and unnecessary.<br /><br />2.  Husband as the killer:  It was obvious from the FIRST scene with Rachel that her estranged husband was going to kill her, but the REASON was very, very formulaic.  Insurance money?!  Really?!  I saw he was the killer (in cahoots with her best friend, Sharon) immediately but I thought the motive would be something more original.  I thought he was going to kill her so that HE could claim her new manuscript for himself, publish it under his own name and no longer be a failed writer.  THAT would have been more interesting, but insurance money?!  Ugh.<br /><br />3.  Strange Villagers:  WHY do the villagers speak  a nonsensical foreign language when in private or when Rachel isn't around?  This is VERY strange and never explained.  I thought they might be demons, speaking some weird form of supernatural language...but no.  They're very real people who speak some form of Tolkein-ish elvish language for NO apparent reason.  WEIRD. Just one more nonsensical bit added for \""spooky\"" effect but no logical reason.<br /><br />4.  Angus' Furniture:  So, Robert and Sharon were teaming up with a common thug to pretend he was Angus McCullough.  HOW on earth did they furnish the entire lighthouse with bed, table, chairs, wall hangings and tons of other furniture and then \""just remove it\"" to give the appearance Rachel was hallucinating?  Did they put a Uhaul truck on a ferry boat and take it out to the lighthouse island?  How could Rachel have not seen the items being removed, as she lives DIRECTLY across from the island.  That amount of stuff couldn't be removed quickly or clandestinely.  This was just a convenient plot device used to \""keep the story moving\"" but insulted the viewer's logic.<br /><br />Unless you've never seen a mystery/thriller before or anything like The 6th Sense, skip this one.  It's definitely a C- movie.",2012-09-29,697,extra_long,2012-09,videos

Then when I bought an iPod, I played them on there. I always loved them. A few days before I purchased this game I had just joined Steam, and I saw this on the store. I saw the trailer on it and It looked interesting. I decided to look up reviews and game-play videos, and I could not believe it. It was a Tower Defense title + MMO. It had all the great aspects of MMO's such as, Character classes and progression (Hero), Items & weapons for your Hero, Currency to buy items with, loot, and even a pet. But they still kept the \""Tower Defense\"" aspect of it in there, doing missions and challenges, all which consist of tactics -setting up defenses and preventing the enemy waves from reaching and destroying your team's crystal. This was so shocking, I had to try it out. I played the demo and I could not play it online, so it was pure solo. I have got to say while it may be slightly entertaining, it is not meant to be played only solo. It just lacks the social component which makes it an MMO. But on the other hand, co-op is GREAT. I convinced a buddy to get the game, (he's not a huge PC gamer) and now he's hooked on this. The ability to join people's game and meet them and learn strategies, or even hosting your own game and inviting your buddies to tackle the missions is very, very fun.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a great co-op game to play, MMO and Tower Defense freaks alike.<br /><br />It's very worth it, $2.99 instead of $15.99 through steam.

It seems like most people are saying they had low expectations, so maybe mine were too high.<br /><br />First, the production isn't very good - there's not much spacing in the mix of instruments, and it sounds kind of muddy in general.  It's certainly louder than the production of their older albums, but it's just not very clean when compared to most contemporary hard rock. When originally hearing the previews on YouTube, I just assumed the quality was somewhat bad because they were released before finishing mastering, or that maybe they intentionally reduced the quality for Internet pre-release. But that was actually as good as it gets. Very disappointing to listen to on headphones, in my opinion.<br /><br />Also, these are not vintage Roth performances. I realize that part of Roth's appeal is his creative abandon, but this often just sounds lifeless and more randomly disconnected than usual. Sometimes it just sounds like he's blurting random phrases from a notebook, like vocal guide tracks that never got finished. Not everywhere, but a lot. I know he's better than that.

Now I feel pretty disappointed and wonder how it got so many stars. It's not all bad so I'll start first with the good:<br /><br />The idea is very interesting, as is the universe in which it's set. I realized after reading a bit that the Victoria in the beginning was the same Victoria from \""A witch to kill,\"" which I had already read. The portrayal of the tension between witches and vampires was interesting to me.<br /><br />A lot of things happen, and it was fairly easy to read, although equally easy to put down.<br /><br />The central tension of the book was the suffering brought on Jack by his curse, and his desperate hope for it to be remedied. This is what kept me reading. Everything else that happens in the story seems like him just killing time. He at least seems to think he is until he implausibly falls in love with a lady and a runaway, which changes him after two hundred years of narcissism and psychopathy.<br /><br />The dialogue became witty at the end, and I felt I could finally get a glimpse of Jack's personality.<br /><br />The bad:<br />The premise of the book is that Jack suffers because he wishes he could sleep (not die so much as sleep, although he's prepared to die) and he can't. It's unclear why he wishes this. When I feel awake, I don't actually feel annoyed that I can't sleep or don't feel tired. People only feel annoyed that they can't sleep when they feel the painful affects of tiredness which cannot be abated because they can't seem to sleep. Jack does not seem to feel anything bad at all ever. I fail to see how this is a negative thing. Nevertheless I was prepared to overlook this and just accept the fact that he was given immortality when he didn't want or ask for it and now he's pissed off.<br /><br />Overall, the book lacks depth. Having an immortal protagonist who is struggling with immortality means addressing pretty profound themes--the consequences of living forever, not feeling pain, and not being able to sleep, what it means to be human, the purpose of life, the responsibility of those with power, the ability of relationships and love to change people when you live forever, the cumulative affects of life experiences, the power of choice and the suffering caused by loneliness. The depth of the characters do not reflect the weightiness of these ideas. I know it can be done without making the writing depressing too. Anne Rice, Jim Butcher and Kevin Hearne are some great examples of author's who have realistic seeming immortal characters, but are still very entertaining to read.<br /><br />The writing is weak and feels very superficial. It is full of distracting exposition and choppy sentences that don't reveal character. I don't have a strong sense of what makes Jack tick, the specifics of why he suffers, of his personality (until the witty banter with erica comes in), of why he makes the decisions that he makes--since he routinely states that he doesn't give a damn, although why he doesn't give a damn is equally unclear. Why does he just hate children? Why does he hate hugs? More insight into the degree of his suffering rather than just stating that he suffers would have made the book more interesting.<br /><br />*****Spoilers alert*****<br /><br />The ending action scene was a ripoff of the Resident Evil idea of a virus turning everyone into zombies and it was just ridiculous. What point did it serve exactly? It was just plain boring.<br /><br />The book is full of unbelievables. It's hard to swallow that he didn't let anyone get close to him in over two hundred years, is an absolute jerk to everyone around him (that we get to meet at least), and yet maintains hundreds of contacts apparently all over the world that he can just dial up at any time to commit heinous acts for him. Granted, perhaps you can hire enough bad guys if you have enough money, but to be a successful businessmen, don't you need to make friends in high places? He is clearly incapable of actually making any friends and he holds himself above humanity, yet somehow moves through it with ease.<br /><br />He's such a cutthroat that it's hard to see him falling in love with anyone if he's been like that for 200 years. Now, if he were self absorbed and feeling sorry for himself the whole time, rather than having turned into a psycho, then it would be believable that someone pulled him out of his despair. Sadly, that's not what we see.<br /><br />In the final third of the book, he's turned \""soft,\"" but is still able to go out and brutally murder people he decides deserve it, including women and children related to said person. Meanwhile Tiffany and Erica remain at home oblivious. That does not make him a more likable character. It makes him a killer with no conscience who somehow still has a family.<br /><br />I can't believe that Victoria waited until the end to tell him about her witch friend. They didn't talk for 100 years because she killed his last opportunity!!! The writer made it seem like everything Jack was doing up until the point he met Tiffany and Erica was just killing time until he found another witch. It is just unbelievable that she wouldn't run to him with the knowledge that a witch fixed the worst part of her curse as soon as it happened. I kept reading just to see when she was going to tell him and what her excuse for not telling him earlier was. It wasn't satisfying. I expected he would meet Kevin, and Kevin would fix it so that Jack didn't die, but he could at least go to sleep. It's a cliffhanger ending needless to say. I don't know what decision he'll make, but I will not be reading the next book.",2012-09-14,1027,extra_long,2012-09,ebooks

Do you go along with the nostalgia theme and cram it full of popular '90s hits, or do you try to replicate the formula of the previous soundtracks by keeping it current? Obviously they went with both, but the problem is it's a weird mix. Also, the climate has changed so much in the past 10 years that soundtrack albums aren't as popular as they once were, and they're certainly no longer platforms for launching hit singles (like Tonic's \""You Wanted More\"" from the first movie). So here we've got a soundtrack mostly loaded with songs that are/were already hits, but it's all pretty bizarre; the '90s hits by Spice Girls, Boyz II Men and Montell Jordan are actually from the mid-'90s, so they weren't even current when the first Pie came out in '99 (one reviewer remarked that the '90s songs somehow don't seem to fit - that's probably why). As for the newer pop songs on the album, most of it is stuff that the main characters in the movie wouldn't even listen to (in fact, a lot of it is used in the scene where they accidentally crash a high school party). What they could have done instead is feature some of the newer songs from bands like blink 182, Tonic, Offspring, Third Eye Blind and New Found Glory (they already have a recent song by Good Charlotte) - all bands that were heavily featured in the original movies, yet are still coming out with new music today.

For the most part, I'm going to point out limitations so you can be aware because I could not find this information on the company's site before I bought the software. Hopefully, this will help you know what you're getting and what you're not getting from this purchase.<br /><br />I haven't had time, but perhaps someone could compare this to the free ZygoteBody (the old Google Body, currently at zygotebody.com). They seem very similar although Visible Body breaks the anatomy down by system.<br /><br />It seems to include the major anatomy divided into the 10 major systems. It has a bunch of pre-defined views of the anatomy and allows you to zoom in and out. The viewer interface is similar to Google Earth. One major drawback is that there is no orientation indicator. For example, when I went to a view of the skeletal hand, I initially couldn't tell whether I was looking at the palmar surface of the right or the dorsal surface of the left. Of course, I figured it out based on the anatomy, but you get the idea that there is no overall indicator of your orientation relative to the major anatomical planes of the body. This is especially important since the default left mouse button behavior is to rotate the model rather than pan.<br /><br />A major limitation of the software, as far as I'm concerned is the lack of information on the connective tissue holding everything together. For example, in the spleen there is no indication of the attachment of the peritoneum, the splenorenal ligament, or the gastrosplenic ligament. The liver does have the major ligaments named, but the attachments are not shown. If you are interested in the attachments between the organs or the mechanical interactions of the organs, this is not the software for you.<br /><br />Also, in case you weren't aware, this is a static, 3-D \""picture\"" of the body. Imagine the old \""[[ASIN:B004ZETWLK The Visible Man Model Kit]]\"" that you might have had as a kid. This software is like having that model (with the plastic organs and all) with a computer to describe to you what it is you're pointing at. You can't move the joints, you can't jiggle the organs, you can't clip off an artery, etc.<br /><br />Finally, unlike Google Earth, you can't add annotations to the model.<br /><br />Regarding the software itself, every time I run the software, it pegs one of my quad processors at 100% (effectively using 25% of my available computing power). This is independent of whether it's in the foreground or even whether I'm interacting with it or not. There is no disc or network activity. I can only assume that this is a result of poor programming and effectively slows my whole system down. Not very neighborly when I'm trying to actually get work done on the computer while I review anatomy. In a nutshell, it has unacceptable processor requirements. I really hope that they fix this in the very near future.",2012-03-28,512,extra_long,2012-03,software

I honestly found many of the reviews to be more illustrative of the types of people the reviewers are than the type of person Zach Fortier is.  One reviewer described the book as more akin to spending an evening next to Zach on a barstool and listening to him tell his war stories rather than reading a novel.  Although that review wasn't particularly negative, the writer missed the point altogether in that this was the point all along.<br /><br />Zach Fortier lays bare the realities in police work.  The reason the book doesn't read like a novel is because police work is not like a novel.  We who serve don't get to bear witness to the beginning and the middle and the end.  One of the three, maybe, but certainly not all three.  Plot twists and character development, apart from coworkers, is not something we are allowed to experience.  A call is but a moment in time, and as soon as the bad guy is stuffed into a jail cell or someone is hauled off to the morgue, we don't have the luxury of getting to ruminate about the minutiae of every detail of the call, much less the person's life up to that point.  Once the ink is dry it's on to the next clusterf***.  That said, I think Zach Fortier did a fantastic job painting just enough of a picture of the characters he dealt with on each of these calls.  Honestly, if you want character and plot development, then look to fiction.  This is the real world.  So have a go and see if you can make it without flinching, because the types of things written about in this book are occurring right now, as you read this, in dozens, if not hundreds of cities and towns across the country, to say nothing of the world.<br /><br />To those who find Fortier himself a disturbing character, get over yourselves.  Nobody, not even you, made it this far without character flaws and pecadillos.  Your life has been shaped by what you've done, seen and experienced, just as Fortier's has.  And I'd imagine that if you laid your life bare with the candor that Fortier did, it might disturb some of those who thought they knew you best.  Fortier has exquisitely and accurately depicted some of the anguish and trauma that police officers are routinely subjected to in their careers, and he did it by painting a tapestry that included why he is the way he is.  Personally, I found the blatant honesty downright refreshing.<br /><br />So if you want to learn what the real world is like...the one that happens after you shut out the lights of your 3 bd, 2 1/2 ba house with the white picket fence, then open your mind and read this book.  Although you may not find it uplifting or enriching, it will most certainly be entertaining and eye-opening.  However, if you'd rather keep the wool over your eyes and the cotton in your ears, then by all means, stick to your books about rainbows and unicorns or smooth-chested, French kissing Fabios and find your fulfillment there.<br /><br />Me?  I'm sticking to what's real.  And Fortier nailed it.<br /><br />Casey Gleason",2012-08-13,560,extra_long,2012-08,ebooks

For many this might make him the best performer out of the three and therefore the best doctor; however, he lacks vulnerability in his approach.

And to his credit Smith portrays this very well actually, but it's not as interesting because it was the doctor's vulnerability that made him so easy to relate to even though he is an alien time lord from outer space that travels in a 1960's police box. There are so many scenes where Smith chooses not to show any fear in the face of danger, while Tennant and Eccleston often did. If the doctor isn't scared about what's about to happen then why should the audience care what's going to happen? I found myself drifting in my attention sometimes. The main problem is that the writing in seasons 5 & 6 is significantly less interesting than it was during Tennant's reign as the doctor, which means Matt Smith has less rich material to work with. (Not always- \""Vincent & the Doctor\"" in season 5 and \""The God Complex\"" in season 6 for instance are well written episodes).<br /><br />All in all I don't find seasons 5 & 6 to be nearly as good as previous seasons, but most of that has to do with the writing rather than the new doctor. Upon investigation I found out that indeed the writers did change at the start of series 5. That explains a lot. But don't get me wrong- it's still Dr. Who so it's still fun to watch, but I find that previous seasons were much more memorable.",2012-07-31,435,long,2012-07,videos

It is hard but not as hard as a lot of negative reviewers are saying. I think they are disrespecting the game based on frustration, as this game isn't really 'harder' than other modern games, it just plays like an old-school game in the ways that it is difficult. It doesn't tell you exactly what to do, but it does give you explicit hints if you talk to the npcs. This is a 'build' game. You need to plan out what type of character you are going to use and level your stats accordingly. Capitalize on weapon bonus parameters where appropriate, but if there are no parameters(e.g. elemental weapons) do not waste points on excessive skill level-ups. You can play this game to create the most powerful character at the end-game, or plan for a longer, multiple new game plus character (you can restart the game with respec'd enemies and all of your previous gear up to 8 times). Some things are really best achievable through multiple play-throughs.<br /><br />The graphics by default are pretty good, I play it on a laptop with an i7 and a decent (but not true-gamer level) graphics card and it runs buttery smooth, with a lot less slowdown than the console versions (in areas like blighttown). There is an easy mod to really unlock the game to true pc standards if you want, but the game does not run poorly by any means (despite what a lot of people say. i beat it in one sitting with no tech issues at all). Whatever you do, play with a 360 controller (or some cont that can mimic one). This game is unplayable on kb/mouse.<br /><br />The atmosphere of dark souls is really freaking cool. There is an amazing back story to theworld if you talk to the npcs, observe the objects/environment and the enemies, and read the in-game descriptions of everything. There are two endings which are both open to interpretation. Overall I really, really love the mysterious fantasy world of this game.<br /><br />You can play the game with a wide variety of strategies/character builds. There are covenants, or groups of players with specific goals in specific areas of the world, and they are all fun to get into and rank up for some epic gear. I have beat this game 20+ times over the three of its platforms (ps3, 360, pc). The multiplayer is really fun, too. Don't expect to join up with your friends for some hack/slash though, the game doesn't work like that. Basically you can jump into other players worlds to either co-op kill bosses, or to kill them. People will periodically (if you're in human form, not hollow form) jump into your world to try to kill you. It's great fun, really, I have had some epic battles against other players. There are sort of designated PvP areas if you are into that. It is very hardcore though, and you need to be spec'd appropriately for these fights or you will be curb stomped repeatedly by pros. Personally I am more of a co-op guy (some of the pvp players are just exploitative and cheap), but i will mess up invaders in my world because when I go human i am never alone (i've always got 1, and most of the time 2 co-op guys).<br /><br />Bottom line: B U Y  T H I S  G A M E! and of course, Praise the Sun!",2012-12-30,622,extra_long,2012-12,games

Some of their best work is in the phony product advertisement genre and I eagerly paid the $9.99 to see this movie, expecting to break my remaining ribs. I did not.<br /><br />The plot was not the most clever, but it did hold up. The gags were not the most original, but there were many surprises. There were a couple laugh-out-loud moments, even a scream-out-loud moment when I had to watch a supposed real penis get pierced with a fish hook. But overall, it was not the transcendental seminal movie experience I had been hoping for, one in which the TV viewer is elevated to film premier attendee and one in which the actors and their material is brought to a higher level of entertainment. The cable access style film editing of the show seems to work better when the themes are short and to the point...not drawn out of 90 minutes of 35mm film like quality.<br /><br />These guys are still funny and they show a lot of talent, but this movie fell flat.

Wondering if it was the same crappy recording I already had, or if it was a better version of it, I decided to try my luck at purchasing it to see. My curiosity is now satisfied at the tune of 99 cents... It is the EXACT same recording. Guess that answers my question, lol. :p<br /><br />Just so you know what my review was for this file from the other link here on Amazon, I will repost it below to benefit others interested in this file:<br /><br />*~ I have recently purchased a few of these binaural beat brainwave subliminal system mp3 files to place on my iPod to play on our bedside clock/iPod player before and during sleep, and have found this one the worst quality one among the ones purchased. Like another reviewer noted, you can hear the voice underneath the sounds and music, which you don't hear in the other files I purchased. The higher the volume, the more clearly you can hear the messages repeated by the voice. Also the sound of the music sounds a bit off and a little fuzzy, not good quality. It's as if this one wasn't as well produced or recorded as the others.<br /><br />The music isn't soothing either. The pinging of the piano is very sharp and intrusive, and some of the sounds are a little unsettling, like creaking noises that sound more like a creaky door or footsteps on a creaky floor. To me, they make better sound effects for a haunted house than a relaxation and subliminal type of recording.<br /><br />Each one in this particular series has a short message/warning at the beginning about not listening to these while driving or operating machinery, and at the end about the session ending and giving yourself a few minutes to bring yourself out of it and make yourself alert before continuing your daily activities if you are using this for meditation, I suppose. A little annoying, but not a deal breaker for me. However, on this particular one, even the warning sounds slightly fuzzy, with a slight weird echo to it, and as messed up as the rest of this file.<br /><br />If you still want to try it out for yourself, at 99 cents, it isn't too much of a loss. However, it is not as good as the others I purchased from this series, and I am not impressed.~*<br /><br />Lillia~ (Bob's Wife)",2012-12-31,434,long,2012-12,music

But if you're new to JT & the Sinners, I wouldn't start with Bad Juju.  I'd recommend Whiskey Sessions and Dark Days (when he was still the Jackson Taylor Band) or Aces and Eights.  This album shows a stripped down JT/S reworking the arrangements of many of their previous hits and fan favorites to varied degrees of success, combined with covers of Johnny Cash and Elvis.<br /><br />Here are my opinions on each of the songs on the album:<br /><br />1. I Got Stripes- A cover of the classic Johnny Cash song with lyrical twists only Jackson Taylor could pull off.  One of my favorite songs on the album.<br /><br />2. Humbolt County Grown-  The best song on the album and by far the best result of JT changing up the arrangement of the original song.  I was never a big fan of the original version but I love this song.  (Original version on the album Humbolt County)<br /><br />3. Goin Down Swingin- Until the chorus this song hangs with the original, but once the chorus starts it loses me.  This version is more straight ahead and repetitive, losing the melodic elements of the original.  (Orig version on Goin Down Swinging)<br /><br />4. That's Alright, Mama- An Elvis cover that I'm not familiar with enough to compare, just like the title this song's alright.<br /><br />5. It's Not Supposed to Be That Way- You would think the stripped down arrangement of this song would fit very well because it is a very honest, heart wrenching song, but Jackson's original version is much better.  I think this version would be great to see performed live where the intimacy of the song would be more apparent than what was able to be captured for the album.  (Orig- Easy Lovin Stranger)<br /><br />6. Guitars Jim Beam and Waylon- Like Humbolt County this is another instance where the new arrangement really benefits the song.  Like many other songs on this album the original is more melodic, but in my opinion this version captures the essence of the song better.  (Orig- Gypsies and Drifters)<br /><br />7. Blue Agave- The live version on Live, Locked and Loaded is easily the best version of this song, better than the original and by far better than this.  The live version is great, this version annoys the hell out of me.  (Orig- Hollow Eyed & Wasted)<br /><br />8. Cocaine (Acoustic)- Kind of like how Dancing in the Dark was the song that pulled the Born in the USA album together for Bruce Springsteen, this is the song that holds Bad Juju together as an album and puts the rest of the songs in context.  Like Dancing in the Dark, the loneliness of the protagonist in the original version of Cocaine (on Aces and Eights) is somewhat hidden in the arrangement- which in the case of Cocaine is  very much kick ass by the way.  So, with this new acoustic version Jackson Taylor makes the loneliness crystal clear to the listener, and it works perfectly.  Although I much prefer the original version, I think the acoustic version is very good in its own right.  (Orig- Aces and Eights)<br /><br />9. Whiskey- Like a few of the others, the new arrangement on this song left me scratching my head, it doesn't add anything to the original.  (Orig- Easy Lovin Stranger)<br /><br />10. The Girl With Auburn Hair- Not sure if this is a JT/S original or not, but it is a damn funny song.  Again, one that only Jackson could pull of.<br /><br />For Jackson Taylor fans, this album is a logical extension of Let the Bad Times Roll.  It's almost like Jackson let out all his frustrations about the current state of America on LTBTR and had to take a step back to recenter himself by putting out an intimate album that is purely Sinners; in your face, stripped to the bare essentials.  Although it is not my favorite of his albums, you can crank it and kick back on your back porch with a beer and enjoy this the whole way through.

Payne is back and Rockstar has made it better than ever.<br />My 4 star rating has almost nothing to do with the gameplay itself and blame for the downgrade is solely on the developers or Amazon who thought it'd be a great idea to package this in a massive 26GB download that took 16+ hours to download and my internet speed is no slouch. I heard the retail (box) version consists of 4 DVDs so the size is understandable. However, the download should've been split into more manageable chunks. My download disconnected several times (most likely due to high traffic) but would resume moments later. That was a good thing. Unfortunately, my first download attempt had an unknown error as the download package was extracting. It failed... and my Amazon Downloader failed to restart until I trashed the first file. No choice but to start over. 16 more hours later, my second attempt completed, the extraction succeeded(another 30 minutes) and finally I was ready to install (yet another 45 minutes). After the install was complete, it was finally GO TIME!! Except, the games auto-updater kicked in and I had to wait for updates to install (Really? One day out and it needs updates?) Okay, updates done....ready?! Nope not quite. Next you have to create a login (if you don't have one) for Rockstar's Social Club. Grrrr! I never heard of the Social Club. I assume it has to do with multiplayer, match-making, kill-tracking, that sort of thing. It frustrated me because I HAVE NO INTEREST IN MULTIPLAYER at this point. This is not just a Max Payne gripe. This goes out to all developers: Stop making me create unwanted logins just to enjoy the SINGLE PLAYER part of your game!!!<br />Login created, I marched forward...only to have the game lock up on me and refuse to start! Stangely enough, that was the easiest problem to fix. I started by running it in safe mode with just Direct X9. Ugly, but I got to at least see the game opening and shoot up a few bad guys. Exhausted, I went to bed only to have the (obvious) answer slap me awake Sunday morning. Driver Updates! I hadn't played a high-end game since Skyrim and my ATI Sapphire Radeon 5770 was running on 2011 drivers. A quick trip over to AMD for updates and I was good to go and with Direct X11 beauty to boot.<br /><br />All headaches aside, this is one fun game. I pre-ordered this one solely to get a fresh digital copy of Payne 2 and reacquaint myself first. I really worried that a new publisher could possibly ruin the series for me. Boy was I wrong. Rockstar took everything that hooked me about the previous 2 titles and gave them a dose of steroids. Graphics are fantastic, inside and outside, San Paulo or New York. The game is gorgeous to look at and even more fun to destroy.<br />Cut scenes are frequent but seamless with the action. They really drive the story along, give you a breather and provide for logical checkpoints within the story. Don't bother looking for \""Quick Save\"" or \""Quick Load\"". You're at the mercy of the checkpoint system but so far that hasn't caused serious issues for me.<br /><br />The reason I don't mind the checkpoints is because EVEN DYING IS FUN on this game. If I storm into a room, bullet time-on, guns blazing and get my a$$ handed to me... no problem, I come in next time, use the cover system, and pick my enemies off smartly. The game forces you to be flexible, which I love. Location based damage is implemented like I've never seen before. Shoot an enemy in the crotch and watch him hold his junk with one hand while trying to shoot back with the other. It's hilarious. Or kneecap a guy and watch him fold like paper while running for cover. Blast guys over railings, down stairs or wait for them to show just a little bit of scalp from behind cover so you can shoot it off. Damage does seem to be off in some cases. Riddle a guy with 10 bullets to the chest, he may recover as you run past him and take you out. I've even seen guys recover from multiple headshots. But others, depending on the weapon, you can watch as facial features are destroyed, eyes are removed, and bullets come out the backs of skulls in a very satisfying way.<br /><br />They have put way more detail into the visual and physics aspects of the game than before particularly during shoot-dodge. Try to shoot-dodge into a wall, you will bounce back and look silly doing it. At the completion of a shootdodoge, if Max is lying prone on the floor, he will stay there until you make him move again. Good for continuing to shoot while laying low...bad if the enemy is standing right next to you. Speaking of which, Max incorporates melee skills into the mix if you run up on an enemy as well. Take him down, UFC-style, then put a bullet in his face. Too cool. Other details include minor things like he actually takes a second to pause while popping pain pills and drops the empty bottle behind him.<br /><br />On \""Normal\"" level, be prepared to run out of ammo and you will never have a surplus of pain pills. The most I've held at one time while full of life is 3. You will get shot and you will get shot a lot. Another cool effect is how images will flicker and almost cause you to see double as Max takes damage...then see things quickly shift to focus one you down a couple pills. AI is good but not perfect. Enemies will flank you, toss grenades to drive you from cover, even tag-team to keep your head down while another guy reloads. It requires a little cat-and-mouse play along with the reckless abandonment that will sometimes cause you to say \""screw it\"" and run out shooting. I like the weapons carrying system. You can have 1 primary, 1 secondary, and 1 2-handed weapon. Max will hold the 2-handed weapon at his side while you use a handgun or submachine gun. If you decide to dual-wield the primary & secondary weapons, you'll drop the 2 handed one. Don't complain...it's fair...I love that games are doing away with this \""carry all you want\"" approach to weapons.<br /><br />Can't give any multiplayer review as I'm content with the campaign for now.<br /><br />All in all, intitial frustrations aside, this is an awesome game. It was worth the 10 year wait (eat it Diablo fans!).

We watched a parade of people telling us how great the Gerson Therapy is and at the end we still had no idea what the Gerson Therapy was.<br /><br />We got the impression that if we sent $39.99 somewhere we could find out.<br /><br />You get just enough info to ascertain it's a juice and coffee enema diet.  I guess I don't need to know why puffing organic coffee up my butt is good for me or not.<br /><br />Never mind if the info presented is correct, never mind if it cures cancer or anything else because the info just isn't there.  You do get tidbits of info such as over half the patients at a clinic in Japan are either cured or in remission after following the Gerson Therapy.  This statistic is meaningless when you don't put it in some sort of context.<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />1.  How many patients are cured?<br /><br />2.  How many are cured vs in remission?<br /><br />3.  What standard was used to determine \""cured\""?<br /><br />4.  What standard was used to determine \""in remission\""?<br /><br />5.  What sort of confounding variables might be at play?  I assume this regimen restricts calories, processed foods and by extension sugar intake.  Since cancer cells lose the ability to reproduce aerobically and rely on anaerobic activity to reproduce, one could logically form the hypothesis that would allow you to ask the question, was this a confounding variable.  Many others could also be raised.<br /><br />In fact, according to \""Overview of the Gerson Regimen\"". Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. March 18, 2009. Updated April 22, 2009.  Alt medical facilities have a poor track record of accounting for confounding variables and state the following when they tried to critique Gerson's literature, \""A serious flaw in this study is its failure to control for additional variable therapies used by patients, and failure to specify any prior or concurrent conventional treatments used.\""<br /><br />6.  Why have the people for the Gerson Therapy not applied for the NCI (National Cancer Institute) Best Case Series Program?  If they have and have been denied and they have complied with all NCI criteria, then they should be screaming about this.  It should have been in this documentary.  It should have been in 4 more documentaries.  It should have been on there website, paid print, billboards and anywhere else you could write the words \""shafted by the system.\""  It isn't, because I don't think they have and I don't believe they intend to.<br /><br />According to  ^ \""Gerson Therapy Overview\"". National Cancer Institute. September 6, 2007.  Updated April 22, 2009.  The National Cancer Institute states, \""The NCI Best Case Series Program, which was started in 1991, is one way Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients' medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.\""<br /><br />Worst case scenario they could fund there own double blind study and at least get the \""no published hard data\"" monkey off their backs.<br /><br /> At the end of the day, what anyone wants to know is this; If one opted for the Gerson therapy would your odds of survival be greater than or less than that of traditional treatments?  The Gerson therapy does not have to bat .1000 but it does need to bat greater than something else.  At the end of my day this documentary did nothing but parade a bunch of people at me, telling me a story that if true, God bless em'.  What I want to know is how many people can't tell me their stories because they didn't make it.<br /><br />These are questions that could be answered.  These are questions that need to be answered.  This is in no way a complete list of questions that should be answered.  This documentary does not even ask these questions so if you're looking for answers...skip this one.<br /><br />I would like to conclude on a positive point lightly touched by this documentary.<br /><br />What is the true cause of cancer and most diseases in our society today?<br /><br />I think the film hit it dead center.  Toxicity.  When our bodies toxicity surpasses its ability to overcome that toxicity, I believe we begin to suffer all sorts of problems.  Cancer and a whole host of other diseases is an acute manifestation of our body's inability to regulate itself.  Remove the factors that caused the toxicity and you give yourself a chance to heal.  That may be one of the reasons why the Gerson therapy may or may not be effective.<br /><br />However, I can't tell from this documentary, it doesn't go that deep.",2012-01-08,859,extra_long,2012-01,videos

You realized this was not the pretties of colors, but maybe you made the best of it and made a dark forest, or possibly, a turd.<br /><br />When you're alone in your car, in your shower, or placed directly in front of a box-fan, you may be at a higher risk of belting out sour and random notes along with the radio or the sound of the world's ambiance. Your tonality and expression don't hold much weight, because who's going to judge you when you're alone?<br /><br />When constructs and limitations are lifted, creative art can thrive. Unfortuantely, without self-constraint these absenses of limitations will lead to disasterous results. Take a look at the product of any photoshop newbie who discovered every filter in the menu and applied them all to the same photo until it was nearly unrecognizable.<br /><br />On Of Montreal's (Kevin Barnes) latest release, Paralytic Stalks, Barne's lyrics and production represent a very post-modern point a view. That is, all truth is relative.<br /><br />Musically, the album is a tour of the last 40 years of music history. This album contains shades of the avante garde, post-punk, psycadelic, funk, rock, emo, new wave, and piano rock. There simply wasn't a crayon in the box that Barnes didn't pull out. Sadly, few songs on the album conclude without a journey through at least two or three of the above mentioned genres. This results in a frustrating and confusing listening experience.<br /><br />Lyrically, Barnes rails against his mothers religion, humanity, himself, purpose, and social mores.  Barnes sings on the opening lines of the albums second song, \""Spiteful Intervention\"" It's F'ng sad that we need a tragedy to occur to gain a fresh perspective in our lives / nothing happens for a reason / there's no point to them pretending / you know this as truth as well as I!<br /><br />With such personal and convoluted lyrics that rail against conventions, Barnes sings many of the lyrics without restraint and care for melody and pitch. His closed throated falsetto is thrown in the middle of a building groove or melody. Just when you think, yeah, this is starting to get good, Barnes throws in a freaky twist, musically or with his voice - often to a disastrous result.<br /><br />Even more distracting throughout the album was the audio balancing. You often have to put your speakers at full volume to discern what it is Barnes is singing, yelping, or whisper talking between the dozen instruments playing.<br /><br />If you've ever had the experience of starting one youtube video while forgetting you already have music playing, you get this accidental mix of beats, lyrics, and styles that makes the two songs unlistenable. Listening to this album all the way through will have you thinking at least once, What is going on here? Do I have another song playing, or is my phone going off?<br /><br />Some of the unique soundscapes that will cross your ears will include, the sound jeans make in the dryer, the score to every alien first-person shooter game you've ever played, what a ray gun might sound like, window chimes, and many, many, more odd sounds.<br /><br />Overall, the album turns into an abstract landscape that will likely pull unique listening experiences from those with different expectations and probably appeal to the most ironic of hipsters. But with a singer lost in a world he considers meaningless, and recording largely alone these days, he produced an album that despite it's many colors, tries to be too many things and turned out to be a convoluted pukeish sounding turd.<br /><br />1.5 out of 5 stars<br /><br />(Originally posted on my blog [...])",2012-02-12,649,extra_long,2012-02,music

This is the MMO We've Been Waiting For","Funcom as a developer has had a somewhat checkered history among gamers.  While Anarchy Online, its earlier title, had a strong yet small following, Age of Conan disappointed many due to its premature release, which was reflected in a lack of content and many bugs in various game systems.  So, to be quite honest, I didn't expect anything in particular at all from The Secret World, other than perhaps a better version of The Matrix Online.<br /><br />Well.<br /><br />Funcom has created a secret masterpiece.  The Secret World is an MMO which, in many ways, reflects the desires of MMO fans who have been playing the genre for 10+ years, and want something different from yet another clone of World of Warcraft.  And this game delivers that, on pretty much all levels.<br /><br />The gameplay is reminiscent of other 3D MMOs, yet the action system is different, being based on synergies between skills and weapon choices.  The game affords the player the flexibility to choose their own skills in whatever way they wish -- which also allows players to mess up their decisions with an old school approach of having to live with one's mistakes in this regard.  As a result, the game has a steep learning curve, but rewards players who want more complexity in their MMO experience as compared with most of the offerings since 2004.<br /><br />The mechanics of the game involve the familiar quest system, yet in TSW the focus is very, very heavy on story telling (even more than in TOR, the first MMO to focus heavily on story telling .. and it has quite better writing than TOR does as well).  And quest design is not monolithic.  There are storyline quests and main quests and then side quests -- and the main quests can be either combat, investigation (puzzle solving) or sabotage (stealth) in nature.  This makes for a very diverse gameplay set as compared with almost any other 3D MMO.  Quests advance in \""tiers\"", and the story focus is underscored by a strict limit on the kind and number of quests one can be \""working on\"" at any one time (gone are the days of going to a quest hub, loading up on its quests, and powerleveling through them to \""level as efficiently as possible\"" -- you are following stories here that have their own pace).  And speaking of leveling -- there are no levels, either, but rather Action Points (used to purchase new abilities) and Skill Points (used to upgrade abilities in weapons and armor slots) which are rewarded based on experience and certain quest completion.  The player can allocate these in any way they wish (there are no set classes), although research is recommended to optimize one's choice -- in that sense, the degree of complexity and prep required is moving in the direction of EVE Online, although not nearly as complex as EVE is.<br /><br />I will say this, however.  If you are looking for a light-hearted pew-pew type game, this is not that.  If you don't want to invest time to learn the game's systems (which are not really like the familiar MMO systems), you won't like this game.  If you are looking for another game where you can rush to max level and look around \""to see what the endgame is like\"", then you won't like it either.  As a result, I believe this is a niche game, similar in that respect as well to EVE Online -- a game that will appeal to a certain segment of gamers, but not the \""mass market\"" of MMO gamers like WoW or TOR or GW2.<br /><br />So... if you're a bit of an experienced and jaded MMO gamer who is looking for something a bit different, a bit more complex, and quite a bit less mainstream, give TSW a try.  It's a great game for people who are looking for the kind of experience it offers.ts one can be \""working on\"" at any one time (gone are the days of going to a quest hub, loading up on its quests, and powerleveling through them to \""level as efficiently as possible\"" -- you are following stories here that have their own pace).

The world's oldest college students must learn to balance their love of girls, partying at the cafeteria, their upcoming fraternity pledging, and spending hours watching autopsies.  The terror part is that Lewis Moffett is a top notch student who is hiding a secret fear.  The movie is watchable but no this is not even close to being a scary movie (besides the receding hairlines of the actors).<br /><br />Riffs: Despite the weak movie, Joel and the bots are up to the challenge with a lot of funny riffs.  They seem to have a lot of fun in this one and it does help to offset the tedium of the movie.<br /><br />The Host Segments: The inventions in the opening segment are probably the most clever I have seen on the show (in fact, I might just steal the ideas for next Halloween) and I always like the ram chip segments.  The rest are pretty funny until the mads decide to mix things up a little bit.<br /><br />Other:  The mads play a very cruel joke in this episode.  I really thought the episode was over but then the mads surprised the SOL crew (and me) by making them watch a Bela Lugosi serial.  The serial might have been good but I was confused as I never saw the first two parts and the opening scroll explaining the background story flew across the screen.  You can really feel the fun get sucked out of the episode as the riffing was not very good during this short.  This is one of the few times when the episode would have been so much better if MST3k didn't have to stick the 1 ½ hour schedule.<br /><br />Overall: Until the serial, this is a very good (almost a top 10) episode.  The movie does have some goofy funny parts to keep you involved and the riffing and segments are some of the better efforts.  But seriously the serial at the end really ruins the episode.  If you are a casual viewer, I would suggest just ending the episode after the end of the movie.",2012-08-30,421,long,2012-08,videos

This awesome début is a journey of pure musical bliss that takes you to technically and emotionally vibrant territories.<br />I'm not exaggerating; this album is one of the best things that happened to me this year. My observation is that they quickly found their place in the prog-metal scene right next to the big ones up there!<br />I have given it a lot listens even before I decided to review this album and my favourite tracks changed at every spin... I think we all know what that means... Yes it's a testament to how many gems there are in this album...You know it gets really hard to pick a favourite.<br />These tight bunch apparently used my favourite formula in this album: proggy + heavy + melodic + technical + emotional = WIN! Hence the enthusiasm...<br />I couldn't find any misses in this album.. seriously it hit me hard...<br />On to the songs<br />Delusions is a hell of an opener. It starts at a very tasty tempo with the drums and guitars and a pinch of keys.  We already have a taste of what's to come.... The moment Jonny chimes in with his amazing voice, the most harmonious and tastiest of sounds emerge... Eumeria sound! The first time you hear Jonny hit a high note, you'll definitely go whoa! Just perfect! Lyrics are very good and very well delivered. When he goes \""don't give a damn about you\"" you instantly side with him and start hating to whomever he is referring in the song! Very powerful elocution! Serious goosebumps! As a personal side, that line is the hallmark of the track for me - it builds up to a good sense of climax. Some epic riffs at about 2:20 minute mark follow... But mind you, those are only an introduction before the brilliant instrumental feast with the sizzling bass-work, impossible keys and the awesome unison section which I personally love!  And that killer line again... What kind of sorcery is this?!<br />Rebel Mind is a tightly arranged, melodic-as-hell, and extremely catchy tune... It is like a showcase (in a good way) of what the band members can do - I must have listened to it a million times! (I know it would mean I'd be a time traveller from 10 years ahead... sue me). It is still very impressive... Again, what kind of sorcery is this?? I don't know where to begin... The out-of-this-earth guitars? The I-am-stumped-as-to-where-these-are-from keys? Technical and emotional capacity of the vocals? I am not that good an author as to be able to convey the beauty of this tune, sadly... It's perfectly arranged and mixed as well... Seriously, It's an example of how a catchy proggy song should be structured...<br />The keys halfway through the tune is so powerful that my head exploding was accompanied by my admiration of Bobby reaching its zenith.<br />I reckon they know of all these and so shot the first video for this song - it is a deft move since the song is what you want to listen to if you are looking for a good sample that can tell as much to you as possible about the band. The song is just brilliant from start to its end at 7:05 mark and it has just the perfect length. But right at this point I'd like say that I am expecting some epics from these guys as well... Just saying<br />A personal side note here:  the title track struck me hard the first time I listened to it but I am not alone since I made a very long list of prog-head friends on various social media platforms thanks to it! What brought us together was nothing more than the brilliance of the song and our immediately developed fandom. /fangirlism<br />In brief, it's a masterpiece which keeps growing on you... Sometimes it's the opening riff, sometimes it's the guitar or keys solos, sometimes it's the very catchy chorus and the epic delivery, sometimes it's Kevin's unbelievable drumming or Shawn's aggressive bass lines... But every time, it's a blissful seven minutes!<br />Father... Ha! You know it is a tough job to make me like a ballad. But something in this one touched me... Keys kick the song off and the song has a soft and brooding air about it. Jonny is ridiculously talented in inducing emotions - sadness, in this case.  If you follow my work you know this is something I actively seek in music. Keys at around 3 minute mark is absolutely amazing... I think Bobby is going to be up there with the prog key legends.<br />The feeling of sadness, great vocals, great lyrics - all work perfectly. I believe they were not concerned about making this song flashy at all; they are storytellers of great calibre and here, they just put together masterfully what is needed for the best telling of the story.<br />Tides starts off with an uplifting vibe and then shredding guitars and drums join in.  After the first minute, the song turns into a dark and atmospheric ballad with killer riffs. Seriously, very impressive riffs. Then the track builds up into something else again sneakily - which means that I probably need to stop trying to classify it. The vocals at 2:39 mark are brilliant - and yes, I am talking about a two second bit of vocals and it is a detail very worthy of mentioning. It gets heavy and wild at the 3 minute mark and about a minute later keys and guitars solos in succession are awesome! Once again, it is clear that we are listening to a very talented bunch.<br />In their awesomeness, they take you through a journey full of different vibes and emotions.<br />All those jarring sections shake you emotionally.  We have Jonny screaming, then cooling down. The contrast is compelling.  I love the idea... Awesomeness!<br />The Key is another awesome song... Heavy and fast as hell... Very aggressive riffs and then nice mellow bridge followed by the an awesome instrumentation where Reece is stealing the song for a while with a wild, I mean wild solo section beforeJon chiming in with his powerful singing and lyrics... \""Out of the circle I walk alone.. Drive this fiction from every home\""<br />As the end of the album nears, Dreaming of Death owns me at the first second with the heavy intro... The riff at the 1 minute mark... Oh my god. My anticipation builds up in the background... Nothing lets me down... a proper prog-metal track...<br />The song is chuck full of technical expertise - it is impossible to break down the intensity of brilliance.<br />The tune calms down before leaving you as if bowing its head to the closing track in respect. Truly awe inspiring.<br />And finally the closing tune, Secret Places... This is one of the best closing I've seen in a good while. The tune has very good distorted guitar riffs and near the end of the first minute mark, a very catchy chorus that utilises Jon's voice range quite expertly kicks off. The beautiful bridge afterwards adds to the awesomeness and the song compels you to listen to the whole thing in an enchanted state without losing anything from its tempo. Instrument work is brilliant with heavenly guitar melodies. After the two minute mark, Jonny's screams blend in with the shredding guitars before the beautifully done key work accompanied by some heavy drumming. And you will hear some very good melodies until it ends with the awesome chorus.<br />The whole tune is a thing of beauty without any exceptions among sections. Such a brilliant way to close an album, it is pure genius!<br />Yeah you must have already figured that I fell in love with Jon's stellar range.  The fact that he used to play the drums and the keys and then (to our absolute delight as prog-heads) switched to vocals makes him a very well rounded musician. Of course, this shows on his vocal performance. You know those who played other instruments and switched to vocals are traditionally good at it (*cough* Labrie and drums *cough*).<br />The members, without exception, are stellar musicians. You will see this when you listen to the album.<br />As a final note, I think this album is essential for every prog-library... Don't miss out.",2012-05-08,1415,extra_long,2012-05,music

The greatest value of the book is the insights not stressed by other authors.  Consider the Greeks, for instance.  Their speeches were eloquent.  Andrii says you would be wrong to think that eloquence is a mark of a great speaker.  He observes that everyday speech and writing in former times was generally more eloquent, and that audiences would have expected it.  People today talk simply, and a speech should use everyday language.  He even says that a speech should not be perfect.  Like a lady with a beauty mark, a small flaw here and there gives a speech authenticity, freshness.<br /><br />Andrii stresses purpose more than structure.  Having a firm idea of why you are giving a speech, what your objective is, is more important than the formalities of organization.  A speaker's objective should be to connect with the audience, and in doing so, to offer them something which makes it worth listening.  The speech should motivate, offer advice, inform, or entertain the audience.  Whichever it is, the focus is the audience, not the speaker.  Much of the advice he shares deals with making a bond with the audience, as a collective, but especially as individuals.  A simple one is to use the word \""you\"" frequently, \""I\"" infrequently.  Another is to make meaningful eye contact with individual members of an audience.  A third is to move into the audience at least once during a speech.<br /><br />Fine, you may say, you have heard those before.  Let's move on to some points I'll bet very few have read about - but which common sense immediately tells you must be true.<br />1. You create a hologram as you move on the stage.  Each part of your speech is identified with the part of the stage from which it was delivered.  As you refer back to previous points, moving back to that part of the stage provides emphasis, and in many instances movement alone saves you explaining the backwards reference.<br />2. You can create a timeline of holograms moving across the stage.  This may seem somewhat obvious.  What is only obvious after Andrii tells you is that direction matters a lot!  We read from left to right.  Timelines proceed left to right.  Therefore, on stage, your timeline hologram should move from stage right (your right) to stage left.<br />3. Three is a magic number, as you see in these bullet points.  An audience is conditioned to expect information in threes.  That is fairly common knowledge.  The third point may be a continuation or capstone of the first two, or, especially for the purposes of humor, it may stand in contrast.  When you compile such triplets, Andrii recommends that you make a list for potential entries in the 1-2 position, a second list of entries for #3, and only then consider the combination that will pack the most punch.<br /><br />The biggest secret of all is telling a story.  People love listening to stories, while they don't especially relish being lectured at.  Therefore, to the extent that you can, cast your message in terms of anecdotes rather than statistics.  Use dialog rather than narrative.  Make the sentences short and dramatic.  Make full use of movement, gesture, and intonation where they can be used to carry the story, even letting them take the place of words when you can.  Andrii offers several techniques for wrapping the audience into the story.  You can perhaps cast one of the roles onto a nearby member of the audience.  You might elicit an oral response from the audience.<br /><br />Your story can't be a total lie, but it is legitimate to rearrange details to improve the flow.  Here's my example.<br /><br />\""Oksana,\"" I said, \""I think I've got a book review offer I'm going to accept.\""<br />She nodded.  The fact that as a Top 1000 reviewer I get quite a few such offers doesn't matter much to her.  \""Why?\"" she asked, without much interest.<br />\""It's by a Ukrainian guy who has been active in Toastmasters.  When I saw how he spelled his name, I answered him in Russian and he answered right back.  He's from Kiev.\""<br />\""Anybody I know?\""<br />\""Don't think so.\""<br />A few moments later, reading the book, wham!  Andrii's speech about his dancing career was something I had heard before!<br /> \""Oksana, guess what!  Do you remember that speech by the guy who tried so hard to get into a Ukrainian dance troupe, got rejected, and finally came in through the back door?\""<br />\""Yes, it was excellent!\""<br />\""It's the guy!  The guy who wrote the book I'm reviewing.\""<br /><br />Putting this short anecdote into dialog form makes it shorter and more interesting.  You can picture how I would change my voice (slightly, Andrii recommends - no falsetto!) to represent my wife speaking.  I don't have to express my surprise in words - you could hear it in my voice.  Using dialog would make the whole story more compact, and more interesting.<br /><br />A review should be a teaser, something to interest you in buying the book rather than something to read instead of the book.  I'll close in saying that I'm a fairly experienced public speaker, having delivered something approaching 50 speeches in my career in Toastmasters and many more in my professional life.  In spite of this wealth of experience, just about every page offered me a fresh insight.  The upshot is that I'm going to totally rewrite my upcoming speech, and I can already see how much better it will be.  I expect that most people who buy this book will have similar happy experiences.en I saw how he spelled his name, I answered him in Russian and he answered right back.

I think they may want to, for their next album, cover another band's tunes in their musical style<br /><br />The problem with this production is you want to hear the words to some of these songs. It would make for a better CD. The instruments overshadow the lyrics in most of the tracks. Some of the music cuts seem to have some great lyrical poetry. I wish I had a booklet in this CD with lyrics printed out. Some of this album sounds a lot like like an early Elton John album \""Captain Fantastic and The Brown Dirt Cowboy\""...another attempt that almost worked in my opinion.<br /><br />The songs on the CD blend nicely one into another with a few hard, edgier tunes. Fast tracks into the slower musical cuts makes for easier listening. However, most of the music over basses itself in many tunes in the mix, making the many of the songs vocals (the words) seem tinny...almost as if they were wanting to play this CD as a club set played live... Which would be great for their next CD.<br /><br />The mix by Scott Murdock is muddled, musically, at best, as the instruments seem closer to the microphones than the singers are.

Your work is ingenious. It's quality work.  And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Just cut a few and it will be perfect\"" to which Mozart replies, \""Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?\""<br /><br />I open with this quote - not because I feel that Rob Balducci's work on Violet Horizon has \""too many notes\"" but, to state what Mozart implied, every note on this album is excellently written, perfectly placed, and not one  excessive in the slightest.  I would wager if one note was removed from this masterful work of guitar art, the masterpiece would implode on itself.<br /><br />Violet Horizon is a work of musical genius wherein each and every song conjures up rich, vivid and brilliant mental images and deep, heartfelt moods from within the listener.  If the listener goes the extra step by listening to this album through a pair of excellent headphones, they're liable to fall through an stereophonic rabbit hole, never to return.<br /><br />Nor would they want to.<br /><br />The title track from the album sets the tone for the rest of the disc. Images of dawn or sunset and the moods such a scene evokes is melodically recreated in this two minute tune.  Immediately following is the song, Friction. I'm not sure what Rob had in mind when he wrote this song but, in my mind, the song is what I experience in my typical work day after I've soaked in the tranquility of a Violet Horizon.<br /><br />Another beautifully frenetic tune is Devil's Juice, that features some incredible solo work by guest guitarist, Dave Weiner (second guitar in Steve Vai's band).  Another great duet on the album is Sleestack with UK guitarist, Guthrie Govan.  Both of these tunes are special treats that you'll not want to miss.<br /><br />Don't even try to make me pick a favorite. I couldn't do it if I tried. I love the whole album.  However, songs like Trinity cause me to think of Christ's trek on the Via Dolorosa and the agony of His passion.

It made no statement or impression whatsoever. I did not like the cover. Authors, please put some effort into your book covers.<br />Characters: There was a good mixture of characters in the story. Talia Lyons is the main character and I didn’t like her too much. She’s 17 and very immature. She started arguments with her boyfriend for no reason (and the fight just seemed forced on the reader); her temper flares at the slightest provocation; and she’s horrible at her job as a Hunter. Her boyfriend, Donovan…well, I can’t really describe him without giving away the story. Let’s just say he was okay in the beginning but I knew something was off about him as the story progressed. Erik, Talia’s cabin mate (that’s right, she has two male roommates) was my favorite character. He’s painted as a lady’s man at first, but I could tell he had a heart of gold. Team Erik right here!! That’s right, there’s a lust triangle but I didn’t mind it. The author didn’t force it on us and one of the guys is a douche so…no real choice there.<br />Conflict: Talia’s parents are killed by rebel forces and she joins the TOXIC team in order to avenge her parents’ murder; at least that is the plan, eventually. I thought this was to be the plot but we don’t see her really pursuing that avenue until the last chapters of the book. The rest of the chapters are her sucking at being a Hunter, her childish, outlandish temper tantrums, and the lust triangle between her, Erik, and Donovan. I liked the way the story developed so we could share in her journey. But in the beginning, the story kept jumping from present to backstory and I just felt it would have been better to get all dream sequencing done in one swoop rather than going back and forth—it would have flowed better.<br />Villain: To me, the villain makes the story. They have the all-rights pass to be as bad as they want to be. I find it interesting how each writer takes advantage of this opportunity to project evil genius into characters. But there really isn’t a villain in this story. We’re made to believe that Ian, the guy responsible for Talia’s parents murder, is the bad guy but I’m already leery of government propaganda so when TOXIC injects this perception into Talia’s head, I didn’t buy that he was the villain.

The objective that Talia was training to complete was completed but it leaves her unconscious in the end (like I stated, she sucks at being a Hunter).

He returns home, finds his family savaged and ravaged, and draws the ire of the female detective investigating the crime.

Seventh Magpie, that legendary mischievous creature. From the moment you read the title, you know you're in for something mystical and spiritual,and Ms. Sharrock doesn't disappoint. At the same time, the book is firmly placed at the center of the human heart. No frothy, bubbly faerie stuff here.<br /><br />The book spans four centuries--1606 to 2060--opening with a Welsh witch burning, then jumping to a post-apocalyptic time travel adventure, then returning to times in between. We soon realize we're following the descendants of that original witch through time and the world--oh, and the descendants of her parents, too, who are not exactly 17th century folks. The central focus eventually settles on the 1980's and Helen, a woman truly caught in the middle. She begins to realize her paranormal abilities, fights them, but eventually follows her visions, and is left with the burden of knowledge of the spellbinding past and present as well as the armageddon future. And she has to decide what she can or should do to stop it all from happening.<br /><br />And the magpie? Well, he's been there all along. Watching, delivering messages, waiting for the moment. And of course, we're waiting, too, wondering what that moment is and what will happen when it comes. How can we have a 400-year-old magpie?

This is a documentary for anyone interested in filmmaking, cameras, or just people who love movies!<br /><br />Almost everyone now embraces the digital methods of editing, postproduction, and color timing.  It's only in the image capture that some filmmakers still prefer film.  And with good reason - there are qualities to film that have yet to be replicated in digital.  \""Side by Side\"" looks at the pros and cons of going digital.  For example, one obvious pro is that it is far less expensive for both the studios and independent filmmakers to shoot digitally because fewer resources are used and the day runs more efficiently (no need to change film magazines every 10 minutes).  But one major concern is the storage of digital movies - there have been over 80 digital file formats over the past few decades, and most of them are already obsolete.  By contrast, under the proper conditions a film print can be preserved for over one hundred years.<br /><br />The documentary asks some of Hollywood's most respected and influential filmmakers to give their views on the film vs. digital debate.  On one side, you have filmmakers like James Cameron (\""Avatar\"") who are advocates of digital technology and want to continue to explore new tools that can be used to tell the story.  On the other hand, there are filmmakers like Christopher Nolan (\""The Dark Knight\"") who think that film is still the most reliable format and produces the highest quality image, and would like to see celluloid remain a viable option in the years to come.<br /><br />Other notable individuals interviewed include: George Lucas, Danny Boyle, David Fincher, Wally Pfister, Walter Murch, Lars von Trier, and Steven Soderbergh.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese (\""Taxi Driver\"", \""Hugo\"") says it best when he says it should be \""up to the filmmaker\"" - he believes that both options should be available to directors and cinematographers (and as someone who has used both formats, his opinion is certainly valid).  Unfortunately, it looks like everyone will be forced to go digital at some point.  All the major camera companies have stopped development of film cameras, and are now in production on digital cameras.  And movie theaters are converting to digital projection at a high rate.<br /><br />In my opinion, the \""digital revolution\"" is very exciting and the technology is improving, but it would be a shame to see film completely disappear.

This book makes no sense what so ever.  The main character \""Scotty\"" makes some of the most bizarre choices and yet has the most illogical reactions to the world around him it left me baffled to the point where I finished reading simply for the humor of what \""Scotty would do next.\""<br /><br />(Semi-Spoilers)<br />The author obviously has honor as a driving point for Scotty's actions in life, however it's a very strange definition of honor.  Essentially if you agree with \""Scotty\"" and bow down to his whims then you are deemed 'honorable', if not your summarily executed on the spot.<br /><br />'Scotty' also has a incredibly odd sense of ethics, in one instance he'll save a wounded enemy in the belief that \""all creatures should be treated with compassion\"" after a brief discussion and learning that his enemy can communicate mere days later 'Scotty' is committing genocide on it's behalf.<br /><br />Also the authors efforts to \""super size\"" his battles makes very little sense and shows a facet of the writers skill set that definitely could use some coaching.  If 20 people fighting against 100 is a grand heroic battle then 200 vs 10,000 must be EPIC!  Over and over again the author simply throws out some unimaginably large numbers which take away from the opportunities to develop his characters and their interactions with each other, simply each battle turns into \""another hoard of 10,000 XYZ approached our lines we doubted we could hold out, but Scotty refused to give up, hence we won the day!\"" Yay Scotty!<br /><br />The incredibly advanced technology of the sentient battleships encountered also is another spot where the writers missed opportunities.  With a detachment between primitives thinking like primitives and seemingly all powerful ships you would think spending a chapter trying to figure out how to attach a white prosperous arrow head to their blowguns so they could kill 4 giant tigers would have been a moot point when Scotty asks the ship to \""teleport\"" him down to the surface of the planet within 100 meters of the enemy so he could shoot it with said arrow. You would think a sentient battleship that's already decimated the planet once could offer a suggestion better than arrowheads.  My thinking the whole time was  \""Well if you can teleport why not simply relocate the offending tigers to another location on the planet (or into space if you deemed they were not honorable)\"".<br /><br />The author has some very good ideas and does a reasonably good job of describing the world setting he's placed his characters in.  However, working on describing battles without the reliance on giving the actual numbers involved would go a long way to improving the way to approach the topic by forcing you to bring the reader down to the battle rather than making them sit through a power point presentation on the topic.<br /><br />Read up on morality and ethics also.

I loved Battlefield 42 and Vietnam. I had a blast with Battlefield Bad Company 2. I preordered this game, hoping it would be fantastic. I wanted to show my support for the series. I feel like I've been spit upon by EA or the developers.<br /><br />I'll start with the good things. It looks great. Some boards are a bit too blue, and others, it should be as blue as it is. The tanks roll smoothly, and the boost to speed is nice. I like the different options you have for the tanks, and other vehicles, as BF was always big on vehicles. There are many guns (too many for me), and the four classes all have their benefits and roles in the game. I like the squads on multiplayer, but most people who are in a squad don't seem to understand teamwork (More of a gripe about other players than the game). I loved the co-op play, but sadly, it only has six missions. I have experienced a few bugs in the co-op mode, like being unable to get into a vehicle, or to open a door I'm supposed to open. The co-op always felt more like what I thought BF should be, rather than my online multiplayer experience. The single player campaign is pretty good, and you get to experience things through more than one person's eyes.<br /><br />The negative. I feel that the people who preordered Battlefield 3 have been spit upon by the company. We all paid around $45-$60 to get our copies. You got one expansion pack (Back to Karkand) for free. Now they've come out with Battlefield 3 Premium, for $50ish, and it includes all the expansion packs. So, now if I want to play Armored Kill, Close Quarters, or any of the other expansion packs, I have to pay additional money. At $15 each, if I were to buy each expansion pack, I'd have well over $100 in the game. I supported DICE and EA early on, and got shafted. I should have waited, and then I could have the entire game, all the expansion packs, for about what I paid for my preorder. The lesson this has taught meis to wait to buy a game. Never to preorder, as if you wait, you'll get more than if you support a company early on. Thanks Dice, EA, whomever for that lesson.",2012-10-31,409,long,2012-10,games

Here on Amazon I find myself saying that often, and plan to change that trend.<br /><br />Omnimotion is the product of musician/composer, Stefan Lundaahl, from Sweden. Don't ask me how to enunciate his last name. I don't know, what I do know is this: this guy know's how to make beautiful ambient, dub infused, chill out music better than most.<br /><br />Dream Wide Awake helps you do just that. Day dream. I sit in my office and zone out to music often. Some helps me do that better than others. Put this one in the zone out category.<br />I shall review some of my favorite tracks for you.<br /><br />Track 1 starts us off on our chilled out journey. Nothingness is the title, and nothingness is where it shall take you. Positively speaking though. You do not become a nobody, but rather feel your negative thoughts and feelings slowly... drift... into.... Nothingness. We are started off with a soft synth that becomes accompanied by a slow quiet beat. Unlike most music where the beat is where you start grooving and head bopping, this beat helps you chill out even more. A female vocal enters in. She does not disturb you though. In fact, her soothing voice once again chills you out even more. High pitched flute comes in to sooth away your thoughts and help you triumph over any feelings of pressure and doubt you may have. Can a song comfort you as well as a loved one? I think not, but if I could choose a song to give me an audible hug, it would be this one.<br /><br />Track 2 is our next stop. This song is one of the most beautiful songs ever made. Yes I placed a period after that sentence for a reason. We are welcomed in with a soft beat quickly followed by a female instructing us to \""Look at the sky... Look at the trees... It's so beautiful...\"" I concur. It is. It is so beautiful. There is nothing better than being in the the great out-doors while listening to this song. Living in the PAC NW, I am able to do as instructed in thissong. I look to the mountains, trees, water, and realize... It is, so beautiful. If a song could allow you to slow down and admire the world for its intricate beauties this would also be my top choice. The song keeps taking you away. The female vocalist instructs you to do more looking throughout the rest of the song. All of which are to remind you of the beauties that surround you daily. Finished by a final last breath: \""It's okay to just be.\""<br /><br />We aren't getting much further down the list with my third track. Being just that, the third track. We are offered with a slightly more traditional sound. Still chilled, but with a swifter flow. We are blessed with the docile tones of singer Aleah. She sings us a melody that is smooth and sweet. I haven't grasped the vocals content yet. The song is entitled \""Days of Silence.\"" The songs lyrics seem to once again be making an attempt to sooth over the bad feelings and dilemma's we are presented with on a daily basis in life.<br /><br />Next song that really grabs me is track number 7. This is called Cozy Life, and it may be the most popular Omnimotion song. The song has certain comforts while you listen to it that make it seem familiar yet all new at the same time. I feel like I have always known this song all the while not being able to pin where or when I would have heard it. The female vocals once again do not intrude on this song like so many out there. \""No worries at all\"" is the main line the lyrics send your way throughout the song.<br /><br />\""I'll find a way, yes indeed.<br /> No need to worry at all.<br /> No need to worry at all.<br /> No need to worry at all.\""<br /><br />You heard her! Stop worrying!<br /><br />Although this next track I feel is \""over hyped\"" (I have never heard anyone say anything that would be considered hyping this song, but since they put out an EP of this song I feel they think it is something special) it is none the less very good. Japan is the title of the song, once again not sureas to why. I like the original more than any remix I have heard. It has a nice piano melody with the typical soft synths you are use to now throughout this album. Good song, but not as good as the ones I have already reviewed.<br /><br />Should you buy this album? Yes. There are a couple songs some would consider filler. They are worth your time though and will provide a good listen.

This made for a pretty steep learning curve if you're used to being able to have a bit more control of camera angles. The game is definitely creepy at first, but the thrills wear thin pretty fast. I also thought I would have enjoyed this type of heavily story-driven game much more than I actually did. The cut scenes are tedious, but of course are necessary for the story to continue. I just found them to be way too often and way too drawn out.

But Michel Hazanavicius's modern-day re-creation of a black-and-white silent film is so adroitly executed and artistically wrought that it transcends the gimmick and becomes an impressive work in its own right.<br /><br />Set in the late `20s and early `30s, the period when moviemaking was transitioning from silents to talkies, the movie focuses on George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a dapper matinee-idol who `s more devoted to his dog - the scene-stealing Uggie - than to his acting partner/wife (Penelope Ann Miller).  The problem is that Valentin seems more suited to the silent screen than the sound one - we learn why at the end - so we watch as his career and his personal life take a turn for the worse throughout the course of the story.  If that sounds a bit like the premise of \""Singin' in the Rain,\"" you're right, but the movie also has a touch of \""A Star is Born\"" about it, for as Valentin's career goes into an ever-increasing death-spiral, the beautiful young ingenue (Berenice Bejo) he helped to discover has taken to the talkies like gang-busters and is becoming a major star of the silver screen.  (One can also find a couple of homages to \""Citizen Kane,\"" but they're a little less obvious).<br /><br />\""The Artist\"" is obviously of most interest to those with a love of cinema and movie history, as it re-creates in breathtakingly beautiful terms the look and sound of silent movies (the tinkling-piano score is by Ludovic Bource).  The movie is pure joy to look at, thanks to the eye-popping cinematography of Guillaume Schiffman, which captures the otherworldly elegance of a world framed in black-and-white images. The story may strike some as facile and simplistic to say the least, but that's clearly in keeping with the temper of the times and the era of motion picture history in which it is set.  I could have done with a little more of the behind-the-camera glimpses into old-time moviemaking and a little less of the foreground romance, but that is a minor quibble in a movie that works on so many other levels.  One of those is the acting, with Dujardin and Bejo managing to create effective characters with only a minimum of mugging, and John Goodman and James Cromwell doing the same in supporting roles.  And little Uggie, who also appeared in \""Mr. Fix-it\"" and \""Water for Elephants,\"" puts Toto and Rin Tin Tin to shame in the canine-acting division.<br /><br />With movies like \""Moneyball,\"" \""The Descendents\"" and \""The Tree of Life\"" hanging around, I wouldn't have voted for \""The Artist\"" as the Best Picture of 2011, but I wouldn't have missed the one-of-a-kind visual experience it affords for anything in the world.limpses into old-time moviemaking and a little less of the foreground romance, but that is a minor quibble in a movie that works on so many other levels.

If you've played any other Pandora games or the first Crusader Kings, this is very similar.  The historical research done on these games is extremely accurate and well researched.<br /><br />It is amazing to me how well Pandora captures political interests from different time periods.  Crusader Kings takes place strictly in Europe, so you cannot play any country in the world like some of their other games.  However, there is a multitude of characters you can play, anywhere from a count to a king (or their cultural equivalent).<br /><br />If you've played the first Crusader Kings, there are some good improvements with this version.  First, arranging marriages, which was dreadful in the first game, is still here but they've given you more tools to make decisions.  You can arrange potential mates by skill levels, realms, dynasties, rank, potential alliances, etc.  This means you will probably spend even more time arranging marriages (at least I do) but at least you can understand what your goals are.  I think that, overall, they've increased the difficulty of this game.  Going from being a count to having multiple crowns and half of Europe captured is going to be extremely difficult to achieve.<br /><br />There are several bugs that the old game had that are gone now.  One historical inaccuracy that was in the old game I'm not sure about.  In the old game, the Golden Horde was given a huge unfair advantage that frankly made it difficult to play the game.  I'm not sure if that still exists in this game because I've played all my games so far on the far west side of the map.<br /><br />A hint to those people who have never played a Pandora game.  BEWARE!  This game is going to be extremely complicated, detail oriented, and take a long time to play.  My first Crusader Kings 2 game took me about 28 hours to complete, and I only made it though six generations before my house line died out.  If you've never played a Pandora game before, it will probably take you about 30 hours of playing just to figure out most of the options, and you'll still be missing a few things.

I've put it through my usual \""evaluation\"" process, listening to it through several times in my car and at work. At first I was a little put off that it didn't sound like a traditional Springsteen album (using loops, sampling, and a tiny bit of rap), but all but two of the songs have grown on me. I don't understand reviewers who listen to an album a couple of times and write quick reviews. Music to me takes time to analyze and judge.<br /><br />Much of the criticism I have read about \""Wrecking Ball\"" centers on the fact that Bruce cannot possibly understand the plight of the working man because he is a wealthy rock star. I think that is rubbish. Bruce has always excelled at telling stories, and they are not all autobiographical. Another criticism is that this album doesn't sound like some of his iconic '70's and '80's albums. I'm glad it doesn't. We'll always have those earlier albums. I want something new and topical. \""Wrecking Ball\"" fits that bill. All of the songs, with the exception of \""You've Got It\"" touch on the hard times many of us currently find ourselves in. The album does progress to hope through faith and endurance. The lyrics of \""We Take Care of Own\"", \""Death to My Hometown\"", and \""Shackled and Drawn\"" all make reference to the failures and crimes of our politicians and the financial industry. Every time Bruce speaks these truths, he risks his record sales and concert revenue with the many who disagree with him. That takes courage. Taking risks with your music tasks courage as well, as it leads to the criticism that you aren't the artist you used to be. The upbeat music of \""Easy Money\"" belies its dark subject matter. The guitar solo and keyboards on \""This Depression\"" lift the singer's grief to his lover (and maybe to his God). I love the gospel feel of \""Rocky Ground\"" and can even tolerate the bit of rapping in the middle section. And the symbolism of the title track works for me. Is Bruce talking about a football stadium or our brief existence on earth, or both? Listen carefully.<br /><br />My minor criticisms of \""Wrecking Ball\"" are with the plodding and overly long \""Jack of All Trades\"" (the producer should have faded this song more aggressively, as he did on \""We Take Care . . \"" and \""You've Got It\"") and the parade of cliches lifted from better songs on \""Land of Hope and Dreams\"". I miss the contributions of Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici, but this isn't an E Street album anyway.<br /><br />I recommend this album. It is better than the previous two, and probably is Springsteen's best since \""The Rising\"". I think it will be a touchtone to 2012 much as \""Born in the USA\"" was to 1984 or \""Born To Run\"" was to 1975. Bruce is not the same person he was on either of those two albums.

Unfortunately for him, the rebel Kamari have been tipped off by hacker/journalist Riser Trent. Equipped with a powerful new tool, a swarm of networked drones, the Information Cloud of the title, he televises the assault for everyone to see. Accompanying Chambers in the assault is his old girlfriend - and mother of his child - Rachel Henson. And, for reasons official and unofficial, Admiral Gail Thompson of the Security Forces is willing to take extreme measures to shut Trent's broadcast down.<br /><br />The good news is that West's plot twists and pacing reminded me favorably of S. A. Swann, and the battle scenes, while not as strong as Peter F. Hamilton's, reminded me of that writer.<br /><br />And West's knowledge of cybernetics and artificial intelligence contributes to some interesting inventions. Specifically, he addresses the issue of how the sensory feed from hundreds of networked droids could be usefully fed into the human mind, and one of his weapons has an interesting and plausible Achilles heel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what is missing is the context for this story's main struggle between the Kamari and the Security Forces. We are not given any idea of the issues at disputes or even, really, what type of government Cinnamon City has. Granted, West gives us some knowledge in a glossary and cast listing at the end of the story, but that's not the place to do it in the first installment of a series. The fate of a couple of characters is left hanging at the end of the story which contributes to the feeling that this is not a story but the middle of a novel. And West's attempts to depict the emotional life of Rachel and Nick are clichéd.<br /><br />So, in short, while West has promise, I will not be reading more CinnamonCity stories.<br /><br />[Review copy supplied by author.]",2012-11-19,349,long,2012-11,ebooks

Its based the characters off the Generation One cartoon series and even brought back some of the original voice actors. Fall of Cybertron continues in this fashion, but brings out some of the lesser known Transformers and puts them in the campaign. The game is overall the same as the last one, but with more polish and fine tuning.<br /><br />The story is decent and entertaining, but nothing memorable. It picks up from the last game where Megatron is still trying to wipe out the Autobots, but this time prevent them from escaping on the Ark. Optimus Prime and his gang are desperately trying to gather enough Energon to power the Ark, but Megatron and the Decepticons, as well as the Insecticons are causing problems for everyone. The planet is pretty much lost at this point and all Optimus cares about is getting his Autobots off the damn planet and to safety. You play through thirteen chapters of various different Transformers from both sides to experience this pretty cinematic and entertaining story.<br /><br />You play as regular Transformers and the larger ones. Bumblebee is your first one during the first chapter. Optimus Prime and Megatron are used quite a bit, but also Cliff Jumper, Bruticus, Jazz, Vortex, Grimlock, Starscream, and even for a brief moment in the final chapter, Jetfire. I preferred this over choosing between just a few different ones like in the last game. It made the campaign more unique, and less repetitive and boring. Each chapter is completely different with different gameplay elements thanks to each Transformer being unique. Sneaking around cloaked as Cliff Jumper, grappling as Jazz, flying around as Vortex, and stomping things into the ground as Bruticus was awesome. The vehicle forms are better controlled and I used them a lot more than I did in the last game. Even the gun play is tighter.<br /><br />The enemies are smarter this time around, and there's a bit more of a variety. The Insecticons add to this variety and are spread throughout the campaign. Even the objectives are more varied instead of just pulling levers all the time. There's a new upgrade system via the Teletraan 1 which allows you to use Energon Shards to upgrade weapons. These upgrades are actually useful and make a huge difference. I still wish I can upgrade my vehicle form, but they are already powerful enough. The campaign just stands as a solid cinematic Transformers story and is just so much better than the last game. There are still a few issues like difficulty spikes, minor collision detection issues, but it isn't nearly as abundant as the last game. This game is hard, and if you don't take cover and watch out you will die in a few hits. Using shields and Energon packs helps, but at least you won't die every 5 seconds like the last game.<br /><br />The graphics are really good, but it still uses the Unreal Engine 3 based on the consoles and it could look better. I was hoping the PC version would have some enhanced visuals, but we it doesn't. There are some ugly muddy textures here and there, but overall it looks way better than the last game. War for Cybertron already looked dated when it came out. The art style is gorgeous and the voice acting is just top-notch. The multiplayer comes back again, but not much else has changed besides being able to build your own robot. After a while you will get bored like the last game, but hardcore fans may stay. If it makes you feel better you get to be a T-Rex as Grimlock later in the game. I just can't tell you how many surprises this game can throw at you. There ia just a ton of love put into this game and tidbits for fans.<br /><br />As it stands, Fall of Cybertron improves immensely over the last game, but still doesn't offer enough variation and diversity to make this game of the year worthy.

The only connection I can find is that they are both top 40 rock and roll bands but beyond this? I don't care what the critics and self appointed experts say. This is not a generation defining album, it is not the answer to any question. It's a good album but it widely misses what The Beach Boys were about. That it represents 'growth' on some level--OK, fine, but surfers and car junkies never actually grew up, guys who thought cuddling with a hot girl on the beach in the glow of a driftwood fire--we never grew up, either. Nobody actually wanted The Beach Boys to grow up. They had an astonishing run of hits in an era when you were only as good as your last #1 hit--and The Beach Boys had a few--OK--a lot. For good reason. In their prime, they did it right. I'm not going to get specific and document every word I say, because back then, it was all about airplay. Brian Wilson went toe to toe with the British invasion, he kicked Motown to the curb because--and most of you miss this simple point--radio, top 40 AM radio was all our radios got in those days. At home it was 45s, albums...in the car, it was Howlin' Wolf, Kenny Griffin, it was even 'El Grande' out on Long Island, NY, if that was all you could get. Hell, I think Don Imus spent some time slingin' singles at some dirkwater AM station. In the 60's from one end to the other millions of us tuned into AM radio to hear the next 'hot' song. The Beatles transitioned from AM to FM almost effortessly. While 'Paperback Writer' was tearing up the charts on AM, 'Norweigan Wood' was getting airplay on the college stations. The Beach Boys never made that jump. This effort was their trial balloon. It sunk like a rock--if that was the point.<br /><br />This is a good album. It's a very good Beach Boys album. But a classic? I think it was a mistimed ATTEMPT at a classic. You have to put yourself back in the time it was released. Then you get an idea of the disconnect between the critics and the listeners. The critics wanted the Beach Boys to grow up. The listeners and album buyers did not. First, it was MONO. We were getting access to STEREO. The Beatles recorded in STEREO. Not MONO.

Turns our you really get what you pay for. It was my first (and last) game download purchase from Amazon. They had a chance to pull me away from Steam and failed. Your experience may vary as one can see from reading all the reviews on this game (for some people it works flawlessly, others encounter issues too numerous to list). I hope Amazon will not edit my review and at least 1 or 2 poor souls looking to get the game they paid good money for to work can make use of my experience described below.  The game file is big and aware of that, I downloaded it from work. Download speed there is faster and instead of taking days (meaning pauses to download etc...) I could get it done in a couple of hours while leaving the PC (docked and wired connection) behind for meetings. So I did try to take precautions given the numerous reviews mentioning file corruption.  Back at home I try to install the game and it fails with the least informative error message ever \""DA:O failed to install\"" and some generic \""Why don't you try again?\"" kind of suggestion for a fix. So I make sure I go to task manager and kill every possible task I can and try again, this time keeping an eye on the boring install window to try to catch the issue. At around 70% of the install it hangs up and I was quick enough to capture a screenshot. So I found my corrupt file. In my case it was \""addinsdao_prc_ep_1coreenvvgk200dvgk200d_1216.gpu.rim\"", yours may be different. Shortly after the hang up the failed install message showed again.  Wondering if anything went wrong with the download I decide to try again. Deleted all files from the PC and downloaded even a fresh Amazon installer, 2 days later I have a new file to try again. Did not work. The install failed again and *on the exact same file*. This is important because I would think a file corruption from the download process would be random. The fact itfailed at the exact same file makes me wonder if Amazon is not just selling a corrupted game.  I then proceeded to try fix it myself, since I read enough about the lack of helpfulness from EA and Bioware in technical issues from both Amazon and other forums. And I wanted to avoid getting on EA's bad side since there are instances where even bans from forums locked people out of their games.  Forums did not help much. A lot of people mentioned \""fixing the corrupted files with good ones\"" and I kept wondering \""Where did they get these so called good files\""? Others suggested using Origin. I refuse to install it on my PC on principle (you could say I'm a Steam fanboi) so not an option (I must point out I would have broken down and installed it if I had not been able to fix it any other way).  How I actually fixed my issue: using Google and WinRAR (which has just converted a free trial into a purchase). I googled the file name of my corrupted file. Needless to say, the results are less than savory sites. I was not worried about breaking any law since I legitimately purchased the game, but virus/spyware are always an issue. Given I have firewall, anti-spyware and anti-virus installed I took the jump. And in the process I found out that I did not only have a corrupt file. There were at least 3 dozen files missing from my install folder (the unsavory site I used placed the files neatly into the correct paths so it was easy to see things were missing). I had to download these missing files one by one and make sure I got the folder path correct for each fie. I then used WinRAR to patch the downloaded files into the main corrupted RAR file (if you are wondering about free alternatives, 7-Zip at least will NOT work, I tried). I scanned all files for virus before doing the patch, for precaution.  Crossing my fingers I tried the install again and it worked! So now I'm able to play the game and hopefully it is good and makes me not regret going through so much trouble to get it working. By the way, EA's activation methods for both the game and the DLC are a pain in the backside. Not streamlined at all. I don't mind DRM, but if you want to do it, make it easier on the people who paid for your product.  A few last comments, mostly to Amazon:  1. You have the money to develop a download manager that checks for file integrity before jumping into the installation and can try to patch any issues if there is a problem. So do it! Games are only getting bigger and file corruption issues can only get worse.  2. Do check the file you are selling. Maybe it was EA/Bioware that gave you a junk file to upload, but either way, you are the one selling it so make sure it's in good condition.",2012-01-07,878,extra_long,2012-01,games

Only one who had been holed up in a Tibetan monastery since the Nineteen Eighties wouldn't know, in grim detail, of the travails of the New Zealand All Blacks. The All Blacks are, bar none, the most successful major sporting franchise on the planet, but they have a habit of world-conquering at all material times except the only material time: the four yearly World Cup. At that point, as my English friends delight in reminding me, the All Blacks habitually, inexplicably, choke.<br /><br />For that monastic sort of kiwi Gregor Paul's new e-book might be of interest (at any rate for those resident at monasteries possessed of e-readers and wifi).<br /><br />And there's the rub: it is difficult to know to whom else this fiercely hagiographic e-book will appeal.<br /><br />Gregor Paul is New Zealand resident, but hails from Scotland. He's been the chief rugby correspondent for a New Zealand Sunday paper for eight years, and on the breadth of that experience he has founded this book.<br /><br />In its analytical depth Redemption bears the hallmarks of that newspaper journalism heritage, in that coverage is wide and shallow rather than narrow and deep: nothing wrong with that unless your target market happens to harbour a national obsession with your subject, in which case there is little on that method they won't already know. This might not have mattered, either, were a big, glossy book festooned with photos of the heroic journey, suitable for father's day. But it is an e-book: it has little value as a souvenir; it can't sit on a coffee table, and it hasn't got any pictures.<br /><br />Paul does pitch a deeper story, which is why I bought it: The secret of how coach Graham Henry turned \""twenty four years of hurt\"" into final victory. This sounded like it might offer something along the lines of Michael Lewis' vastly superior baseball memoir, Moneyball. There is certainly scope for it: as Lewis demonstrates, the potential benefits of technology and statistical analytics in sport are huge, and since Clive Woodward's extraordinary achievements with a fairly ordinary England squad at the 2003 Rugby World Cup (at which New Zealand once again choked), the potential of such techniques in rugby has been plain to see.<br /><br />But of this there is little. Part of the problem is that, even in 2011, the All Blacks very nearly choked: the last 60 minutes of the world cup final felt a great deal like another disastrous melt-down, and when it finally came, victory over a French team, whom the All Blacks had thumped once in the tournament already, was by only a point. Had the ball bounced differently - indeed, had the French fly-half not badly shanked a penalty kick with 15 minutes remaining, Graham Henry's revolution would have come to naught.<br /><br />You could forgive that, too, for a father's day potboiler, had Paul much talent as a writer. The British Isles may have disappointing rugby teams, but it is blessed with absurdly literate rugby journalists: correspondents like the Sunday Times' Stephen Jones write especially well even if New Zealanders feel deeply that they don't know what they're talking about. (Jones is a particular bete noire in New Zealand, something he takes great pride in).<br /><br />Alas, Gregor Paul is no Stephen Jones. His style is a dead-eye pastiche of the \""Kiwi Vernacular\"", a local dialect in which entire paragraphs are assembled from clich&eacute;s, platitudes, truisms and mixed metaphors. Now if you're not bothered about picturesque writing - in fairness, not all rugby-mad Kiwis are - this will seem a petty quibble. But it drove me up the wall.<br /><br />I suspect Paul dictated, rather than typed, his manuscript. This style would sound less offensive in conversation than itlooks in print. Of McCaw he says: \""He was in for the long haul and his country needed him, really needed him to be captain fantastic\"". Elsewhere he writes, \""from having been on the edge of the abyss, staring into the dark yonder and relentless emptiness, the All Blacks set off for a six game tour of Asia and the UK in late October with a chance to make history.\""<br /><br />Nor is Paul an assertive writer: he liberally uses qualifiers like \""potentially\"" and \""possibly\"" and often writes in the passive voice, occasionally allowing meaning to leach away altogether: \""it was a squad that engendered a level of optimism\"".<br /><br />These examples are respresentative of the entire text. This is dreadful, dreadful writing.<br /><br />E-books are easily, and cheaply published: if you have text, you have an e-book. But this is no excuse not to expend effort on the text. This book is under-edited and feels particularly rushed.<br /><br />There is the kernel of a decent book in here, but it needs far more work: more effort to present the personalities (there are five main, very different, characters), the technical details of the All Blacks' strategy, some photos (this would work much better as a physical book where design, layout and images help to tell the story), and crucially, far more time working to make the text presentable.<br /><br />Olly Buxtoned him to be captain fantastic\"".

The sound was appalling -- it was often difficult to understand what actors were saying. Part of the blame may lie with the actors themselves as most of them adopted the modern actor's naturalistic fallacy, believing it is OK to mumble and forgetting that a major part of their role is to communicate with an audience.<br /><br />Christian Bales lacks lustre and charisma in this role. I thought he did well with Batman Begins but it's all downhill from there. Michael Caine seems to have one gear as Alfred -- contrived weepiness and an attachment to Bruce Wayne that is unbelievable given the lack of any real relationship between the actors on screen. Bane was passable and Anne Hathaway does a great job.<br /><br />The real problem with this film for me was that it is basically an ensemble piece. There are simply too many points of view and to many bland characters I couldn't care less about. The audience is never afforded the opportunity to identify with a point of view character because the net is cast too wide. If we are to identify at all it is with the people of Gotham, looking on as observers of a Batman who is noticeable by his absence a lot of the time.<br /><br />The fight scenes seemed lame, partly due to the naturalised sound effects, I imagine. The CGI looks like it was done an an iPhone app and the editing lacked continuity, presenting us with a sequence of disjointed scenes that left me wondering what on earth was going on, who I was following, and why I was even bothering to watch the rest of the film.<br /><br />The concept of the Dark Knight is great but the execution in this film was poor. The writer/director seems to have no grasp of basic story-telling dynamics or the importance of engaging an audience.

I thought X-Men series had no action at all and should not even been called X-Men series. It was more of them just standing/sitting around and talking about their enemies and who is behind all of this events happening. If they weren't doing that than they would be standing/sitting around and playing mind games with each other. The \""actually fighting\"" would last about 30 seconds or so for each show. Not an action pack series at all. Iron Man was much better than X-Men, but not as good as Blade.<br /><br />What makes Blade better than the other two series? It has the right storyline, action, and characters mix all in one. In every show, you will get to see Blade \""actually fighting\"" and he is kicking butt at it. He also knows how to fight and talk at the same time. Amazing!<br /><br />The series has rememberable characters and are used well to make a great story. They really try to build up every main character and talked the why they are fighting the vampires. Each one has their own story to tell and each one has a different reason for fighting. Even the main villain story gets told in full to why he is the main villain. I started to really care for each character more and more as I learned more about them more.<br /><br />I love how in this show has Blade doing special deadly sword techniques. He would kill harder and tougher enemies with his special sword techniques. Also, they slowly introduce each sword technique he knows how to do. This was done very well in the series as they didn't rush it all in. I started to think how many does he know? How many are there? Blade starts doing harder more advantage sword technique as his enemies get harder to kill.

Nathan Pierce, Macayle, members of Absolute's Rebellion, and Pearl, Nathan's girlfriend, know this for a fact. They've been hanging low in the previously deserted Westgate Mall Plaza for a little over a week. Though they've taken many measures to protect themselves from the demons, the president, and everyone else out to murder them - and there are many groups who would do anything to see Nathan and Pearl dead - that doesn't mean they can expect to safely live in the Mall for long.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when danger finally does come, it comes in doubles.<br /><br />When a mysterious man tells Nathan that there are people in a town 15 miles away who know where Daisy, his sister, will be executed, Nathan is instantly determined to go to that town. However, just as Nathan is starting to create a plan, he learns that the strange sounds many people in the mall have complained about are coming from the Legion (demonic aliens) vessel that landed oddly in the Best Buy next to where everyone is staying. Unlike other vessels, its landing didn't create a massive crater or wipe out square blocks. The tip is protruding from the ground, the rest hidden underneath.<br /><br />The first time Nathan looked at it alone, nothing happened. It's not until he, Macayle, and Pearl venture to the mysterious vessel together that all hell breaks loose. It turns out Pearl is a key for the special vessels that haven't instantly erupted. The moment she gets near them, the vessel opens and allows new, creepier aliens entry into the world. First emerges a female with black rock material coating her body. She's wearing an elaborate mask, the mask that is gracing the cover of Dark Masquerade, and she's able to cause destruction just by speaking. Unfortunately, there are many more masked females. To make matters worse, as though things weren't bad enough, an alien larger than the Best Buy also emerges.<br /><br />Nathan, Macalay, and Pearl go back to the Westgate Mall Plaza in the hopes that they can at least help some of the people there, but most of the occupants were already murdered - not by the hands of an alien, but by the hands of a trigger happy, delirous man with a gun.<br /><br />At this point, the three of them can do nothing but search for the town where people who know about Daisy are supposedly staying.<br /><br />Just like in the previous two books, there is much more to the adventure than what Nathan is going through, though much of his tribulations effect and are tied to the other conflicts. We also get to see the story from the point of views of Heather, Sin, President Amanda Stone, Daisy, Mr. Silver, Ericka Shane, and Jasper.<br /><br />President Amanda Stone is hiding in an underground bunker. With members of Absolute and Daisy's Defiance determined to see her dead, that's her best plan of action. She's the only leader with power still on her mind. While others are shaken up by Legion's attacks, she's deadset on conquering and rising beyond the title of President of the United States. She has the dark advisor, the Man of Shadows, on her side promising her power. She needs him for more than that, though. His touch heals her. He is her drug.<br /><br />And what happens if you keep turning to a powerful drug? After a while, you lose yourself to it.<br /><br />Sin, meanwhile, is staying in the Village Grove Apartments complex. Sin has the barcode enforced by President Amanda Stone and the Falling Star Directives - laws that ban all religious items, force people to taint their bodies with the barcodes as a means of currency, and sentence opposers to death - but she can't stay in the Sanctuary where all of the government's followers live. A lot of her actions in the previous book have put her on the President's hit list.<br /><br />With a baby in her womb, the assassin that killed her mother after her life, and a mysterious, powerful man named Ryn deadset on making her his princess/slave, she has plenty of things to worry about. Sex is her greatest weapon and also her greatest weakness. No one knows this better than Ryn, and he will use that against her to make her his.<br /><br />Halfway across the world, Heather and Griffin, two Wedges, are out to find the blade capable of killing immortals. Without the blade, Earth and other worlds will most definitely be destroyed. Griffin just learned that he is Wedge royalty and has rare, serendipitous powers. Joseph Warren is the Vector agent in charge of their mission. In fact, they are all aboard a Vector ship, their destination the Land of Seven Moons in the Bermuda Triangle.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the land's monks and leader have no intention of giving them the blade. They're not open to getting involved in any way, and they're willing to take violent measures to make that clear.<br /><br />Like the monks, Mr. Silver also doesn't care about the pain and suffering everyone is going through. Sure, a quarter of his ships have already left earth and taken people to Anaisha, an untarnished planet where everyone's memories of earth will be erased, but he isn't doing it out of kindness. After all, Mr. Silver is an egomaniac who sees Anaisha as his opportunity to become the god of a new world.<br /><br />As much as Mr. Silver wishes to go to Anaisha, he know he still has too much work to do at SilverTech Industries to leave just yet. Beside worrying about the messes his losses from previous books may bring him - Hush, the woman he made his slave, his daughter, the time traveling device, and all of the research connected to the device - he also has to handle Tamasine and the assassin Tamasine sent as revenge for when Mr. Silver killed Inken, Tamasine's sister.<br /><br />Mr. Silver really isn't that concerned, though. Power is his only concern. Just a little more time, a little more research, and his scientists will discover how to go about becoming immortal. Than he really can rule Anaisha as a god.<br /><br />As expected from a book in the Black Earth series, there is a lot going on. However, there aren't as many events as the previous books, and it's easier to grasp all the different storylines and how they intermingle. Two things came to mind the instant I started Dark Masquerade:<br /><br />First, the story is very well-written. Everything flows well. I never once found myself unable to read a section due to bad writing.<br /><br />Second, this would make an awesome comic book series. Seriously. If someone made this into a comic, I would be very excited. I'm smelling a great Indiegogo campaign.<br /><br />Those two things stuck in my mind throughout the book.<br /><br />What I liked most about this book, as well as David's other books, is how all the characters and organizations have shades of grey. No one is completely good or bad, black and white, and the uncertainty makes for an intriguing read. If you, like me, love learning about other creatures, worlds, powers, and items, this book will definitely pull you in.<br /><br />Once again, David doesn't disappoint. I've loved every one of the books in the Black Earth series, in spite of the sometimes overwhelming amount of stuff to keep up with.

And it seems that the general consensus amongst true metal enthusiasts is that the band represented a solid rock foundation for future, more elaborate and sophisticated bands in the hard rock/metal arena. And it seems that most Saxon listeners point to Power and the Glory as the band's best, most compelling release.<br /><br />With sounds similar to AC/DC, Krokus, Iron Maiden and Fastway, Power and the Glory is an interesting collection of riffs and lyrics that takes the listener between two distinct worlds: hard rock recklessness and metal fantasy. There is little tying these two basic themes together -- but the overall energy and thoughtfulness behind the music makes the lack of continuity of the album a small sacrifice. These songs are memorable for their incessant riffs and hooks and the sense that the band is trying to reach the listeners' sense of imagination.<br /><br />Of course, at first listen, some of album's themes and hooks seem somewhat amateurish and adolescent, but this is the magic of the album for many. Many of the listeners upon first listening to Power and the Glory were just that: amateurish and adolescent -- and we didn't care either!! And thus we get to the core reason behind many a metal head's appreciation of this album: it is a time capsule that represents a time when metal was yet to be fully explored; when less-well-crafted, not over-produced, and a \""rock if you are commercial or not\"" mentality was the draw that sold millions on the metal lifestyle. Metal was for everyone who had a mind to let loose their inhibitions, release some tension, and stick their fingers in the face of oppressors, authorities, and the status quo. The Power and the Glory is a rocking representation of these things -- exactly.<br /><br />So, to all you wielders of casual 1 and 2 star blastings -- take a seat my little pop devotees. This is metal my friends -- the good, the bad, and the ugly. And Saxon's Power and the Glory, with all its imperfection and lack of multi-million dollar production polish, is exactly what sounds like: a British metal band finding itself amidst a rapidly growing metal movement. And most metal fans will agree -- Saxon did a mighty fine job with this album.<br /><br />My favorite tracks: (1)Power and the Glory, (3)Warrior, (4)Nightamre, (6)Watching the Sky, (8)The Eagle Has Landed.<br /><br />Final Opinion: Power and the Glory is a solid addition to any metal enthusiasts CD vault..

This download is #5 of thirty live concerts to commemorate the first season, 2009-10, of then new music director Alan Gilbert. I have no idea how successful the series has been commercially, or the similar one from the Philadelphia Orch. - Amazon carries both. American orchestras have priced themselves out of making more than a handful of recordings, and it would be a boon if the Web turned into a saving grace.<br /><br />Here from Oct. 16-17, 2009 is a Beethoven concert delivered in the Hanoi Opera House on the orchestra's historic tour to Vietnam (goodwill gestures are admirable, but the horrible memories of that ill-fated country are still too painful for many of my generation). We get the Egmont Over. and the Seventh Sym., but frankly, I didn't hold out much hope that Gilbert would deliver memorable readings. The popular standing of Beethoven is as high as ever with audiences, but modern conductors seem to find little to say in his music, and most are diverted by the puny Beethoven favored by period performance practices. As expected, the Egmont proceeds with efficiency and very little spirit, although Gilbert does handle it with respect, a full orchestra, and traditional vibrato in the strings. He doesn't stamp the music with his personality or with much adventure, however.<br /><br />The well-handled but ordinary Seventh that follows raises questions of \""Why bother?\"" But both readings would be welcome at a subscription concert that passes the time on a Friday afternoon. I don't want to diminish the excellence of the playing - one never forgets that the Philharmonic is an orchestra of star soloists. All tempos are traditional, but overall this is like Barenboim lite. At least the finale works itself up to a little extra energy, although the entire program leaves me wondering why Beethoven isn't the volatile force of nature that he used to be.

The first example was early in the book, when Joey Czerinski, the protagonist, is gambling, and falls for several fallacies that have plagued gamblers since time began. The laws of probability and statistics are the same, and gamblers still don't understand them. However, the largest thing I saw was the illogic and ridiculousness of war.<br /><br />The description of \""Feeling Lucky\"" references Joseph Heller's classic book, \""Catch 22.\"" I'm hesitant to take this comparison too far, because, for me, \""Feeling Lucky\"" lacks the immediacy of Heller's book. The distance provided by the setting in the future blunts the terror. (I find it harder to feel the same about a killing in the distant future. They don't seem as real as it would if in contemporary times.) However, the satirical humor that springs from shining a light on the idiocy of war, politics, and the politics of war comes through, and the laughter comes much easier.<br /><br />**Originally written for \""Books and Pals\"" book blog.

Adobe Lightroom has some features that are appealing to me, including lens correction, better publishing/export & significantly better noise reduction sliders. I felt at the time it was the best option moving forward.<br /><br />So I purchased Lightroom for Mac and dedicated the whole weekend to learning the software. The first issue (which I knew going into it) was getting all my Aperture photos into Lightroom. Files edited in Aperture cannot be imported into Lightroom w/ corrections (unless exported as jpegs). This is not a knock on LR as much as it is a simple incompatibility with the software. I overcame this and moved on.<br /><br />Immediately I noticed the organization and overall flow of LR was significantly different than Aperture. Simple things like drag and drop to the desktop were not there. Smart folders (or smart collections) were extremely limited. The library view was very clunky and space was wasted w/ oversized photo icons. Jumping in and out of these modules just seemed unnatural. I am sure with time many of these things would become second nature, but overall the library organization was just unbelievably bad.<br /><br />The Develop module has Aperture beat on many items, and with powerful photoshop features built in how could it not? But then simple things like previewing different B&W settings before you apply were not there (as they are in Aperture). A simple but very effective first line edit - pro auto enhance in Aperture, does not exist in LR. Aperture also beats LR in brushes. Editing photos just seemed so much easier in Aperture.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I am having buyer's remorse over purchasing LR. It certainly has potential to be great, but digital post processing shouldn't be this convoluted. Although Lightroom has more features in terms of customization and developing and appears faster than Aperture, it is sandbagged with a strange and unnatural workflow.",2012-09-24,344,long,2012-09,software

It involves a great deal of emotional intimacy as well - being involved in each others' lives, putting their needs first, showing respect, nurturing each other, and much more. Kyle Bennett and Evan Walker of Sloan Parker's book 'Take Me Home' have this kind of intimate relationship except they are best friends, not lovers. Since they first met, they have been closer to each other than anyone else and everyone around them sees it. They are soul mates; Kyle and Evan belong together, but have emotional obstacles to overcome which they feel are to risky to even discuss, so they remain in limbo, loving each other, but being afraid to take the next step for fear of losing each other altogether.  Kyle feels unworthy of Evan. Kyle knows he has intimacy issues and constantly reminds himself: \""Don't you dare hurt him!\"" Kyle is the one who has to admit the truth, that he does love Evan and wants to be with him, and only him, and Evan is the one he has to convince, which in the end, he does quite brilliantly.  Even though Evan adores Kyle, he realizes that Kyle can't give him the commitment he needs to be happy. And he's wise to guard his heart, but it's hard to do when his heart already belongs to Kyle; but when Evan does finally give in and admit his feelings, he's surprisingly assertive about it which is delightful.  'Take Me Home' is a powerful love story entwined with mystery, intrigue, and danger. It was maddening, at times, to watch Kyle and Evan struggling with the inevitable, but it was also quite poignant and I became emotionally vested in the experience because of their devotion. The information about the inner workings of the rail industry was enlightening and, of course, provided a very romantic aura. Although there were several intricate subplots which, at times, were a little hard to follow, Sloan brought all of them together quite satisfactorily at the end. It was exciting, frightening, emotional, frustrating, and satisfying. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a passionate, well written love story filled with adventure and angst.

I've been using Quicken since 1999; so I'm familiar with the Quicken \""paradigm\"" as well.<br /><br />I upgraded my Quicken 2009 to 2012 a couple nights ago.  Here we go.<br /><br />PROBLEM 1) Quicken 2012 wouldn't read my original 2009 files.  I followed some instructions in the Quicken 2012 FAQ to rename and move the files, but it didn't help.  I started a chat session with the Quicken support team and they had me attempt to open one of my back up files.  That one opened.  The technician offered no explanations as to why my original files hadn't opened.<br /><br />THE FIX:  The technician said I should not have followed the FAQ but didn't say why and didn't indicate he would be doing anything about the poor FAQ.  Once the backup file opened, it took about 30 minutes for the program to convert my old data to the new 2012 single file format.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:  After this painful process that I had no idea would take so long I decided I'd better spend the money to buy a book because I'm worried that this version of Quicken is not engineered any better than the last many.  Unfortunately, the only book is also by Quicken.  More money for them so I guess you'd say they have an effective business model, but if someone can point me to some finance software that will download my data from financial institutions and allow me to categorize my expenses, I'm gone.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />PROBLEM 2) I successfully downloaded financial data without any problems but tonight I attempted to pay some bills.

The payment fields will all become blank.<br />4) Enter a differentpayee than the one you entered last time, and hit tab.<br />5) As if by magic, your typing is thrown out and the payee you entered in step 1 now appears in the Payee field instead of the one you typed in step 4.<br />6) Continue the experiment, try entering the new payee by typing, by selecting an item from the list that appears below the payee as you type, and from the Payee List. Sometimes none of them will work and sometimes choosing from the Payee list will work. And yes, if you fail to notice that quicken has magically reverted to the payee from #1, you will end up sending money to the payee from step(1) instead of the payee from step (4). If using the Payee List doesn't work, notice that the payment tab fields all goes blank except for<br />a garbage date.<br />7) To get the problem to stop, exit the Online Center and reopen it.<br /><br />I'm working with Quicken support to troubleshoot the problem.",2012-04-13,513,extra_long,2012-04,software

When Money discontinued, I went back to Quicken and even upgraded to 2009, but had difficulty in setting up budgets, along with other things. However, I did manage to setup the mortgage, credit cards, other debts and continued using it through 2010 when I bought my Mustang. Afterwards, I stopped using it and switched to Android and then attempted to keep up with my finances on the Ipad. I had already been keeping up with the finances on a spreadsheet and somehow wanted the look of the spreadsheet to be in a fiance software.<br /><br />Quicken 2013 came out and with that, the promise of a mobile version. I immediately bought the 2013 version and was willing to enter a whole year and a half of data when I thought better of it and just told Quicken to Skip payments. I was relieved when it suggested that the principal of each account would automatically be updated, and did so correctly! Now, i do not have to enter a year's worth of data.<br /><br />I tried setting up the mobile and to this day, still have issues with the balance and updating. There is a lot that needs to be done with the mobile version, but like everything else, once more people use it and the demand rises, I am sure Intuit will make the needed improvements to make it workable. I have not called them for technical support on the mobile issue, but will once I go through the software one more time.<br /><br />I tried budgets again and was not really happy with it. However, I did like the spreadsheet view. After struggling and giving up with the budgets, I did go through all of my accounts, cleaned them up and closed out the accounts I no longer have and the loans that were already paid off. Next, I updated the Bills Reminders and after working with Bill Reminders, I saw how I could use this as a budget tool instead of the actual budget! The only thing that Bill Reminder doesn't have reminders for is... EXPENSES. I think this would be really sweet. It keeps expenses separate, though, but only after an expense has been made. SO, what I did is rethought how I do my finances and came up with a simple solution...<br /><br />Instead of trying to budget $120 a month for gas and $200 a month for groceries... I setup Bill Reminders for Gas at $25 per week and groceries at $50 per week.  This means that instead of filling up every 3 weeks or so, I fill up every week. This will give me a good idea of what I really spend on gas each week. The cool thing is, when i enter the grocery expense or the gas expense, I skip the Bill entry for that week and just enter directly into my checking account the entries. This way, it shows up as an expense.<br /><br />Since I got the software, I have improved my finances ten-fold and now making wiser decisions on where my money should go. I am using the savings goal part of the software to help set aside money for projects. I am better organized with fiances and will continue to stay on top of things. I am more energized to pay off debt rather than incur new debt. The program runs solid and as long as you continue to make backups and store the backups in two or three different places, if you ever have an issue with the software or other problems, you can always restore the backup or do repairs to the database. Intuit folks are quite capable and able to help. Despite running solid, there are bugs in this software but nothing that would prevent you from using the software on a consistent basis. If you have issues and problems, verbalize them to Intuit so they can work out the problems. The 2013 version has paid for itself the first week I got it and I am looking forward to next year's in hopes that they will have adapted to windows tablet style of input.<br /><br />For me, I use my Apple Ipad to remote into my windows 8 desktop and working with Quicken in this manner is not the easiest!

I was turned off by the Conan the Barbarian outfits and the seemingly cheesy CGI work that I saw in the trailers.  However, after watching the film on Amazon Instant Video (admittedly, I still went the cheap, non-HD route), I walked away quite impressed with the movie.<br /><br />In short, as many reviews have noted, many of the themes in JC are familiar.  In fact, folks like George Lucas clearly lifted many of their themes and action pieces from John Carter, if the movie is in fact representative of the book. (Which I intend to read at some point on my Kindle.) Unlike George's underwhelming prequels, though, the film had very entertaining characters, an extremely strong and well-motivated female lead, and even children's elements (the dog-alien) that didn't insult the viewer with lowbrow humor.  In short, this is the movie that The Phantom Menace should have been.  In a fair world, JC would have made the $700M that TPM did, while TMP languished.  Sadly, that was not to be.<br /><br />In the end, I have the feeling I'll pick up the Blu-ray in the near future.  It's a film with great action, pretty doggone good CG effects (the Tharks and the dog-alien are very enjoyable, even if they're not 100% believable), and an excellent score.  I dropped the film by one star mainly because I felt that Taylor Kitsch lacks the charisma to be a leading actor and he pulls the movie down when it should have soared.

A music one, that is.<br /><br />I will readily admit to liking half of the last Kelly Clarkson disk, so I bought 'Stronger' pretty much sound unheard. It's not an out of the park winner, but it is not a dud either. Sometimes mediocrity is worse than being bad. Mediocre can be just forgettable, which is not a good thing.<br /><br />Clarkson is a decent vocalist and seems like an ok individual, but some of the writing and production just seems to replicate things she's already done and accomplished  - more of the same to build upon what has made her famous. But usually that practice collapses upon itself when people think you're one-note.<br /><br />This, of course, is usually the way of the record label and / or management trying to preserve their almighty bottom line.<br /><br />From a technical perspective, Clarkson seemingly has the ability to sing most styles of music and succeed, if the song was good.

I've made comics digitally with other programs such as Photoshop Elements and Paint Tool SAI, but this was undoable with PT-SAI and, at times, trying with Photoshop Elements. I had heard good things about this program, so decided to give it a shot, since the Amazon price is VERY reasonable compared to the price straight from the Smith Micro website.<br /><br />This program is really geared toward people who want to create manga (as the software's name implies), so while you can use it for just doodling or hobby art, I personally think there are better options out there for that.<br /><br />One of my biggest errors with this program was that I had set the quality too high. I had read that you should set the quality as high as you can for the best results (of course, makes sense), but it didn't really dawn on me just how LARGE the canvas was. There were times when I'd accidently use the fill tool to try to color an area that wasn't closed off correctly, and it would fill the entire layer. When I'd try to use ctrl+z to undo it, my RAM would cap out and I'd have to close the program. Then when I opened it back up, the page in question had errors. If this happens to you, you can salvage your picture by doing into the story file's folder and deleting the appropriate layer. I'd suggest making a copy of the page's folder before you do so, in case you delete the wrong layer. It's a lot of guess work, and you'll lose the layer, but it's better than losing your whole picture.<br /><br />HOWEVER, none of this is a problem if you set the DPI and canvas size to something your computer can handle! I have 6GB of RAM and thought the higher settings would be fine, but I was wrong. Keep in mind the canvas is generally VERY LARGE. The size I usually work with is 6000x9000 pixels, and that's after shrinking it down a bit.<br /><br />Smith Micro has a lot of video tutorials on their website that are very helpful for new users, and there's plenty more to be found if you rummage around on YouTube.<br /><br />My main complaints involve speech bubbles. While I love the simplicity that this program offers in creating dialogue, it's not perfect in my eyes. For my comic, I wanted to have the characters have different colored speech bubbles. Unfortunately, it only seems to let me make them with a white background. You can fix this by rasterizing the layer and filling in the right color with the paint tool (which works fine, there's no extra white pixels hanging around the text). However, if you realize you've made a mistake, you'll have to fix the original layer, rasterize a new one, then fill the color in again.<br /><br />Even so, this problem is still minor compared to the effort it would take me to make speech bubbles in Photoshop Elements.<br /><br />My last problem is that it doesn't seem to recognize the eraser-tip of my Wacom Graphire 3 tablet pen and treats it as if it were the pen tip. I'm not convinced it acts this way toward all tablet pens though, and this may be something you have to find out for yourself. My pen is around 10 years old.<br /><br />Overall, I love it. Completely worth the money.<br /><br />The good:<br />- Incredibly crisp pen tool<br />- Filters that give you that \""manga\"" feel (such as rendering lightning bolts, speed lines, focus lines, etc.)<br />- Tools that add basic comic features quickly and effortlessly (tons of dialogue bubbles with easy to use tails, panel ruler layer for quick paneling, etc.)<br />- 3D workspace tools to help with perspective<br />- Lots of tutorials for beginners on the company's website.<br /><br />The bad:<br />- Setting up your page size can be confusing<br />- Coloring speech bubbles doesn't seem to work, so needs to be done manually (perhaps I'm just missing something?)<br />- Minor problem with an old tablet pen<br />- Canvas size is LARGE.

Unfortunately, I don't have one but if you do, your pc Lego game should play spectacularly. I've also read from many reviewers that the graphics on the pc are much more crisp than on the Xbox or Playstation versions (it also costs much less).<br /><br />---- Original Review ----<br />The first Lego video game I played was Pirates of the Caribbean on the Xbox 360. And I loved it. The humor was fantastic, the game always kept me interested, the graphics were magnificent, and you get to play dozens of different characters, most of whom have their own unique abilities to help you get through the level. And, as with all Lego video games, it's primarily a puzzle/adventure game with a relatively open world to explore which are features I like.<br /><br />Since I loved the Lego Pirates game so much, I decided to buy the Lego Harry Potter games. (I have Years 1-4 for the Wii and Years 5-7 for the PC). Now for the PC review:<br /><br />Why just three stars? While the general silliness and stunning graphics are very much present in Lego Harry Potter Years 5-7 for PC, the game play itself was clunky at best. I'm not referring to the quality of the puzzles or the story (both of which are excellent); I'm talking about controlling your characters. I don't get motion sick, but I did find myself getting dizzy from the choppy way the characters move on screen. Their movements - partly to blame from my poor handling of the controls, I admit - are not as smooth as they could be because the player is restricted to using keyboard controls only. Even if you go into control settings to change the commands, you'll never have the option to transfer controls to your mouse. It would've been immensely better if Warner Bros. had given us the option to use our mouse to control point of view and to cast spells. But alas, we can't.<br /><br />Not only are the movementsawkward, but certain tasks like spell casting become difficult with just keyboard commands. If I want to blast apart a nearby shrub, I have to hold my H key and then tap, tap, tap my left or right keys to target what I need. It's tedious at best. Much of the time I end up accidentally shooting spells at innocent NPCs like students and ministry wizards. It doesn't hurt them, but it's frustrating to see how often you miss.<br /><br />Point of view is also distorted without a way to independently control it. Sometimes it's difficult to tell which way your character will move. While it seems obvious, I found myself accidentally running into a lot of walls and immovable objects because I couldn't really tell I was going to run into them. That's just because of how the scene is presented on the screen.<br /><br />One last thing: the loading screens last a surprisingly long time. I'd even have enough time to pick up a book and read a few pages before the game started up again. This may be due to my computer, but I thought I'd include it as fair warning. If this happens, try not to get frustrated. There are many 3D elements that need to load. I promise, your game will resume eventually.<br /><br />If you're planning to get the Lego games, don't feel disheartened by my review. The game is wonderful and well worth the time and money so long as the controls are smooth. I'm sure with enough practice, the movements on the PC will become decently tolerable. However, in my personal opinion, if you have multiple platforms on which to play these games, I'd definitely go for the Xbox version. The game is simply designed for those controls. Even the Wii controls are awkward at times. But the PC is by far the worst.<br /><br />ABOUT ME: I'm a 23-year old female and I'm a causal gamer. My preferences are games with vibrant, sometimes cartoon-y aesthetics, puzzle/adventure/RPG/strategy elements, and games that are fast to learn.<br /><br />OTHER GAMES I'D RECOMMEND for PC: The Sims 3, Worms Ultimate Mayhem, Pirate101 (online MMORPG), Puzzle Pirates (online MMORPG), Spore, the Chocolatier series, and Emerald City Confidential.",2012-12-06,730,extra_long,2012-12,games

I'm sorry to say that my spur-of-the-moment investment didn't pay off, and I'm glad it only cost me about $4. Transentience was an independent symphonic metal band from the Netherlands which is no longer active. During their 3-4 year existence, they recorded only one demo and this EP.

Falling - The track opens with a synthesized flute and proceeds to devote most of its next two minutes to melancholy guitar riffing. It's a slow, repetitive song with a very muddled chorus wherein the drums, guitars, and singer Melaina Mulder's vocals all run together. At over six minutes, it's definitely overlong and just not very engaging.<br /><br />2. The Inquisition - This one picks up the pace and is generally a better song. At the very least, it allows you to focus more on Melaina's classical vocals, which are a chip off the ol' Tarja Turunen. The orchestration is a bit better (at least you don't have to judge for yourself which layer of sound you're supposed to listen to), but it's still a bit scatterbrained: there's a keyboard solo somewhere in the middle, but I have no idea what it's doing there - it hardly fits into this song or any of the others. The chorus is better than the first song's but still isn't a real winner.<br /><br />3. Paradox - A foreboding guitar intro, a synthesized organ, and repetitive bap-bap-bapping of the drums: there isn't much to like about this song. The guitar solo near the middle is okay, but again, it doesn't feel like it particularly belongs in the track. The chorus is just some unengaging vocalizing as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />4. Endgame - Like the second track, this one's a bit better than the one before it mainly because it picks up the pace a bit again.

Since then, there have been numerous changes in the band's line-up and musical direction. Their latest effort is \""Antiseptic Bloodbath,\"" which is the first in 9 years. What have they created this time?<br /><br />Simply put, this is the best work they've done in 20 years; it may even be on par with their first three albums. This combines the best traits of the band's previous endeavors - all-out thrashers, crushing mid-paced tunes, the occasional violin or trumpet added to the mix, and an all-star lineup of guest appearances. Neil Kernon handles the production duties this time around, and the end result is the best sounding mix the band has ever had - an absolutely killer rhythm guitar sound pervades every tune, while the drums are pounding without drowning out the other instruments. To break it down song-by-song would look like this:<br /><br />1) \""Chart of the Elements (Lincchostbllis)\"" (6:39). The album opens with a bizarre (for metal music) cheerleader-style call and response done to a marching beat, before a ripping riff kicks off the thrashfest. Insane drumming throughout this song accompanies a bunch of nice riffs. Vocals are a combination of Aaron Guerra's shouts and Luke Easter's vocals. There are several of the classic Tourniquet tempo changes throughout this song, and I can't even count how many different riffs appear. Did I mention the awesome drumming on this song? Ted Kirkpatrick hasn't slowed down a bit. The last part of the song showcases a long, soaring solo by Bruce Franklin (Trouble) before the main thrash riff reappears to close out things. A great song (9.5 of 10).<br /><br />2) \""Antiseptic Bloodbath\"" (6:12). It starts at full speed, with a beat similar to \""Incommensurate\"" from their Pathogenic album. Vocals in the verses are Guerra shouting, while Easter's vocals sometimes have an almost black-metallish whispering here. The tune has a kind of classic \""horror-movie\"" feel to it during the  first half, and then during the second half a bluesy riff begins, and a similarly bluesy solo by none other than the great Pat Travers carries the rest of the song, which is (believe it or not) a rendition of the Christian hymn \""Onward Christian Soldiers.\"" A strange but good tune (8 of 10).<br /><br />3) \""The Maiden Who Slept in the Glass Coffin\"" (7:28). A very nice melodic intro with violin, cello, trumpet, guitar, and drums goes for the first minute, before an amazing solo by Marty Friedman (ex-Megadeth) runs the second minute. The main song then begins with a mid-paced plodding riff and Easter's typical singing style. Certain parts sound very similar to \""Melting the Golden Calf\"" from the band's previous release, \""Where Moth and Rust Destroy,\"" but this tune is far superior to the earlier one. Marty Friedman returns with two more great solos, these faster than the opening one but still very melodic. I love his playing! Diverse styles appear throughout this song, and it's very good (8.5 of 10).<br /><br />4) \""Chamunda Temple Stampede\"" (5:20). Karl Sanders (Nile) shreds right from the opening note, and his solo goes on for the first minute of the song over an awesome mid-paced riff. A different, semi-bluesy riff then comes in for the vocal section. This is a bit like \""Ghost at the Wheel,\"" but much better. This could've been on the \""Vanishing Lessons\"" album, and would've been one of its best tunes. Guerra has a nice solo in the middle of the song before things pick up speed a little and we get a few different heavy riffs to round out the song. Ted has some nice snare fills in this one. Nice mid-paced rocker with serious heaviness (8 of 10).<br /><br />5) \""Flowering Cavader\"" (5:19). A slow version of the song's main riff kicks things off before the thrash onslaught ensues and a sweet thrash riff repeats. We then hear some blastbeats over the fast tremolo-style playing that shows up in earlier songs like the second half of \""Besprinkled in Scarlet Horror.\"" Things shift gears again (it wouldn't be Tourniquet without a bunch of tempo changes), and we get a section that sounds like the last part of \""Drinking from the Poisoned Well.\"" Easter has a real nice vocal section here - soaring singing - and then, just when it sounds like the song is over, that awesome main riff comes back again to finish things, along with some furious double-bass action and a nice solo by Guerra. Awesome tune (9.5 of 10).<br /><br />6) \""86 Bullets\"" (5:12). Melodic but heavy intro before a bluesy riff gets things rolling. A mid-paced rocker that features a super fast solo by Santiago Dobles (Aghora). Things pick up speed a bit for the last part of the song, as Guerra gets in a solo. I haven't mentioned anything about lyrics yet, but this one's about a circus elephant that escapes and is eventually shot and killed (by 86 bullets, I presume). Tourniquet's longstanding concern for animal rights is reflected in this song and in the title track. This is probably the first metal song ever to be sung from the perspective of an elephant (as in the chorus here). A good but not great song (7 of 10).<br /><br />7) \""Duplicitous Endeavor\"" (5:02). Another mid-paced tune, this one written by Guerra and Easter. Nothing stands out especially on this one. There is a spoken word interlude, and Guerra plays a standard solo. Not bad, OK (5.5 of 10).<br /><br />8) \""Lost Language of the Andamans\"" (6:57). A violin and trumpet open things; the trumpet then stops and the bass accompanies the violin for a while - very relaxing melody throughout the first two minutes. That comes to an abrupt end when the thrash begins. It's a \""Tomb of Gilgamesh\""-sounding guitar/violin assault of awesomeness. Easter sounds really good on this one as well. Full speed with a lot of classical melodies and a shredding solo from Santiago Dobles again. Things slow down briefly for listeners to catch their breath, and a cool grooving riff repeats a few times. Some complex drumming here, too. And then we're back to the guitar/violin thrashfest and more amazing guitar soloing. One of the best tunes Tourniquet has ever done (10 of 10).<br /><br />9) \""Carried Away on Uncertain Wings\"" (4:52). Another mid-paced song penned by Guerra and Easter. It has a few start-stop style plodding beats. Easter has some good sections on this one, too. Like \""Duplicitous Endeavor,\"" nothing grabs me here. Not a horrible tune, but just OK (5 of 10).<br /><br />10) \""Fed by Ravens, Eaten by Vultures\"" (8:08). A cello and/or violin open things with a haunting melody before the guitar and drums join things, and a majestic atmosphere ensues. Great little solo by Ted Kirkpatrick on the guitar before a fast thrash riff starts and Guerra's shouting begins. Definite mosh-pit material here. The whole song has an epic quality to it. Some parts bear a small similarity to Tourniquet's classic \""Hand Trembler.\"" The tune closes at a slower pace, but it's accompanied by some dual leads (a la Iron Maiden), the return of the violin and cello, and the most insane drumming from Kirkpatrick. Amazing stuff here... (10 of 10).<br /><br />Guitars: Guerra is a really good rhythm player and that shows up clearly again on this album. Great tone, too. The solos are great as well, which almost goes without saying when you see who's playing them.<br /><br />Vocals: This is the most vocally diverse album Tourniquet has ever done, and I like what I hear this time around. Both Easter and Guerra put in solid performances this time.<br /><br />Bass: Satisfactory bass playing handled by Guerra.<br /><br />Drums: Nothing short of stellar. Kirkpatrick is awesome.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Check this out if you've liked anything the band has done previously.",2012-07-17,1319,extra_long,2012-07,music

The cheating is so bad that deathmatches are often so lopsided that people immediately leave the game and go and vent about cheaters on the Steam forums. Aimbots are the biggest problem by far, with aimbot users scoring up to 100 or more kills and ZERO deaths per match. Then add in simple wallhackers (who don't score as high, but do well enough) who follow you through entire buildings as they wait in a dark corner for you to come into actual view and you have nothing but a recipe for extreme disappointment and frustration.<br /><br />So, basically, unless you are a cheater willing to take a chance at an account ban (which is unlikely to happen, really, if you watch youtube videos) just to have an unfair advantage, then this and EVERY previous and future copy of Call of Duty is for you.<br /><br />If you don't want to play with a bunch of cheaters, losing match after match after match because people have auto-firing aimbots, then stay away from this game. Don't even give it a second look. Valve does not seem to care.<br /><br />Now the reason I gave it 2 stars at all (I was tempted to give it 1) is that when there are NO cheaters in a match, the games are super fun and most of the maps (I'm looking at you, Arkaden!) are actually very fun and present varying degrees of tactical necessity. Lots of tight corners bringing lots of sudden action, the maps for the most part are VERY aesthetically pleasing and make you feel immersed into the environment they intended. Lots of people complain about the graphics but, come on, the engine is till fine. It still renders a pretty picture, especially if you have the hardware to run it all on maximum settings (luckily I do).<br /><br />So, anyway, stay away from this game unless you think you can deal with leveling slowly because of cheaters. Or get this game if all you want to do is cheat and don't mind a 1 in 1,000,000,000 chance at getting banned for it. I do not own a console, but I hear the cheating is just as bad on xbox or whatever it plays on.<br /><br />The ONLY way to get IW/Valve to do anything about this cheating is to hit them in their wallet each time they release a CoD title. If no one ever does that, then no one will ever have a cheat-free Call of Duty experience for more than 1 or 2 matches.<br /><br />TL;DR<br />Game is full of cheaters. Very frustrating.<br />Only get it if you do not mind cheaters with aimbots.<br />Stay away if you can't deal with people who have unfair advantages.<br />Gameplay is actually very nice when no one is cheating in a match.",2012-03-11,498,long,2012-03,games

I'm reviewing this as its own piece, nothing else. I don't care who the band is or whatever history they've gone through. I already know it with these guys, but it doesn't matter to me. This is a music album that I will review as if it's the only one ever created by a no-name group without any history whatsoever. Period.<br /><br />I'll also do another album for comparison's sake so people get the idea here that it doesn't matter how good that band's been before or what direction they're heading, because that doesn't matter. At all. Some will like it, some won't, and people act like that's this amazing new thing to happen in music, and Linkin Park is the first group to ever do it. Go talk to some Slipknot fans and ask them about it. Corey Taylor had a very good reason to resurrect Slipknot, too, and in the absolute worst way possible, even though it was by no means his fault. But let's move on.<br /><br />So, let's just answer the meaningful questions here. Is there heart and creativity here? Clearly, no. The music is mechanical, the lyrics are often incredibly trite, and Chester isn't giving us much reason to care about whatever he's singing. Okay, fine, but does it show some kind of new ground? Nah, not that, either. It's actually just about exactly what you'd expect. You'd have to be a special kind of person to feel any emotion during this when the same concepts have already been explored by the same people, and with words that were a lot more meaningful then. Now we've got that stale, mechanical feel going on. No good. And it goes without saying that I don't want to hear that too often.<br /><br />Now that I've said the obvious about a group that simply doesn't care anymore but still needs some kind of career and publicity, what can we use for comparison's sake? We need something that *does* have heart and emotional impact, right? Okay, fine. Let's talk about one of my favorite examples: Nine Inch Nails' \""The Fragile\"", Reznor's third studio album and home to one of the greatest songs ever created, \""The Day The World Went Away\"".<br /><br />See, this is where \""taste\"" becomes less a matter of opinion. \""The Fragile\"" had a lot of special things going for it: First, Reznor really, really, *really* threw his heart into that one. The lyrics were excellent, clearly inspired by real events in his life (not the least of which being his suicidal intent after making the album). The opening two tracks on disc one, after like, thirteen years, are still capable of making your head pound in the best possible way. The second track in particular was Reznor's masterpiece, second to none. As far as I'm concerned, it's the most moving song ever made, simply due to the undeniable desperation in the lyrics combined with an \""I don't care anymore, this is how I feel\"" in all of Reznor's lyrics, right down to the wordless chant he repeats at the end, like a mantra, just to demonstrate that he can't think of anything better for us.<br /><br />Well, that last part is kind of important. Because, to be honest, \""The Fragile\"" sort of sucked after that for both discs. If it contained a quarter of the quality of its opening two tracks, it would be worth an altar to be worshipped. But it just wasn't particularly good--just like most of the overly noisy and unlistenable stuff NIN brings out literally 95% of the time. Reznor is one of those extremely rare breeds that can come out with album after album with only one or two *really, really* good tracks on them.<br /><br />What was really interesting is, few people even mention this, despite that it's blatantly obvious that most of NIN is noisy garbage with an extremely rare track that is downright fantastic, and is completely different from everything else Reznor comes out with. Yeah, it's weird, but that's what NIN is. And Linkin Park isn't excluded from this--it doesn't get a pass by being good at one point, or you liking it at one point or not at another, or you like some tracks or not some tracks. That's not the point of reviewing an album. Go find a discussion board to rant on.<br /><br />If you don't get the point yet, I'll say it in a sentence instead of illustrating it: You don't judge music by its whole, you judge it by its parts, and you judge it by exactly what you hear and nothing else. It's easy to tell when music has heart and when it doesn't. It's easy to tell when a group is horribly inconsistent in how much effort they put into things, or how much inspiration goes into every song. It's easy to tell when it's solely for continuing a career.<br /><br />So, none of that means a thing to me when reviewing this album, and I'm really a little sick of people always bringing up their past work as if it has some kind of effect on quality. It's like giving Philip Palmer's novels a series of fours and fives out of tens because it seems like every *other* novel he writes is great, whereas the next we can reliably predict to be crap, as if that has any bearing on the work itself--if we were doing that, we'd be handing out zeroes and tens (\""Red Claw\"" remains one of the greatest modern sci-fi novels of the past ten years, and his previous novel remains a complete disaster).<br /><br />The bottom line is that this album sucks, and it stands alone, sucking alone. Linkin Park doesn't suck. Not every song on this album is terrible, but there isn't one that really stands out as extraordinary. It's just that, on average, it sucks pretty bad, with most of the songs being really boring and feeling empty. Oh, hey, I remember their previous work, too, and some of that was cool, and some wasn't--you know, like every other musical group you can buy in a store. But this album? Yeah, forget it. Unless you buy albums exclusively because it's by a band with two or three songs you remember liking from a past album (hi, Amazon MP3!), go make your own series of songs, because most of these are trash. Go back to every Linkin Park album, pull out the good songs, and make a nice little playlist, like most people do. It's like people don't want to admit that the \""skip\"" button is the most used button on any music player, but that's the case. You might like a few songs on here, so get those and add them to your Linkin Park playlist. In the meantime, I'll take NIN's, like, six albums or whatever, and combine all their good songs into the greatest playlist ever created by anyone, which will be the length of maybe three-quarters of a single disc.<br /><br />Really crappy album, maybe a couple of redeeming songs, but definitely not worth the whole thing. Go listen to some samples and pick them out.

While it retains much of the enjoyability of previous Piranha Bytes games, the terrible combat, graphical issues, and lack of climbing and swimming really detract from the overall experience.  Most reviews of the game thus far have labeled it a \""mixed bag,\"" which is very accurate.  Let me briefly list a few of the major issues you should be aware of before you purchase this game.<br /><br />First and foremost, it definitely feels like a Piranha Bytes game.  If you've played Gothic I/II and/or Risen, the style and feel of gameplay is very similar.  I count that to be an enormous mark in its favor.  The combination of a relatively non-linear, explorable world and open-ended rpg elements that made previous Piranha Bytes games great is definitely there, but not quite to the extent it was in previous games.  If you are anything like me, as soon as you start a Piranha Bytes game you go off exploring, climbing everything in sight and trying to get to hidden treasure.  Unfortunately, one of the first things you will notice when you start the game is that you cannot climb or swim.  This is a huge, huge step backwards.  I know it seems like small matter, but climbing exploration was such a huge part of the game for me in previous Piranha Bytes games that the failure to include it is extremely disappointing and makes the world feel significantly smaller.  The map might be as big as previous games, but the fact that you can only go on the flat parts instead of climbing all over the place means that in terms of actual explorable space it is functionally smaller.  And yes, I realize that you can climb in some places, but only where it was scripted, and they are extremely few and far between.  You also cannot swim, which is very annoying in itself, given that the entire game takes place on islands.  It is made even worse by the fact that when you go out too far into the water the screen turns black and you are literally teleported further ashore.  It is quite jarring.<br /><br />Second, the combat is truly awful.  Some people say that Piranha Bytes always has clunky combat, but I love it.  Gothic II's combat was, in my opinion, the best melee combat ever in a rpg.  It was all about skill and timing.  The combat in Risen II is all about luck and stunlocking.  They removed the dodge move from Risen I, and now there is literally no way to get out of the way of attacks.  Against humanoids with weapons the combat is decent at best, with the ability to parry and block at least giving you the time you need to charge your pistol shots or dirty tricks (you can throw sand or other items in their eyes to stun them, but both dirty tricks and your dueling pistol can only be fired once every 20 seconds or so).  Against animals, however, you have no block or dodge, and no choice but to keep saving and loading until you get lucky and hit them enough before they start stunlocking you into oblivion.  Until you get guns (which is about 15 hours or so into the game), any fights against animals are nothing but button mashing, luck, and lots of loading.  It is possibly the most frustrating combat I've ever encountered, rivaled only by the abominations that were the wild boars in Gothic III.  Once you get guns it gets a whole lot easier, but until then, you will spend lots of time looking at that loading screen.  They clearly meant to include a dodge, as right at the beginning an npc tells you that the best way to fight boars is to wait until they charge at you and dodge out of the way.  Only problem is, you can't.  You have no choice but to stand there and take boar tusks to the knees while you impotently try to get your character to finish his sword swinging animation, which keeps getting cut off by the boars' attacks.<br /><br />Third, the graphics leave much to be desired.  The game looks decent enough, if slightly outdated.  I usually do not care about graphics at all.  I could have cared less if they had just reused Risen's graphics engine.  However, even I noticed the graphics in this game, because the problem is that there are a LOT of graphical bugs, several of which are extremely noticeable and frustrating.  Many, if not most, NVIDIA users have problems with flickering trees, and everyone must deal with the ludicrously short draw distances.  They seem to have two draw distances, one for undetailed textures and one for detailed textures.  The undetailed texture draw distance is fine, but the detailed texture draw distance is set to something roughly equivalent to ten feet of game space.  The trees literally change shape and expand and contract as you run past them as the game switches to and from levels of texture detail.  Many of them look like they are imploding on themselves then exploding into leaves.  It's hard to describe, but very strange and annoying.  And while Piranha Bytes lets you modify just about everything in their ini files, for some reason the detailed draw distance is not one of those things.  How this made it past the play testers in beyond me.<br /><br />Now, you may be wondering why I've had so many bad things to say about a game I'm giving four stars to.  It's because this is a good game, but the whole time you're playing it you're thinking how great it could have been.  They have come so, so close to making a truly excellent game, but they fall just short.  It has all the things we loved in the Gothic series; the exploration, the choices, the guilds/factions, the unique characters, investing is unique skills, etc.  But many of those things are merely echoes of what they were in previous games.  They are there, but they aren't there as much as they were before.  If you liked Gothic and Risen, I can almost guarantee that you will like this game.  But you will think how much more you would have like it if they hadn't screwed some of this stuff up so badly.  The fact that I'm giving four stars to a game that has truly awful combatshould be some indication of how good the rest of the game is when you realize that a large portion of your time is spent in combat.  Piranha Bytes may have lost bits and pieces of what made their games great, but Risen II is still a good game and certainly worth playing.  It definitely isn't as bad as Gothic III, but that's not really saying much. The game isn't fundamentally flawed in the way that Gothic III was, so there is still hope that a patch or two could up this game from good to great.  When it comes down to it, though, a year from now when I'm looking to replay an old game, it's going to be Gothic II, not Risen II, that I turn to.<br /><br />Edit (05/15/12):  Now that the first patch has been released, I must amend my review.  Several of my complaints have been addressed, most importantly the combat against animals.  Piranha Bytes has added in both the ability to dodge at any time during fights, as well as the ability to block most animals.  This has significantly improved the combat.  While it is still not a fantastic combat system at its core (too much button mashing instead of skilled timing as compared to their previous games), it is miles ahead of the truly horrific mess it was on initial release.  They have also improved several graphical glitches, notably the flickering trees and Level of Detail draw distances.  The trees and shrubs still change size and shape, but they now do so at a distance instead of two feet in front of you.  Again, it's still not ideal, but it is an enormous improvement.  In all, they adequately responded to two of my three main complaints (very quickly, no less), and while my first and foremost complaint (the decrease in overall openness of the world compared to their previous games) is not likely to be fixed at any point, I am very satisfied with their quick response to public outcry.  My rating of the game has changed from a 7.5 to a 9 in light of the new patch.  It's still not as good as their previous games (excluding the aberrational Gothic III), but the patch has brought it significantly closer.",2012-05-03,1458,extra_long,2012-05,games

Seriously, there are some great parts/concepts.<br /><br />About 2/3 of the way through this book I had to put it down.

An FBI Agent/white witch decides she has to sleep with a convict in a prison interrogation room in order to get information from him. And shares with her partner about the lack of clothing shes wearing under her skirt about 2 minutes before. The author also employs some, what come across to me as cheap, references to Harry Dresdon, and also Millennium the TV Show. There are also X-Files references so apparently the heroes watch that show in their universe but Millennium never got picked up and Jim Butcher never made it as a writer.<br /><br />I can get into fiction/fantasy if it has a well built consistent world.

Other parts grate on the reader.<br /><br />Paraphrased: 'He had some sort of plastic gun like a glock or sig sauer' Also some of heroes use automatic 45 pistols (the term is semi-auto) If an author is going to make his hero condescending about guns because he's some sort of expert he should do the research to back it up. Even in a reality where fbi agents are witches and the main character who goes around saving people needs to be blackmailed into helping the good guys, the heroes make questionable choices and have odd reactions to things, which makes it hard to overlook all of the non sequiturs.

A little Drake here, Chris Brown there, Wiz Khalifa over here, Usher over there, Kid Ink sounds at every turn like he's at a loss for any distinct voice/style of his own.

BF3 is obviously the greatest eye candy war game out there.  But the game play itself could not be any more frustrating for me simply because its so bug ridden due to its inability to handle key bindings.  And no, I'm not making this up or being a n00b.  I don't use ASWD for direction keys, I use the actual arrow keys on the right side of the keyboard.  I do this in ANY game I can bind the keys.  Been doing it for games like Half Life, BF2, COD, etc.  NEVER had had a problem.  Apparently, even though you can use these keys and the ones around them for other actions (DEL for jump, RCtrl for crouch, etc), the game has key sequences it wants to flash on the screen for you to do.  The opening scene where you jump on the train, it took me an HOUR to get the first door open.  Seriously!  I had to Google it.  I NEVER got prompted on the screen to hit [E] to grab the weapon and unwedge the door.  Why?  Because I use the END key to reload since it right above the arrow keys.  The game apparently has no ability to prompt you on the screen to hie [END] to open the door so you just stand there.  Hitting the [END] key does not do anything, even if you would think you could get around it.  And realize the only reason I know now that I was suppose to get prompted to do a key was because I watched a YouTube video of the scene!  I had to change my bindings for a couple of keys because of this issue.  But only after I would die 10 times in a row, get frustrated, watch a YouTube video, and then have to change my bindings.  And then I get prompted to hit a key and can proceed.  Really?  What kind of half assed coding is this for a game?  If you let me bind a key to an action in the menu, then shouldn't I be able to use it?  I would also have problems where I would get to another scene and just get a black screen.  I could fire my gun and hear things, but no video.  ANOTHER known issue!  The only way to get around it is to restart the level!  Really?Go back and do it all over because of a coding glitch?  The game play itself, the story arc, and the graphics engine just absolutely ROCK!!!  Its great!  But the frustrations of having to constantly start over because of coding bugs is inexcusable.

Just before he is sentenced to 30 years of suspended animation in an orbiting Maximum Security space prison, said prison is inexplicably taken over by one inmate who manages to get a hold of a single ankle holster gun. (Maximum security, indeed.) Trapped along with the engineers and other faceless staff of the prison is the American President's daughter. Now the only one crazy enough to try to infiltrate the prison and retrieve the first daughter (as well as -- hopefully -- evidence that will exonerate him) is mouthy Mr. Snow.<br /><br />The glowing reviews on this site and elsewhere tell readers not to think too hard about the plot. One reviewer who might accuse me of \""artistic snootiness\"" writes, \""There are some plot holes and a few maguffins that will leave you scratching your head and wondering why events happened and why characters acted the way they did, but who cares? Have some fun with this romp and let your hair down.\"" Ah ha! That's my problem. My hair is up. Also, I care if movies have plot holes and inconsistent characters. I guess I'm kooky that way.<br /><br />Nuts to that. That's like telling me to \""just have fun\"" at a magic show when I can clearly see the rabbits trying to escape out of the magician's pants. If you're going to spend twenty million dollars to make a film, wouldn't you want it to be fun to watch AND make even just a small amount of sense? Unfortunately, this film is so teeming with lunacy that only those of you willing to register it on the lowest of brainwaves will have fun watching. I knew I was in trouble the moment the prison was taken over by a single inmate, who gets a single gun, and who manages to release all 499 of the other inmates merely by cracking a scientist's head against a glowing control panel. \""Where are all the guards?\"" I wondered. Why does that one gun shoot through that one window, but no other gun in the rest of the movie is able to even crack a pane of glass? Why does this station have automatic weapons that track and destroy spacecraft with the touch of a single, large, glowing silver button, but its orbit requires constant human reconfiguration or it falls out of the sky within an hour? Well, it IS a governmental building, I guess.<br /><br />The only fun to be had is in Pearce's acting. His character is no different than any other Will Smith/Bruce Willis hybrid you've seen before, but at least the seasoned actor appears to be having fun with his role. That's better than can be said for the wooden, one-note performances you get from virtually every single other character, with the biggest transgressor being the President, who appears to have taken his acting lessons from cold toast. Everything else, from the story to the characters to the canned dialogue to the hyper-frenetic editing is just one clumsily executed cliche after another. Even cliches can be fun, but when they are delivered with this kind of halfhearted awkwardness, they are less fun than embarrassing and -- eventually -- annoying.<br /><br />And hey, don't listen to those people who tell you to \""just have fun.\"" Perhaps they haven't heard of \""Moff's Law.\"" I quote, \""[W]hen you go out of your way to suggest that people should be thinking less -- that not using one's capacity for reason is an admirable position to take ... you are not saying anything particularly intelligent. And unless you live on a parallel version of Earth where too many people are thinking too deeply and critically about the world around them and what's going on in their own heads, you're not helping anything...\"" There are a lot of cheesy, enjoyable action films out there that aren't so ludicrously rife with poor writing, directing, and acting, and there's a big difference between \""letting down your hair\"" and putting up with crap just because it's loud, fast, sparkly and on fire.

I read the other reviews stating that the software was broken but thought I would take a chance on it.  In hindsight, I should have trusted the other reviews.<br /><br />As other people have stated, the sync functionality just doesn't work.  I've tried multiple times to get it to sync either to Outlook or to Google Calendar.  In some cases it claims to sync without transferring any data.  Other times it just crashes.  I've never gotten it to actually transfer data.<br /><br />The calendar and to-do functionality is marginal at best.  Calendar entries lack basic fields such as Location.  To-do items have both a start date and a due date, but you can't enter the start date on the same window where you enter the task.  Instead, you have to right click on the task and click 'Reschedule'  Both the calendar and to-do list require numerous clicks or function-key presses to enter a single item.  I haven't bothered with the address book function.  I have hundreds of contacts and refuse to type them all in manually.<br /><br />The software offers a ton of different functions and print layouts, but it's all badly designed and difficult to use.

It touches the nightmare of captivity and the absence of humanity, just pure evil for one's sick private world. Apparently Eli Roth who wrote and directed the first two Hostel films got the original idea when he came across an article that suggested destitute families in Thailand would sell family members to well financed criminals and in turn businessmen from Europe and the US would pay $10,000 to walk in a room and shoot the sold individuals in the head. Shocking and very upsetting.<br /><br />`Taken' (2008) gave us the action and the probability of how huge the human trafficking trade is in the world while the Hostel films just trims the fat off to give you the meat of unbearable acts one human can do to another who's strapped to a chair. Watching these films you can actually imagine the very real possibility of yourself being suddenly taken away and no one will know where you are and you can't escape. That is why this horror franchise stands above other lame film imitations. You will notice the influence of the brilliant `Hangover' films in this third instalment, it's almost a bloody carbon copy horror version of `The Hangover' (2009). The opening scene is great and unexpected, the ending could have been awesome. Unfortunately the makers decided to have a predicable comedy ending, just like so many other horror films do because they are fearful of taking risks. Giving the audience what they want instead of what they don't expect. I hate safe.<br /><br />Putting aside the awful ending I enjoyed this episode, Eli Roth was not involved so I was interested to see how this one would pan out. I love the concept of the `Elite Hunting Club' whereby members have the round bloodhound tattoo. For this film franchise it's a great private members club title with a consistent brand tattoo design. The Vegas environment here is a nice glitzy touch which is a visual contrast for when a lad's stag experience goes horribly wrong.<br /><br />The way the torture chambers are presented in this feature is the best in the trilogy. However, the actual torturing moments lacked the horrific impact of the first two. The first torture scene I found rather unbelievable, but hey, then again what do I know. I'm not in the medical profession nor am I a sicko psycho surgeon. So the nastiness is toned down here and it could have been really uncomfortable and imaginative if the right creative team was on board. Hostel III is gentle brutality compared to the other two but it did hold my attention. To bring the franchise way ahead of acceptable same old same old horror, if they make a fourth episode, whoever produces and directs need to create an experience that will be traumatic, unexpected and compelling.

And there was some originality to it that was pretty great and interesting. So, yeah, see my dilema?<br /><br />I should start by saying that the cover of this book is just amazing. Truly gorgeous. I think it is very eye catching and just draws you in.<br /><br />The concept of a human with a gene that, if made a vampire would make her powerful and dangerous and therefore feared and of course a target for other vamps to go after, was fun and original and entertaining.<br />.<br />The varying cast of characters, again nice, but, the love interest, their romance and instant love for one another (willingness to forgive unthinkable acts and possessiveness from Nickolae), the battle with the vampires over Crimson (which is an awesome name for a character by the way), the mysterious leader of the vamps in a foreign country and his creepy sidekicks?<br /><br />Well sometimes it was just a little too much like Twilight for me and I found myself shaking my head at the likeness.<br /><br />I know, terrible of me but I couldn't help but feel that way, and I did like Twilight, don't get me wrong on that count, I just didn't want this to be so much like it and I don't even know if the author was aware that she was making so many similarities to be honest. They were pretty subtle sometimes.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong though, what was original about the story was good. The writing was fine and the characters were loveable, I especially liked Crimson and how feisty she was, but things, especially their love for one another, just moved way too fast for me. They were in love after one meeting, like crazy, sick in love. I think I would have liked to see their love grow a little over time.<br /><br />The story started off with a vampire stalking Crimson but we don't really get why or really learn anything about this vampire. In fact, it is easy to forget that he is even there since we see so little of him throughout the story. I would have liked to see that played out a little better than it was. I think it would have put a little more action into the story and spiced it up a little.<br /><br />The ending too was a little confusing. Why throw in her cousin Haley wondering about Crimson's safety? Was it a lead up to a sequel? It left me feeling a little lost.<br /><br />Overall though this was a fun fast read that I think lovers of Twilight will really enjoy and have a good time reading. The characters and storyline are different enough that it isn't too predictable or slow and it isn't a rip of the Meyer's work.<br /><br />If there is going to be a sequel I would be really interested to see what happens next and see if some of the similarities of other series die down and little and this takes on more of a life of its own.<br /><br />I think the author has great potential and has come up with something interesting and fun to read about that any lover of vamps and the paranormal will enjoy.ally get why or really learn anything about this vampire.

The characters and storyline are different enough that it isn't too predictable or slow and it isn't a rip of the Meyer's work.<br /><br />If there is going to be a sequel I would be really interested to see what happens next and see if some of the similarities of other series die down and little and this takes on more of a life of its own.<br /><br />I think the author has great potential and has come up with something interesting and fun to read about that any lover of vamps and the paranormal will enjoy.",2012-06-03,800,extra_long,2012-06,ebooks

May we burn her?,"\""Season of the Witch\"" is one of those movies that probably would have gone straight to SyFy/Sci-Fi, if it didn't have an A-list actor attached. It's a murky, rather rushed historical creep-out that blossoms into silly horror at the end, after a long journey where not very much happens. Ron Perlman is awesome, though.<br /><br />Disgusted with the slaughter of the Crusades, knights Behmen (Nicholas Cage) and Felson (Perlman) desert the army to return home to... somewhere. I think it's England, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />They arrive in a town infested with the Black Death, and are quickly arrested. But the local bishop (Christopher Lee) offers them a way to clean their slates -- take a witch (Claire Foy) who is blamed for the plague to a distant abbey where she will be depowered courtesy of an ancient spellbook. The embittered Behman doesn't believe she's a witch, but he agrees nevertheless.<br /><br />Along with a priest, a soldier, a swindler and an altar boy who dreams of knighthood, the two knights take the suspected witch on the perilous journey. But soon Behman starts to suspect that there's something unnatural about her -- she has super-strength, summons wolves, and even makes one man hallucinate right to his death. But no one can guess the horrific truth about what she is until they reach the abbey.<br /><br />\""Season of the Witch\"" isn't a horrible film, but it is resolutely mediocre -- it has the feel of a movie where nobody was really trying very hard. In fact, the first three-fourths of the movie just sort of ooze by with lots of dirty medieval villages, spooky hints about the witch girl, and lots of misty forests full of giant wolves.<br /><br />Even the cameramen and screenwriters aren't trying too hard. It's almost impossible to see what the heck is going on in the fight scenes, except that there are lots of swords and leaves. The dialogue is pretty standard buddy-cop stuff, and is laid out in a hodgepodge of inconsistent accents. Are these Crusaders SUPPOSED to sound so American?<br /><br />The movie does pick up for about ten minutes when the characters reach the abbey -- storms of darkness, zombie monks, incantations, and a decent Linda Blair impression. The problem is.... we see the bad guy. And it looks RIDICULOUS -- I've seen Star Trek prosthetics that were scarier than that, especially when it starts flitting, scuttling and spinning around the place.<br /><br />The acting is pretty lackluster -- Cage is phoning in his performance, and most of the supporting characters are so blandly underdeveloped that you can't really care when they get offed. I will say that Stephen Campbell Moore does a decent job as a priest whose faith helps him overcome his fear, and Robert Sheehan and Claire Foy are very earnest in their roles. Oh, and Ron Perlman is lots of fun as Felson. It's pretty obvious he knows he's in a stinker, so he decides to have fun with his laid-back, fun-loving character.<br /><br />\""Season of the Witch\"" could have been a semi-decent horror thriller if it had kept the bad guy hidden, but that makes the entire climax fall apart.up for about ten minutes when the characters reach the abbey -- storms of darkness, zombie monks, incantations, and a decent Linda Blair impression.

Nothing out there at the moment has gathered those hits together, never mind their B-sides, not even this 26-track mp.3 collection optimistically - but way off the mark - labelled \""The Very Best Of.\"" In fact, the ONLY such hit included here is Big Daddy, her last in September 1958 which hit # 96 Billboard Pop Top 100 on Columbia 41202 with the backing of the Glenn Osser orchestra (the flip, Wherefore Art Thou, Romeo, is omitted).<br /><br />After that she left the business when she married Pittsburgh Pirate Don Hoak, and only returned to music after Hoak died of a heart attack following 8 years of marriage (they had a daughter, Clare). She would, however, never attain another hit single.<br /><br />Her interest in music began at a young age when she began emulating one of her favorites, Carmen Miranda, but at age 13, winning a number of talent shows and eventually landing her own radio show. When Columbia major-domo Mitch Miller heard a tape, he recommended she audition for both Arthur Godfrey and Dave Garroway and ultimately, although both showed interest, she chose Garroway's offer (a wise choice considering the later actions of the ego-maniac Godfrey and his public firing over the air of Julius LaRosa). It was Garroway who suggested the stage name Jill Corey.<br /><br />In January 1954, at age 19, she registered her first hit single when Robe Of Calvary made it to # 22 Pop with the support of the Percy Faith orchestra on Columbia 40123 b/w Minneapolis. After that the hits were hard to come by, but in late 1956/early 1957 - and right at the start of the R&R Era - her cover of the 1926 Fred Waring & His Pennsylvanians' hit, I Love My Baby (My Baby Loves Me) got as high as # 22 on Columbia 40794 billed as Jill Corey with Jimmy Carroll. The B-side was Egghead. The same billing then had a two-sided charter in April 1957 with Let It Be Me, a French tune whose English version by Jill had been introduced on the CBS TV series Climax. It peaked at # 57 in May and would later be covered with varying degrees of success by The Everlly Brothers, Betty Everett & Jerry Butler, Arthur Prysock, The Sweet Inspirations, Glen Campbell & Bobbie Gentry, and Willie Nelson. The flip, Make Like A Bunny Honey on Columbia 40878, finished at # 95.<br /><br />Under her own billing, but still accompanied by the Carroll orchestra, she then had her best hit ever with the August 1957 # 11 Love Me To Pieces, which she had also performed on the July 15, 1957 Studio One Summer Theatre Production with the same title.  On Columbia 40955, the flip was Love. About a year later she had her final hit as mentioned above.<br /><br />Her TV work included the Garroway, Robert Q. Lewis, Ed Sullivan and Johnny Carson variety shows, as well as her own featured programs, and she was one of the vocalists in the last days of Your Hit Parade. Her only appearance in a feature film came in 1959 in the Columbia musical  Senior Prom.<br /><br />It is frustrating for hits collectors such as myself to see several Jill Corey compilations available, NONE of which make any attempt to include her charted titles.

US,14463936,R2O2SGVTOKHQLI,B006XFALZ0,956844762,The Missing,Digital_Music_Purchase,4,0,0,False,False,Great debut album.,"Review by Matthew Forss<br />  Rating: 4.5 stars (out of 5)<br /><br />  Anthony Nesossis (pronounced Knee-so-sis) is an artistic visionary with an ear for the auditory. The musical medium of choice is primarily in the electronic and techno realm with equal doses of spacey atmospherics and robotic voices. Anthony transcends normal innovation by breaking borders and rules regarding electronic forays into spacey, dance music.<br /><br />  \""Future Past\"" opens with a few seconds of crinkly, electronic noise before a swishy, but steady percussion beat takes over. Soon after, a few, deep bellows off-set the shaker-like sound quality of the hi-hat accompaniment. A reverberating keyboard signals a new musical direction for the song which seems like it is going into a full-on rave beat. However, the reverberations end with a robotic voice saying `future,' before the steady, yet swishy, metallic beat commences with only slight interruptions throughout. For instance, the robotic, `future' voice only shows up a few times before the end of the song is signaled by the same robotic voice saying, `the past is not the future.' \""Signs of Life\"" opens with fast-paced, metallic displays of radio-frequency bleeps seemingly emanating from an alien starship floating through the universal abyss. The sound is briefly accompanied by a few piercing synth sounds that continue along with the steady, dance beat that emerges within the first minute. The dance beat contains a few, metallic tube sounds that border on punchy flutes. The danceable track surely shows signs of life from the first few notes.<br /><br />  \""Dreams of Earth\"" begins with a cascading sound of metallic noise amidst a foreground of steady, electronic percussion. The rather rudimentary beat is livened with scintillating sounds of metallic beauty that make it a little more interesting. \""Sun Will Shine\"" is a down-tempo hit an Air or Zero 7-esque beat with fluid keyboards, languid percussion, and atmospheric washes. Bubbly water noises break up the sound with some robotic voices. The track is a little short--at only three-minutes--but the time seems to linger on and on, which is a very good quality. \""Let The Sun In (Como Los Rayos Del Sol)\"" opens with spacious, atmospheric sounds and echoing, electric, female vocals that are spoken words; rather than singing. The techno beat includes some washes and metallic tones that might be heard on an alien spaceship--or video game soundtrack from planet Earth.<br /><br />  \""Awakening\"" almost sounds like a rock song without guitars. The percussive beat begins after a mix of insect or nature sounds becomes amplified and then fades away. The percussive beat is probably the most adventurous on this track. There are hints of conga or bongo type sounds with the bass lines and cascading, electronic sounds throughout. The track ends with the same insect or nature sounds heard in the beginning. \""And Then It Rained (Original Mix feat. Kevin Beale)\"" opens with a few, bass-heavy and pensive notes with a clap of thunder and rain sound at the beginning of a robotic voice that reads Biblical-type lines. The blurby electronic noises are accompanied by a jazzy, drum-kit repertoire with swishy noises and metallic pings. \""Signs Of Life (Xavier Mathias Mix)\"" is the final track that differs from the other track with the same name by a more techno-focused composition with a little funk thrown in for good fun.<br /><br />  The Missing is an intelligible product of human achievement that contains techno-dance grooves, spacey electronica, and percussive beats that can get any party started. The few electronic vocals used sporadically throughout the album makes the music flow without any issues. Despite similar-sounding beats on some of the tracks, Anthony knows how to mix it up with electronic embellishments. The Missing is appropriately-titled, because this is what music fans are missing from their collections. This is perfect for fans of down-tempo, techno, electronic, and dance music.",2012-05-02,641,extra_long,2012-05,music

This song was written and performed by the original Outlaw himself, Hughie Thomasson. Henry Paul has been in out of the Outlaws 4 or more times, while gone; Hughie pushed on, after many of the original band members left, Hughie was the only one keeping the band alive. The last two times Henry Paul rejoined, Hughie owned the name and the rights to the Outlaws. Henry was brought back as a player in Hughie' band and signed agreements in both 1985 and 2005 that he had no control or use of the band and name the Outlaws. Henry re-joined for a 30th anniversary reunion tour at Hughie's request in 2005 and again signed an agreement that he had no claims to the band or name Outlaws. Henry's stint with the reunion Outlaws of 2005 was short lived, he left as soon as he found out that his old band Blackhawk was signed to a new record deal. Well that fell through and Henry was out of a job again. All along, Hughie played on with a reunited Outlaws band with some old band mates and some new players.<br /><br />Then one night in September 2007, after having dinner with his wife, Hughie suffered a fatal heart attack and died peacefully in his sleep.<br /><br />At Hughie's funeral, Henry Paul had the nerve to concoct a plan to steal the Outlaws name away from its rightful owner, Hughie's wife, Mary Thomasson.<br /><br />At first, Henry was respectful and paid the Thomasson estate royalties for using the name, but then the black hole of a soul in Henry started to kick in. Henry started re-recording old Outlaws standards and releasing them on iTunes.<br /><br />Unsuspecting fans would buy an Outlaws song that had been sung by Hughie, only to find this new version with Henry Paul on lead.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, I like Henry's voice on many of Henry's songs, Gunsmoke, Freeborn man, Girl from Ohio and my favorite, Song in the Breeze.<br /><br />But to hear Henry sing Hughie's songs? Not at all appealing to me, two totally different sounds, Henry, please stop trying to sing Hughie's songs, at least find a singer with a similar voice to Hughie!<br /><br />Anyway, Henry started doing these nefarious things and when Mary Thomasson asked him to stop, not only did he keep on, but also he stopped paying her for the Outlaws name, had the Webmaster change the password and steals the Outlaws Website!<br /><br />Long story short, both sides lawyer up, went to court over this and in my total disbelief, Mary Thomasson lost, even with the legal papers Henry signed stating he had no rights to the Outlaws in both 1985 and 2005.<br /><br />Total injustice!<br /><br />So now, Henry is living off the name and reputation of our dear departed members and thumbing his nose at the Thomasson family!<br /><br />Do not buy this nor buy tickets to any of their live shows, you will be supporting at best the worst manors I have ever seen in the music business.<br /><br />What not just tour as the Henry Paul Band?",2012-08-26,537,extra_long,2012-08,music

If you are end of life on your Quicken program and have to upgrade this \""upgrade\"" is not that great. However you're stuck upgrading if you are use to balancing check books and downloading transactions.<br /><br />Review: Overall the checkbook features, 401k, and stock features are fine. I give this a 3.5 out of 5. They are bit more cumbersome than Q2009. So that part is good. I have not lost data yet as some have nor do I have issues with the \""Business\"" section as I have not used it yet. What is absolutely killing me is the budget section. It's interface is confusing and I actually have to use a pen, paper, and calculator to check my numbers to see if I'm going over. In Q2009 there were features that allowed you to quickly see if you were over for the month or had extra. Also forget about balancing last months budget on the 1st (i.e., balance May 2012 on June 1, 2012). You're locked out!! You can't change any values. Basically you have to change the date on your computer to go a day back. I give the budget and report section a 1 out 5.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend just using a spread sheet for now. Wait until another program comes out or Quicken resolves these issues. I was considering jumping to Microsoft Money but I found out it's no longer made. So I was stuck upgrading. I am seriously considering going back to pen and paper. The budget tool is key for me and it is a pain to use.<br /><br />********<br /><br />There are a lot of negative reviews about this product and I'm definitely not happy about some of the changes to QHB 2012. However those are more aesthetic changes I don't like such as some prety graphs not readily available. This is my second try with this product (originally purchased 1/2012, returned 10 days later) since my old version is end of life (EOL). The main reason for my dislike is the budgeting pages.<br /><br />What I like:<br />- Looks good, nice colors, cool new layout. Quicken is making it different so it looks new. A little repackaging of the same thing.<br />- Ability to update accounts from Institutions<br />- I have up to date software that is no longer EOL.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />- Budgeting section is complex and I will have to relearn how to use it and balance out every month.<br />- If I have Advanded Budget open along with an \""Easy Answer Budget\"" report, the report updates everytime I change data. This add so much time. So I change one field, the report updates, click to another field, the report updates, update the field selected with data, ... you get the idea. This was the main reason I returned the software in the first place. In the older version I could update my budget as much as I wanted and the report would only update when I selected it.<br />- The regular budget (as opposed to Adv Budget) is complicated. It's a hassle to figure out what all the \""extra\"" data is for and parsing it out. I just need the bare minimum and there are all these extras. Basically I will have to take a weekend to relearn just this one piece. When updating I don't expect having to learn how to do the minimum, the learning curve comes from learning the new cool features.<br /><br />Overall Recommendation:<br />If you have to up date just do it. It's not the best product out there but it's the only product. IF ANOTHER BUDGETING SOFTWARE APPLICATION COMES OUT AND IS BETTER I WILL BUY IT. I was actually going to convert to Microsfot Money in Jan 2012 after my first try with this software but that's when I found out they were no longer around.<br /><br />Other problems reported were:<br />- Bugdet figures disappearing after hours of work. --- Have not experienced this yet.<br />- Problems installing. Recommended to uninstall old version, reboot, and install new version. --- I did this. No problems with new install.<br />- Problem converting old Quicken file. --- Had no issues although I did make multiple back ups just in case.<br />- QHB 2012 extremely slow, possibly fixed after SP5. --- I'm up to date and it seems to run fine for me.<br />- One Step Update takes a long time. --- First time I ran it it did take a while but after that it was quick.

My return is simple enough that I could probably get by without buying the Deluxe version, but I usually do.  I thought about saving a few bucks by using the online version but I'm afraid to.  Your data on someone else's server is another opportunity for disgruntled employees or hackers to destroy your life.  And, when you get ready to print, their servers may be down or overloaded.  So, I always purchase.  The Amazon download and install worked flawlessly and the installer created a Windows backup just in case I had a problem.  As I said in the title, one problem is that every year they make significant changes to the GUI. Some of these are clearly improvements and others are probably due to tax law changes.  In the end, it's pretty easy to use the wizards to fill out the forms.  The \""final\"" check is very useful in that it finds \""errors\"" that may or may not be errors.  In my case, I left a 1099 placeholder for a bank that I thought I might be getting interest from.  It saw that I had not entered data, a good reminder to do so (or delete, as I did later).  Then, it said that I hadn't entered some data in another form.  Selecting the \""forms\"" mode, I was able to enter the missing data.  I don't know if I forgot to enter the data or if TTax forgot to ask.  Finally, it said that I had not entered data for \""installment income\"".  I don't have any of that.  It requires a little bit of detective work to figure out how this form was generated.  They COULD point you to one of the wizards to re-run and look for the source of the problem.  In this case, it looked like there is a TTax error.  On one page, the \""installment income\"" checkbox was checked and could not be unchecked.  I entered \""none of the above\"" but the block remained checked.  Fortunately, I was able to delete the form and finish. So, this looks like an error.  From past experience, I'm used to getting TTax updated virtually every time I started it.  But, my TTax said my version was \""up to date\"".  Here it is, mid-February, and we have \""bugs\"" like this that should have been fixed.  I'd like to go ahead and submit my return as I'm getting money back but I'm afraid that there will, as in the past, be more TTax updates.

Most of the noise, both pro and con, concerning Lady Gaga currently exists in the form of hastily ejaculated, poorly punctuated ranting. I write this for people who are truly curious about this album's sound, more specifically its place in the wider music world.<br /><br />Lady Gaga's been enjoying immense success and popularity recently, building a reputation among the mostly uncritical press as a daring and original multimedia \""artiste.\"" I thought Poker Face was a smart and sassy pop song, and am still impressed with the theatrical sound of Bad Romance, but I've largely been underwhelmed with Lady Gaga's output. Generally, her stuff falls into one of two categories: 1) \""not bad, but it doesn't really stand out,\"" or 2) \""this sounds WAY too much like (past pop hit) for my comfort!\"" She's loads better than Katy Perry, and no worse than someone like Christina Aguilera, but I've never understood where the fanatical obsession came from. Perhaps this is simply reflective of contemporary music culture, specifically of listeners who have abandoned earlier generations' standards of greatness in performance, yet are still drawn like moths to the flame to worship anyone who happens to be in the spotlight, as if they were the next (past legend). Whatever it may be, the fact remains that \""Born This Way\"" is a largely homogeneous, forgettable affair. Many of the cuts likely sizzle in the clubs, but staying power is not the order of the day.<br /><br />The album's strongest song is the opener, Marry the Night. The stomping beats and sleazy, buzzing synths make it a perfect club anthem. The problem is that, save for the modern production, it's just a by-the-numbers Eurodance anthem from the early '90s. It's practically begging to have a corny rap interlude (eg: \""gonna marry the night, cuz it feels so right; when I drive in my car, I look up at the stars,\"" etc). It's fun, but I've largely heard it before...<br /><br />From there, it's more familiar territory. The title track is a shameless rip of Madonna's Express Yourself (Madonna herself called it \""reductive\""), Edge of Glory sounds a hundred other Cher-styled disco stompers, Government Hooker is a lesser version of Britney's Gimme More, and Judas just \""sounds WAY too much like (Bad Romance) for my comfort.\"" Most of the other songs are embarrassing exercises in style (Americano, You & I), rehashes of other songs on the album (Bloody Mary), or just nondescript dancefloor filler. Scheisse is kind of fun, but I doubt I'll ever think to play it a few years from now.<br /><br />The production is well done, but over the course of the entire album, it feels very samey, with almost no contrast or breathing room available. The net result is a competent, effervescent pop experience that, while great for the dancefloor, is wearisome and not likely to endure the test of time.<br /><br />It's obvious that Gaga has some talent, but this album shows no growth from her debut, only amplification. There may eventually be an album in her career that finally pulls me into her orbit of adoring moths, but this one isn't it.It's fun, but I've largely heard it before...

To get through half the picture you will need to suspend your disbelief to the point of drooling in your popcorn. This is the sort of film recycled with parts from much better movies (Collateral, Kalifornia, Cape Fear, Jackson's own Lakeview Terrace), so surprises aren't exactly in store, the dialogue is painful to hear and the characters bear no resemblance what so ever to real people, they don't even bear any resemblance to movie characters; for example their is a small child and her dog who stand in the same spot for what must be hours in movietime, and it is for no discernible reason. Who this film exists for could be a study unto itself, but anyone with a working braincell or any self respect need not apply. This is more along the lines of audiences who wish not to be entertained, perhaps have never seen a better movie, or just like to say that they have sat through a film of near unbearable pain and lived to tell about it.<br /><br />The plot has timed, mild mannered real estate agent John (Luke Wilson) having a real sad sack of a day, he lost his job, his mortgage is in foreclosure, he has a stack of bills that read \""past due\"", and he fights with his wife (Leslie Bibb) for no particular reason. Then Richie (Samuel L. Jackson) enters his life, at first unassuming, but soon he reveals his very dark nature. Richie turns out to be a psychopath on a killing spree, a dozen in under an hour from my calculations, and he brings John unwittingly along for the ride. Richie's motives seems to be nothing more than to turn John into a killer like him, or perhaps he believes it will turn him into a man like him. Obviously this will end up with John being mistakenly suspected of the crimes by the local inept authorities, of course it all ends at John's house over dinner with Richie terrorizing the wife and kids.<br/><br />The film tries to work on a more psychological level, I guess, but it totally fails. The movie never actually explains any motives for the killing spree or any insight into the Jackson character, it seems as if he is supposed to be the embodiment of evil, possibly even the devil himself, but he is actually just a remorseless killer, or is he. The film leads to a dubious denouement, followed by a rather obvious cliched confrontation and then an unsatisfying anti-climax. This picture looks like it is under the inept impression that is supposed to be a character study, but it has no characters to study.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson is easily one of the best actors of his generation, but of late he has been stuck in something of a rut, he plays leads in terrible movies that go mostly unseen (The Cleaner, Unthinkable, Arena) and his successes of late have been cameos in superhero flicks. Here he plays a caricature of the Sam Jackson character, something else he has been doing a lot of lately, after just a few minutes of his shtick here the performance becomes unbearable to watch. Luke Wilson doesn't fare much better, in fact he is unable to conceal his boredom with this trite, tedious material. But some of the supporting work is much worst, I suspect some of these \""actors\"" were just friends, relatives, or investors. Supporting characters are portrayed even more dimly like the local police, embodied by Muse Watson as a cranky old veteran, and Tracie Thomas as his black stereotype female partner named Latisha.<br /><br />Directed by Chris Fisher, who adapted the screenplay from a novel by Thomas Berger (Little Big Man, Neighbors), I had never heard of this filmmaker before so I did a check on him over at IMDb, I soon discovered why I did not know him. Up to this point he has been known for directing some pretty poorly received direct-to-dvd potboilers, titles like \""S. Darko\"", \""Street Kings 2: Motor City\"", \""Dirty\"", \""Nightstsalker\"", \""Rampage: The Hillside StranglerMurders\"". \""Meeting Evil\"" is Fisher's first theatrical film, well sort of, you see it's premiering on cable/satelite TV and then video on demand, before receiving a belated theatrical release in a few theaters. I suspect the limited theatrical release is an attempt to help Jackson save face, but they shouldn't have bothered, his career will be better served the sooner that this one is forgotten.<br /><br />I know, I know  if you can't say anything nice, ...just one more thing, please. Add to this some of the most cloyingly pretentious cinematography, provided by Marvin V. Rush, a close collaborator on some of Fisher's previously mentioned glories. Even at roughly ninety minutes \""Meeting Evil\"" truly feels like an evening of unbearable torture. Yes, I believe that this the definition of torture porn.",2012-05-03,836,extra_long,2012-05,videos

Because of that, I as a reader want to like her, or at least feel some sympathy for her, but that doesn´t happen with this story, beacuse after the attack she is so unpleasant and self-centered. She turns down offers of counseling and help, she refuses to let anyone know she has been raped, but still she is mad at people for not giving her special treatment after the attack and she breaks up with her boyfriend in a very unkind way.<br />I struggled with this for the first half of the book, not wanting to feel so critical towards someone who had been the victim of such a crime, who am I to be the judge of post-rape behaviour?

Artistic integrity... uh sure. This doesn't involve the domineering view of what a single writer thinks qualifies as a good ending...    (read this: [...])    Therefore the original ending should have been cut out completely. As MrBtongue said the extended cut was simply throwing good writing on top of bad.    Also it is blatantly obvious this game was being marketed for mass appeal, hence the auto dialogue (I mean like talking to DLC players in ME2), multiplayer content, fetch quest planet scanning, and COD like combat controls. Remember when Mass Effect used to be about good story telling and not fast pacing? I prefer good storytelling to improved combat any day.    The story itself was incoherent, the only choice should have been destroy and the choices surrounding that should have been how. But no, the reapers are are friends, our genocidal, war-mongering friends. So the plot devices of the first two games are irrelevant. We should have just let sovereign take over the citadel or let the collectors abduct the entire human race. The star brat is the new protagonist and Shepherd is, well... what about him/her. The reapers are the good guys, and Shepherd is suddenly a menace (Okay I'm exaggerating but his/her role is abruptly diminished in the end).    (For those of you who have no idea what I am saying, here are the three endings in a nutshell)    Sure we ended the reaper threat with the choices the star brat gave us, but we lost our souls in the process, which I seem to recall Shepherd saying we wouldn't. We either destroy all synthetic races (genocide), control the reapers (as galactic overlords or \""peacekeepers\"") or we synthesize and homogenize all cultures and races (imperialism and genocide). Or we can choose the morally right option and reject our reaper overlords, which results in our extinction(but the reapers get destroyed in the next ending). These choices are abhorred and the morally correct ones are implied to be incorrect or morally reprehensible. Oh and good job destroying the masterfully thought up indoctrination theory, Bioware sufficiently extinguished all hope of an epic ending to mass effect simply because it interfered with Bioware's \""artistic vision\"" (which is incoherent).

It's probably a smart business decision, given the economics of selling recordings; the orchestra can get its concerts out in public without the risk of producing compact discs. Viewed from afar, it seems that the Toronto orchestra, which has always played second fiddle to Montreal, has been feeling a breath of fresh air under Peter Oundjian, the violinist of the Tokyo Quartet who reshaped his career after a hand injury into becoming a conductor. Now 56 and Toronto born, Oundjian is the hometown boy who made good.<br /><br />Morale feels high in these spirited performances of RVW's Fourth and fifth Sym., which capture the composer at his peak as a symphonist. The scores are a contrast in style, with the Fourth being the most rackety and dissonant of the nine symphonies, but the turmoil of the first movement gives rather a false impression. RVW was not a modernist at heart, and when we enter the understated pastorale of the fifth, we are closer to his real forte. The fourth pointed in a direction that he only followed in the sixth, in that both seem to be reactions to the horrors of war and 20th-century violence in general. But like Carl Nielsen, RVW denied any program in music where audiences and critics felt a strong tug of the programmatic.<br /><br />The British are admirably faithful to their own, and we have lots of superb recordings of these two works from every era, not to mention an outlying account of the Fourth from Leonard Bernstein and the NY Phil. that may be the best of all; going back to historical recordings, the composer himself led a blistering Fourth. Oundjian isn't a first-rate conductor, and although his musicianship enables him to hold the reading together and get energetic playing, there's no real interpretation here.  One event follows another to make an agreeable impression, that's all. Being easier music to lead, the lyrical sections of the Fifth comes off best here, delivering a serene mood and flowing melody.<br /><br />I realize that audiences, musicians, and critics are often satisfied with this level of performance, and for them the TSO Live download seems well suited.

The majority of supporting actors do not even need to be present. You could carry out this plot with four actors, some extras, and then some voice over from the shadows. I don't blame the actors; Forest Whitaker and De Niro have given outstanding performances in the past (De Niro not lately), and 50-cent has at times performed well enough to indicate some marginal potential. There does not necessarily seem to be a lack of money in this picture; the blame seems to lie with a director choosing a less than mediocre script, and absently accepting C/D level performance.

The story was great, the characters were interesting, and the ending was epic.  I liked this entry, but I didn't love it (really more of a 3.5 star rating). Also, this is mildly SPOILERISH.  Like a few other reviewers, I think my main issue is with Valerie.  I don't get her motivations for her actions...I understand her misgivings, her trust issues, even her nostalgic feelings.  None of that really explains her actions.  They did not read as organic for me, very few things she did were done with any type of actually reflection..I just didn't connect with her as much this time around.  Jack, I like that he had more depth, but I'm not crazy about the direction he is headed in & not for obvious reasons (I didn't feel like he & Val were ever really MEANT for each other).  Despite the misgivings of the heart, what really upset me was the concept of family these people have (meaning the things that go on between Val & Jack, aside from the romantic aspect don't match what they are saying, even in monologue about how they feel for each other as family).  And Lucas, poor Lucas.  Damned if you do, damned if you don't I guess.  I'll also admit to be vehemently team Lucas (I'm usually on the vampire side of things-at least for the romantic lead.)  This brings us to the new player in town, Cer-King of the Fey.  I really like the history of the Others in this Universe, so I was glad to get to meet him & see his side but why Val (at first) would trust as much as she did is beyond me.  Everyone knows fairies are not to be trusted!  I enjoyed the ending, which was very similar to the first book in how the reader will feel about it & if this goes beyond a trilogy that might get annoying..But for now I am eagerly awaiting the next installment.  If you like the 1st one read this.  Not nearly as good as the first as it is the second installment it is just a continuation of the story, sort of a filler episode where some necessary narrative things have to happen to get us to the pay-off.

We upgraded because we had to for some interoperability with some other software we use but we haven't noticed much difference between 2011 and 2012.  The one thing I HATE about Intuit is that they are ALWAYS trying to sell you on something.  Whether its on the phone to activate the software, in the software itself or anywhere else, the one major point of contention I have with them is that I just want to be left alone to run my business and I don't want to be solicited every time I turn around.  For those that complain about or are concerned about not being able to run your 2000 version of QuickBooks anymore, this is not just an Intuit thing.  People are demanding more and more of their computers so Hardware, Operating Systems and supplemental software (like what Intuit provides) has to change.  Has Hardware changes (ie. 64 bit), Operating System have to change their structure to handle/use that expanded hardware.  As Operating Systems change, there is only so much backwards compatability that can be provided until the work it takes you to constantly be backwards compatible is so constraining that you can't move forward.  Microsoft and Intuit aren't the only companies that play in this world...Apple, Adobe and all of the others do this as well.

I haven't really read any books that took place in New Orleans and, with the mention of voodoo queens and ghosts - not to mention a gorgeous blue cover and multiple glowing, raving reviews - I was excited. Of course, I had to clear away the books in my review pile, first, which took some time. And now? I'll be blunt and say that I regret really looking forward to reading BOUND, and skipping multiple books in my review pile to do so.<br /><br />Grammar was the largest issue here. Proper grammar is crucial in writing and publishing a book. After all, if a book's riddled with grammar errors, it'll make the book harder to read and understand, which will then cause those who don't have that much patience to give up and find something else to read. Proper grammar. It saves books. It saves lives. But it didn't save BOUND, because BOUND was one of the books in the 'Riddled With Grammar Errors' category I mentioned before. Just the first page was filled with grammar errors, and there was literally a one in each paragraph, if not in each line. The first page alone contains multiple comma splices, dependent clauses that somehow were left to stand on their own, missing conjunctions, missing commas, unnecessary periods, capitalization errors, and incorrectly formatted dialogue. And this is all in roughly about 400 or so words of a published story. 'Published story' is the keyword in that sentence; this type of thing shouldn't be happening. The writing also jumped around a lot, making it hard to keep up and understand. Two irrelevant subjects would be addressed in the same sentence, and the paragraphing was off. I'd read a little about subject #1, but before I could fully understand what was going on, the story would jump to subject #2, then suddenly to subject #3, and before I could understand that, we'd be back to subject #1 again, and so on. The dialogue was also one of the major issues. The author really needs to sit down and read her dialogue out loud to herself. It it sounds normal, the she should go out and interact with more people. Frankly, no one speaks like they do in BOUND anymore.<br /><br />The characters were just as frustrating as the grammar errors were. Real life people don't have labels. You can't look at some brooding hot guy and say 'Oh, that dude's a bad boy.' You can't assume all best friends only talk about boys and clothes, and that everyone who acts suspicious or mysterious are actually hiding something. Moreover, you can't expect then to just stick to that label. People have quirks and different personalities. It's what makes someone a person, and not a doll or a cardboard cutout. Unfortunately, that's what the characters in BOUND were like - cardboard cutouts and dolls.<br /><br />One of the things that annoy me the most in YA fiction, especially in YA romance, is that all authors somehow feel like they have to write stories in which their main characters are golden, naive, modest little goody-two-shoes. They'll be girls that look in the mirror and see nothing special; they'll be girls that envy others (most commonly their best friend) for the flawless looks they wish they could have. And I'm fine with that part. But the infuriating part is when they keep putting themselves down when people tell them that they're gorgeous, and when she catches the hot, mysterious guy's eye, she'll constantly wonder 'why me?' And that's what Arelia LaRue's like, not to mention the fact that she's supposedly the only one strong enough to save the world, fix the balance in nature, and become a great voodoo queen, etcetera etcetera etcetera.<br /><br />Sabrina's silly, boy-obsessed, and foolish - the complete opposite of Arelie. The only thing they have in common? I have an urge to slap them both - to knock some sense into them. While Arelia's portrayed as little miss goody-two-shoes, Sabrina's portrayed as the slut; the whore; thefemale player, if you will. Right after she first catches sight of Lucus LaPlante, she immediately starts flinging herself at her and non-so-subtly flirting. Has she no shame?<br /><br />Then there's Lucus. He's the - you guessed it - 'bad boy' love interest. He's your typical arrogant male love interest: self-confident, 'smoking hot,' mysterious, and showers compliment after compliment on people. Yet even through the eyes of Arelia, I see no charm in him whatsoever. What makes him more attractive and charming than any other guy in this book? I have no idea.<br /><br />The plot and overall flow of the story too was awkward, and did nothing to redeem BOUND. An example of this is when Ms. Mae reveals her 'big secret' at the beginning of chapter two. And, okay, this might have helped a little with the plot. But the dialogue in that scene was so stilted - so awkward. It reminded me of Star Wars (\""Luke, I am your father.\""). But it doesn't just stop there. Ms. Mae goes on to say-<br /><br />\""So one day your grand-mere was at work and I was watching you...\""<br /><br />First of all, that sentence is a run-on. And second, uh... stalker, anyone? \""I was watching you...\"" Then, of course, she goes on to explain everything about Arelia's 'gift' in detail, and attempts to disguise huge chunks of info-dumping text in Ms. Mae's mini-speech. The author tries to make this scene more believable by constantly reminding the reader that Ms. Mae was giving Arelia a whole lot of information at once, and so Arelia has a lot of questions to ask. Yet she accepts this whole bizarre story in a few sentences - half a page, give or take.<br /><br />And the romance. Oh, gah, the romance. It goes something like this: girl meets boy in an embarrassing situation. Girl's friend throws herself at boy. Girl is repulsed, and hates boy. Girl goes on raging about boy, and eventually falls in luuuurve with boy. They encounter tiny little obstacles but it's all good because they have each other. The end. When Lucas and Arelia met, all traces of a great paranormal story flew out the window and the rest of the book was all about them. And if you're a fan of that sort of thing, then you'll absolutely love BOUND. And over half of all the YA PR stories out there.<br /><br />BOUND just wasn't the story for me. It was riddled with grammar errors, had poor characterization, a weak plot, and a romance that swallowed what could've been a brilliant idea. I'm not going to read PUNISHED (Arelia LaRue #2). I don't think I have the patience to go through another 55,000 or so words of the same thing.

If the game registers the room as complete, there's no telling which room you left the item in and when you need the item, you can't proceed in the game if you can't find it.  Even if you go to the room you think it's in, the help button will only tell you \""there's nothing more to do here\""<br /><br />2) In the nursery, you have to screw in the handle holders on the wardrobe. If you accidentally double tap when inserting a screw, you have just inserted 2 screws into 1 hole.  There is no getting it out.

Okay, what the heck was that all about?  Next we see Hercules (Steve Reeves, who was the best of all the actors playing Hercules in the 1950's and 1960's), Ulysses (Gabriele Antonini), and Iole (Sylva Koscina) arriving on land as they journey home to Thebes.  Shortly thereafter the trio encounters Antaeus (Primo Carnera), a half-god giant who appears to enjoy either killing people or snacking on them.  Antaeus is another moment of confusion because other than being a pausing point in the movie, Antaeus does not appear again.  I suppose you could argue that the encounter with Antaeus shows that Hercules is lazy, thus what happens later might be in Hercules' character; or not.<br /><br />Soon Hercules encounters his old friend King Oedipus of Thebes, except the king is hiding out in a cave with one of his obnoxious sons trying to get the king's help in making his brother keep his promise to relinquish the throne.  Now the story gets complicated.  Hercules does convince the other brother to turn the throne over, but soon Thebes is threatened and Hercules volunteers to go on a diplomatic mission to make peace.  Unfortunately, Hercules drinks the waters of forgetfulness and ends up on an extended dalliance with Queen Oomphale of Lidia, forgetting completely that he was recently married.  On the other hand, Queen Oomphale is beautiful and maybe Hercules had an incentive to forget his young and beautiful wife, Iole.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back in Thebes, things are starting to look grim for Iole.  The brother who is the king of Thebes (I kept losing track of which brother was which) threatens to kill Iole.  Next, the other brother has allied himself with another kingdom and the leader of that army has the hots for Iole.<br /><br />In the meantime, Ulysses, clever lad that he is, rescues Hercules just about the time that Laertes, Ulysses father, and a group of other men land on the island en route to perform the diplomatic mission that Hercules was supposed to perform.  They were also hoping to find Hercules and Ulysses in the process.  After a rousing round of action, they manage to escape the island and head back to Thebes.<br /><br />Back in Thebes things get really exciting.  The brother in Thebes threw a bunch of Iole's kinfolk off the city wall, which did them little good, and threatens to kill Iole the moment Hercules shows up.  Hercules and company sneak into Thebes about the time that the two brothers duke it out in a duel, ultimately killing each other.  Then the army outside Thebes attacks, beginning a very good battle scene that impressed me.<br /><br />After having watched several other Hercules movies, I found this one much better in general.

The game has intense action, well blended in-play combinations, and in depth dialogue true to the series.  If you have not played the early games (1 and 2) then you may be in for a rough ride as there are more depressing scenes than if you imported a character (in some situations, the imported character produces a happy ending to some side stories), and as the chatter has brought forth, the very end is disappointing.  This being said, I still play the game regularly sans the last bit.<br /><br />Why I cannot recommend this game is because of Origin.  The server can be difficult to connect to, the customer service responses that I have read in answer to other gamers is substandard, and without Origin you cannot play your game.  To add clarity, you can play without the server if you purchase no bells and whistles, but considering some of the add-ons are free, once you play with the add-ons you will not be allowed to continue if the server is down.<br /><br />I would also be wary of purchasing any other game requiring Origin.

(Bringing Down the Sky),"Edit: First time, posting a review on amazon, was not aware I couldn't post urls. I have created a comment in response to the review, you can find the links there.<br /><br />I originally bought Mass Effect on Xbox 360, but before Mass Effect 3 came out, my Xbox died. Since then I've moved on to playing it on PC. I've also purchased a copy of ME1 & ME2 on Xbox for a friend, so basically I've bought ME1 & ME 2 three times haha. I've loved Mass Effect ever since the first one came out so having them now on PC gives me another reason to play through them again. This is my favorite franchise of all time. The story is amazing, the characters are incredibly well written; it just feels like a real world. Also it's pretty awesome seeing your story continue through ME2 and ME3. I've poured countless hours into these games and I've had a great time doing it even with my issues with the ending of ME3, which I still recommend to anyone. I might do a review on that one later but for now, I want to let everyone how to get their Bringing Down the Sky DLC for Mass Effect 1.<br /><br />Some might not know this but before EA bought Bioware, you could go to the Mass Effect site, register Mass Effect 1 and get a key for a free download of the DLC Bringing Down the Sky, the DLC that introduced the Batarians to the Mass Effect universe. Unfortunately, you can't register the game anymore because the sites have changed and the original Bioware accounts have been turned into EA/Origin accounts. However, fret not! you can still find patch 1.01 & 1.02 at this address [...] and you can download Bringing Down the Sky at [...]. The thing is that in order to install the DLC you need a key. You can contact EA support and ask them to provide you with a key or you can do what I did. After searching on google for a bit I found a very helpful thread on the BSN forums(Bioware Social Network) [...] with some instructions on how to install the DLC. You can use one of several universal codes they have listed to authenticate it when you attempt to install the DLC.<br /><br />Also there is a way to fix the crash error you get when you use the launcher to start the game, well, it worked for me at least.<br />* Download and install patch 1.01 while the game is closed.<br />* Download and install patch 1.02 while the game is closed.<br />* Download Bringing Down the Sky and install it with the game closed. When the window asking for the key appears, enter one of the keys listed on the bioware thread I mentioned before. (I personally used 7YVD-LCTT-CS7M-E9LM-YATC. Either do that, or contact EA support and ask them for a key.)<br />* Right on the Mass Effect shortcut in your desktop and choose Run as Administrator. (I'm running Windows 7 - 64 bit btw)<br /><br />If you do all that , then hopefully, the launcher won't crash when you click Play. If that still doesn't work, then you can do what others have mentioned in their reviews. (Right click on the Mass Effect shortcut, click, \""Open File Location\"", go to \""Binaries\"" folder and locate MassEffect.exe and use that to open the game directly, you will be able to change your graphical settings on the menu screen.)",2012-03-29,587,extra_long,2012-03,games

DRM is killing pc gaming,"This is the first Civ game I have ever played.  I have always been a strategy lover but mostly stuck with the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, and I heard a lot of good things about this game, so I decided to purchase, despite all the negative reviews.<br /><br />Pros<br />Great graphics, especially with DX 11.<br />I enjoy the hexagonal tiles compared to the traditional square, staggered columns I've been accustomed to.<br />The music is not the same for each nation.  One of the best gaming soundtracks ever.  Asian nations has its own set of music, Europe, and so forth, so it's not repetitive.  The soundtrack has several hundred scores, so you can play for a couple hours and not recognize the same song.  The soundtrack might be better than the game itself.<br />I like the idea of wonders, but I'm surprised they didn't put Solomon's temple or the Ark of the Covenant.<br /><br />Cons<br />2K really crapped on the customers by not listening to complaints.  I won't buy another Civ game.<br />I had a PowerColor 6870 x2 dual card when I first bought this which lead to constant over heating and crashing.  There is no frame cap in the game, so the cards continue to run as hard and hot as they can, which leads to crashing.  This is the same problem Star Craft 2 had when it first came out.  I recently upgraded to a GTX 680, and using Evga Precision I set the max FPS to 45.  Bingo, problem solved in that department.  It's a shame I had to upgrade my card just to keep it from overheating.<br />Corrupted save files have been a nuisance.  I could play 75 or 300 turns and all of a suden I go to play my game and the save files are corrupted.  Starting over after several hours is not my idea of a great game.<br />Sometimes the game won't start.  It crashes before the intro happens.<br />The more saved files you have, the longer it takes to load.  If I have one game going using Japan, then I have another saved game with another nation, then the saved files become extremely large and take a massive time to load.  It's best to have one saved game.  Limit the auto saved to about 75 turns.  The more you save the larger the files become.<br />It's best to delete the save files before starting a new game, and/or only have one or two auto saves at the most.  Go to your saved games folder and keep the amount of saved files to a minimum.  It cuts down on the loading time.<br />Whoever designed the wokers need to be slapped.  Once your nation gets large, and you are at war, it's like the workers become mindless.  It's convenient to put the workers on automated, but they have no problem going into an enemy nation and getting captured.  Instead of going around a nation I'm at war with, the workers will stroll right through the territory like we're allies, and get captured.  I've lost scores of workers to this.  Maybe the workers have no common sense bcuz the designers of the game are lacking in this area.<br />I wish I didn't have to click my mouse an hundred times just to skip the opening movie.  How annoying.<br /><br />Other<br />I have an AMD x4 at 3900 mhz, GTX 680, 512gb SSD Crucial M4, and 24gb ram (12gb Ramdisk), and as powerful as my system is, it still lags when it comes to loading games.  If I play 40 turns, then save and quit, when I load up a game it might take 10 seconds, but after several hundred turns the time can take over minute just to load.  Especially with an SSD the loading time is absolutely unacceptable. I can imagine it would take several times longer on an HDD.<br />Once I downloaded a crack version online which didn't require internet connection or forced updates, then the game ran smoother.<br />I buy most of my games from Steam, but I don't game with it.  Most of my games I got 75% off with steam, but out of the 30 games I have with them, the only game I actually play online is Black Ops.  Just like this game, after I buy a game, I download the cracked version.<br />As much as it sucks that this is with Steam, at least it's not with Games for Windows Lives.  That's 10 times worse.<br />DRM is killing pc gaming.  Cracked versions are more stable, work much better, and you don't have to have a constant internet connection.<br />I can't compare it to other Civ titles, but with all the plagues I've experience, I won't buy another Civ.

Though it was a bit predictable at times and a little slow in the beginning, the novel had me rooting for the heroine in the end. Fans of literary or historical fiction will probably really enjoy this novel, since the book covers everything from the role of women in the 50's to the start of McDonald's. I don't usually read this genre, but it was a pretty good read.<br /><br />THE DETAILS<br />So when Wooten sent me an ARC of Leftovers, I have to admit that I wasn't expecting a novel for adults. My last and only read of his was Wise Bear William: A New Beginning, which for some reason had me thinking that this would be another children's book.<br /><br />....nooooooooo.<br /><br />Leftovers is about picking yourself up by your bootstraps when absolutely everything in your life has crumbled to bits. It's a real success story, complete with cuss words and near-death experiences. Even though I wasn't ready for that, I still enjoyed the read.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is literary/contemporary fiction (depending on your camp and branding style, either term applies). I'm a fan of wizardry and magic and full moons, so this isn't my usual read. I think I didn't enjoy it as much as the book really deserved because of that. So keep that in mind as you read through the review.<br /><br />Hmm. That came out more ominously than I intended.<br /><br />The story itself was inspiring. I was rooting for Vivian, and each time she grew as a person, I smiled. There are a lot of lessons here, and a lot of good morals.<br /><br />That said, it was a bit cookie cutter in parts. I don't want to give anything away, but the ending was pretty much what I expected would happen. (Spoiler: It was a very neat bow. I used to be of the \""I want a perfectly trimmed ending\"" camp, but that has changed in recent years. Still, it was by no means bad...just predictable.) That might be a staple of this genre; I don't know.<br /><br />The story often wandered into what *I* thought were excessive details about clothing or hairstyles. Maybe I'm the odd chick out, but I couldn't care less what characters are wearing most of the time. I barely care what I'm wearing, though. I mean, you want to know that they're wearing clothes, but I didn't need that level of detail. Other people might love that.<br /><br />The story is written in 3rd person omniscient. At first, I thought it would follow the vein of Terry Pratchett's Mort, and while it did settle out towards the end, it was a bit confusing and shaky at first. The scenes would sometimes switch between characters without a real break or indication of a change, and I had to reread passages a few times in the beginning to figure out what was going on and where I was.<br /><br />For instance, there's one moment where two characters are talking on the phone. In this scene, we switch between characters within just a couple of paragraphs, learning of their environments and background conversations without a momentary pause in between. That kicked me from the narrative because, with the omniscience, I actually lost track of where I was completely.<br /><br />Wooten's narrative becomes smoother as the book goes on, though, so either he polished it out or I got used to it. Either way, I stopped thinking about it a third of the way through.<br /><br />I won't make any comment on editing because Wooten told me that he was still polishing the final draft of the novel while I was reading my ARC.<br /><br />All in all, I think you'll enjoy Leftovers if you read a lot of literary or historical fiction, or if you have an affinity for the fifties. It's a real story about not giving up, and I like rooting for the underdog.; I don't know.<br /><br />The story often wandered into what *I* thought were excessive details about clothing or hairstyles.

The game developers are bribing players with diamonds (item mall currency) to write good reviews here, with the \""best\"" reviewer getting rewarded with 1000 diamonds, which would cost you over $30 of real money.<br /><br />If you want some real information about this game:  It is one of many \""Free\"" to Play MMO\""RTS\"" clones that have been popping up all over the internet lately.  It is pretty standard in this regard, with a few main differences from some of the other games out there.<br /><br />1) PvP - It practically doesn't exist.  Maybe this is a positive aspect for you or a negative aspect.  If you are the type of player that likes this genre of game but doesn't particularly like some of the PvP mechanics in other games, then this game offers a welcome reprieve from those stressful situations.  For example in other games you might have to worry about a much stronger player wiping out your army that took months to build, or stealing all your resources.  In SLO, players can attack your city but there are very little consequences for winning or losing.<br /><br />The PvP arena where players fight for honor is basically just reserved for the strongest player at any given level, as you have to pay diamonds (money) to enter the arena and if anyone beats you they take your diamonds.<br /><br />Capital fights - where players battle for control of bonus resources for their team - are mostly meaningless and rarely happen, because team sizes are large enough that every single player in a region can join one team and players have a strong incentive to join the winning team.<br /><br />2) PvE - combat is not interactive, so unless you particularly enjoy watching poorly animated sprites duke it out by throwing their swords across the field this is definitely not the strength of the game either.  Game progression is almost completely linear, has no discernible or coherent story, and is full of some of the worst examples of Engrish I have seen in a game.  The one (sort of) fun aspect of PvE that I believe is unique to this game is the Zero Hour legion battles, where groups of up to 20 players must fight against waves of enemy forces for a chance of getting a rare item.  This is where most of the socialization of the game takes place.<br /><br />3) Items - Through the early and mid game drop rates and item variety is reasonable, but as the game progresses it becomes apparent that there are severe problems with itemization.  Drop rates on many end game items are extremely low (as low as 0.1%), and with constantly increasing attack cooldowns and no easy way to skip through lengthy Zero Hour battles, it can take days or weeks of farming just to get 1 item drop.  Item variety is also lacking, with many item sets lacking required pieces, or the pieces for those sets drop long after you might ever need them.<br /><br />4) Town Building - This is one thing the game gets right, unlike many games in the genre you do not have to wait years and spend tons of resources to level up all your buildings to the max level, and then wait additional years for those investments to pay off.  It takes a while, but there is an end goal in sight and it is possible to get there eventually.<br /><br />5) Item Mall/Diamonds - Extremely poor rate of return on your investment of money in this game, and often you are forced to gamble with your investment.  Some of the best items and enchantments can only be obtained by spending a LOT of money or through blind luck.  You can buy these items from other players with diamonds through the auction house, but the value of a good item could run you anywhere from $100 to $1000 worth of diamonds or even more.  Keep in mind that this is 1 item that you equip in 1 of 10 equipment slots on 1 of 5 heroes.  So basically, for the mathematically inept, you could easily spend the equivalent of a down-payment on a new home getting all the best equipment in the game.<br /><br/>6) Addictiveness - I do NOT recommend this game if you are a gambling addict, if you don't have a level head the game can lure you in and get you hooked and spending lots of money to get absolutely nothing in return.  The business model for this game seems to be designed with this type of player in mind.  So consider this your fair warning.<br /><br />So who do I recommend this game for?  If you are patient and you play a little bit each day you can continue to progress in this game and do not too badly, so it is an ok game for free players.  The lack of serious PvP means you don't have to worry too much if there are a lot of players stronger than you are.  You also don't have to worry about getting attacked while you are offline, so you won't lose sleep worrying about this game.  It is a decently fun browser game and can be worth your time if you don't take it too seriously.  Also if you are a gambling addict and you have a ton of money you were planning to throw away or burn anyways, why not do it for the chance at getting some shiny purple pixels - I'm sure the developers will thank you for supporting their game.",2012-08-30,943,extra_long,2012-08,games

If it is an autobiography; a memoir in this case the character of the author cannot be ignored. Almost from the beginning this man tells us he lives with a woman for a year, marries her, has a child with her and she spends five years helping him build a boat. Then with little explanation he ships her and his son off to live with relatives. In the next chapter he's off on his grand adventure with a German boy and a young English girl with whom he has enjoyable sex. When she leaves, he seduces a teenage girl. At this point the English girl might well say, \""This bloke is a blighter, a bounder and a bugger!\"" If you are writing about yourself as this man does the reader must consider that character does count, and it was at this point that I almost deleted the book. I'm glad I didn't. I am a sailor and this man's descriptions of ocean sailing are accurate, intriguing and beautifully depicted.<br />His explorations of the South Pacific are also well described for the period in which he explored that area. He doesn't miss a chance to blind side America with a cheap shot, which is odd from one who comes from South Africa, but he's quick to take advantage of the inexpensive and readily available provisions the American ports provide. And in the end, he decides that since Hawaii is a U.S. state, maybe America isn't so bad even though (he says) that Hawaiians hate it. (If I'm not mistaken, Hawaii campaigned a LONG time to become the 50th state.)<br />Perhaps I am a prude. Maybe it is the custom in South Africa; possibly world-wide morals have reached a new low - but in my neighborhood men in their thirties having sex with teen age girls is not considered good form.<br />Later in the book he does make a long and self-serving penance to his ex-wife, but we all know why she left him and took the child. Past performance is a good predictor of future actions. He was obviously a neglectful, alcoholic, womanizing husband. More than enough reason for her decision. And he continues this pattern all through his travels on the sea. He professes to love his child but he comes off as a selfish person who takes from everyone but gives back very little of himself.

One day the young SS soldier vaguely comments that the smell coming from the nearby Chimneys are Jews burning. Else is sickened by this admission and confronts her husband.

US,40955995,R22SPIZ3BY0YT8,B0052YFO2S,572070203,Red Faction Armageddon,Digital_Video_Games,4,0,0,False,False,A great ending to a troubled series,"The Good: Great visuals, gripping story and characters, rebuilding and destroying is really fun, lots of unique weapons, constant intense action, vehicle sections are a blast<br /><br />The Bad: Little enemy variety, a little linear for the type of game play, no one playing online, just repetitive overall<br /><br />The Red Faction series has been very rocky since the first game released in 1998. Guerrilla revolutionized the series with a massive destruction engine that allowed you to destroy anything standing. Armageddon builds on this, but gives us new characters and a whole new enemy to fight, but this time under the surface of Mars. Darius Mason is the great great grandson of Alec Mason. You get a job to excavate some sort of artifact and awaken a whole race of Martian creatures. The story is pretty riveting and takes you on a wild ride on finally beating the Marauders as well as a long ancestral war. The characters are likable and are fleshed out really well especially between Darius and his AI SAM that guides him through the game. Their bantering will some times make you laugh with some pretty witty dialog.<br /><br />The heart of the game is the combat. The game isn't an open world like last time, but a guided linear adventure that is actually more suited for the series. You can destroy anything in your path by using a large explosion or the magnet gun. Shoot at one point then link it to another and it will drag and pull apart anything in its path. You can even do this to enemies which is kind of amusing. The hammer is back, but pretty much useless since you are overwhelmed by a ton of enemies most of the time. The new arsenal kicks ass with some pretty sweet weapons. The nano rifle returns and disintegrates anything in its path. There's a black hole launcher that sucks anything nearby up and then explodes. Of course there are the usual weapons like rifles, rocket launchers, and shotguns of various types, but the new weapons are very unique.<br /><br />Most of the time you are blowing up various creatures of different sizes, but the game encourages finding strategies for each alien. This requires swapping out weapons all the time and finding which ones work in certain situations. You will come across points where you have to destroy spawn points, large tentacles, and behemoth aliens. It's challenging, but just enough to where you can actually finish the game without dying constantly. You always feel like you're on the run and never safe for a second. The objectives vary and there are some really awesome vehicle sections in the game.<br /><br />Using the walkers is awesome with certain sections slapping different weapons on the walkers as well as the spaceship section. These parts don't last long, but you always look forward to them thanks to great controls and the feeling of finally being able to over power the alien threat. You can upgrade yourself by finding scrap metal and there are a lot of upgrades. These range from health, weapon power, and your nano burst. The nano burst allows you to push enemies away, create a shield, and even make a shockwave to get out of tight situations.<br /><br />One of the most unusual parts of Armageddon is being able to rebuild things you destroyed. You can rebuild anything that was blasted away and most of the objectives require using this to repair things. This can also be used in combat by rebuilding cover that broke away, so you get a ton of things at your disposal for combat. I never really got bored with the game because the action was constant and there are so many variables for combat. If I had to choose something bad about the combat I would say some of the environments are a little cramped, and there are times where you feel the enemies will just never stop coming. There is also little in variety besides the few levels with humans, but 90% of the time you will be fighting the same aliens over and over again.<br /><br />Multiplayer is fun, but won't last long due to the lack of people playing. There is a Ruin Mode which lets you just destroy things and a few other modes to let you continue using the awesome things Armageddon lets you have, so there is some replayability here. The visuals use DirectX10 and 11 if you can run it which adds a great visual quality over the consoles and DX9. I'm not sure why it uses 10 and 11, but the game does look pretty good in most areas. Overall Armageddon is the best (and sadly the last) Red Faction game so enjoy it while you can and get destroying!f people playing.

This pack is not at all complete and REQUIRES Origin. The keys do not work on Steam.,"NOTE: This is the review of the ORIGIN version of this pack, my opinion of KoA is actually much better, however this pack is not \""complete\"", and requires spyware like software to enjoy. With that out of the way, on to the review:<br /><br />Why Amazon doesn't mention that this game requires Origin anywhere on the web page is beyond my understanding. Had I known about that piece of garbageware being included with this game, I would have never purchased the pack.<br />  --- EDIT: Now Origin is listed as the DRM. If you look at my attached screenshot, you will see that this was not always the case. Oh well, at least Amazon fixed it.<br /><br />On the other hand I am glad that (sarcasm here) Origin imported a bunch of my Steam games into itself... I am also very glad that it did all of this WITHOUT my permission or knowledge.<br /><br />Long story short and before I go on a rant here, stay away from this pack unless you don't mind dealing with Origin (which is REQUIRED) to play it, nor do you care about the missing \""Weapons & Armor Bundle\"" (which adds about 30 new pieces of gear).<br /><br />The story and gameplay here are outstanding, and I would be willing to go as far as saying the world created is on par with that of Skyrim. The two included expansion packs also give you a lot of bang for your buck, making this a fairly nice package for the current $11.99 price.<br /><br />However, now that I beat the game (and included DLC), the game (and Origin) are being removed from my hard drive - never to be re-installed again.<br /><br />My only non Origin related complaint about this pack (other than the missing DLC), is that while it starts out grand and exciting (the story really is phenomenal), within 30 hours or so your character is practically invulnerable, and completing the rest of the game (DLC included) is literally a breeze.<br /><br />My main complaint about Origin is that it is a spyware infested pile of junk, and this is even stated in their EULA. Had this gamenot required Origin to play, I would have scored it a 4/5 as I really did enjoy the majority of my time with it.<br /><br />Snippet of the Origin EULA below:<br />----------<br />2.

Being that I'm on the West Coast, that meant access to the game at 9pm March 5. I excited clicked refresh on the authentication page to allow me to unlock my copy so I could just into the comfortable boots of Nathan Shepard, a character that had been cultivated through numerous play throughs of Mass Effect 1 and 2. Here's my review.<br /><br />Mechanics: (5/5) The gameplay mechanics essentially feel just like Mass Effect 2. The thermal clip system is still in place, and the powers still have the same activation mechanic. Everything is essentially the same, except the melee is tweaked a bit more to give it an important feel, making a Vanguard a juggernaut<br /><br />Customization: (5/5) Here I'm taking about the guns/armor. Another big plus, guns have accessories you can add that change weight, fire power, clip capacity, melee damage, etc. Weapon choices are no longer restricted by class but by weight. The more weight you carry, the longer your abilities take to refresh, making for interesting personal preferences. Armor sets as well as custom sets add a nice touch<br /><br />Length: (3/5) Its a bit short, with me playing through the full game with all missions completed in about 27 hours. Kinda feels like Bioware removed about 30% of the game for DLC, which kinda sucks, but hey, whatever.<br /><br />Story: (-5/5)Here's where this game earns its 1 star rating.... Everything else aside,I'd rate it 5/5. Without spoilers, this will be hard to explain, but I'll try. You basically spend the entire game like you did every other: Assembling a team, talking to them, making hard choices, and going in for an epic battle. And where the 27 hours of game play leading to the final scene were absolutely, jaw dropping awesome, the final scene itself is a giant Deus Ex Machina, offering terrible choices regardless of anything else you've done in the other two games or in the third leading up to that. It flips the underlying narrative on its head and offers a ham fisted reason for the Reapers motivations and your final outcomes. It made me sick to watch, because I had expected so very much from this game that to see it end like this was (sadly in so many ways) one of the most disappointing moments of my life. I love good stories, I love great action games, and this was supposed to be both, and ME1 and 2 were, but this..... The ending basically makes every decision you made leading up to that point, through ME1, ME2,and ME3 pointless, because you either screw over everyone, screw over everyone and commit genocide (not saying against who), or screw over everyone (yes, there's a theme there). It makes you feel as though everything you did previously didn't mean anything other than change who appears in the cutscenes. It makes your companions sacrifices meaningless. It makes your actions just window dressing, like \""Oh hey, there's that ship I saved in the final battle scene.\""<br /><br />In closing, if the neuralizer from Men in Black was real, not only would I want my money back from Bioware, I would demand that my knowledge of the ending of ME3 be permanently erased from my mind. I've been a long supporter of Bioware, even supporting Dragon Age II, but I should have headed the warning from the fans of that story that Bioware could screw up ME3. Unless Bioware rewrites the ending scene to not only remove the totally backwards events (like people magically appearing in a ship when they should have been with you, and why were they in the relay when they were seconds earlier in battle) and the options in the end, I'm not going to buy the DLC. The only DLC I'll even look at is an ending change. Damn you Bioware, damn you....<br /><br />Also, there's a poll on the Bioware Social Network with 30k+ votes (over 89%) demanding new endings, just to clarify",2012-03-13,704,extra_long,2012-03,games

What you get is a strange mix of two genres with a really horrible marketing scheme.<br /><br />First, the marketing. You may have heard the #1 marketing item about this game. It's main character was modeled by and voice-acted by a pornography actress. Why did they market that? She is a very pretty girl, but a very horrible voice-actor. And since this is a game built for 13 and up, it's rather inappropriate to make mention of her dubious past. Don't worry, there's no nudity in the game (as far as I've seen).<br /><br />Now, the strange mix of genres:<br /><br />Turn-Based Combat Fantasy RPG:<br />This game has an older style of turn-based combat. It's a bit similar to some old Final Fantasy games. Most of the combat is plain attack-attack-attck. But as you progress, the combat is actually very strategic. It's really in the strategic combat that the game gets its best flavor.<br /><br />The fantasy is typical cliche type stuff that you'll find filling the gaming libraries of the 80's and 90's. And the story is pretty basic, but not terribly annoying.<br /><br />RPG elements are almost all flawed. The characters are flat. The voice acting is rotten. The visuals are hit-and-miss. The music is annoying. It makes you eat and drink copious amounts to stay alive. If it's a bad idea in an RPG, it's probably found here.<br /><br />Economy Sim:<br />Each town has its own economy and inter-town trade affects the economy. So you'll spend a lot, if not most, of your time going from town to town buying and selling goods to buy things. You can make a bit of money from questing and other typical RPG-type activities, but not much. So you'll probably end up as a trader who carries tiny amounts of goods from place to place.<br /><br />The economy sim aspect of the game ruins it. It's a neat addition, but it takes real work to trade. And who wants to work when you're playing a game?<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Here's the strange kicker of it all:  you actually might enjoy some of this game. There's enough fun in the game to actually have fun. There's tons of other games that are more fun, but if you really want to try this game out, you'll probably at least have a few good hours with it before quitting. And if you suffer through some more of it, there's a pleasantly cliche story that unwraps for you.<br /><br />What's great about GODS is that it employs some of the traditions in old-school RPGs that are just not around today. And it's a little nice to revisit some of those, if not to remember why most have let them be forgotten.game. There's enough fun in the game to actually have fun.

I used to love Flo Rida, his first two albums were great, and Only One Flo Pt. 1 was mediocre, but this was just sad. Flo has always been mainstream, but he has sold out so much it's worse than Pitbull, and that's saying something.<br /><br />1. Whistle 4/5 I'll admit, this is a really catchy song. It's got a great guitar riff and a catchy hook. My biggest gripe with this song is that the lyrics are absolutely awful. \""Blow my whistle\""? REALLY? I wonder what your whistle could be... Give me a break.<br /><br />2. Wild Ones 1/5 This song is absolutely painful. It's a generic pop/rap/dance track with one of the most cringe-inducing hooks I have ever heard. \""Hey I heard you were a wild one, ooooooooohhhhhhooooooooo\"" I've tried to get through it, I just can't do it. One of the worst songs to get popular in a long, long time.<br /><br />3. Let It Roll 3/5 It's catchy, but I really don't see any difference between this song, Wild Ones, Good Feeling, Sweet Spot, and I Cry. It's one that just gets lost in all the other crappy pop/rap/dance tracks on this album.<br /><br />4. Good Feeling 4/5 The lead single. It was actually quite good when it was first released. But here's the deal, there's a song by a guy that goes by Avicii (or something like that) that released a track before this that was pretty much this song. Flo Rida hijacked that song, rapped to it and it somehow peaked at number 2 or 3 on billboard. Now that was an exaggeration, but still, be original.<br /><br />5. In My Mind Pt. 2 2/5 This is one of the few tracks that almost sounds different on this album... but not quite. It's another crappy track that you'll probably skip. (Not like I care, but why do you have to buy the entire album to get this song?)<br /><br />6. Sweet Spot 1/5 The only track worse than Wild Ones. J-Lo's hook sounds like something coming out of an X-rated Disney channel show. It's unoriginal, it's annoying, but ultimately it just makes you want to stick a gun in your mouth. Flo does nothing to save this track, and to top it all off, it sounds a lot like every other track on this CD.<br /><br />7. Thinking of You 3/5 Sigghhh, this song does not fit this album at all. It's not a bad song at all, but with every other song on the album sounding like some pathetic attempt at getting at the radio, this was just confusing. Listening to this song with the rest of the album is like talking to Buzz Killington at the worst party ever. If he would have put this on one of his previous albums it could of been a decent filler track. On this album, it's just stupid.<br /><br />8. I Cry 3/5 Wait, didn't I just listen to this song two, four, five, and six tracks ago?<br /><br />9. Run 4/5 Wait, Flo Rida is now LMFAO? I'm confused. One of the better tracks off the album though, it sounds like a song that could have been on \""Sorry for Party Rocking\"" by LMFAO. This is just like throwing a random LMFAO track at the end of a terrible partying album. It's a step sideways for the album.<br /><br />Closing Remarks: This by no means is a troll review. I bought this album with my own money. Do I regret it? Yes. I loved Flo Rida (key word being \""loved\""), but this is a sad attempt at being an album that you'd play at an awesome party. My biggest complaint with this album is the fact that every song sound almost exactly the same. I think Flo Rida really likes the Copy/Paste buttons.<br /><br />FINAL SCORE: 3.5/10 (Not an average)",2012-09-26,650,extra_long,2012-09,music

There are no options: all or nothing!<br />3:  I then again logged on to UBiSoft to dowload the V.1.4 Patch.  It tells you that you are now installing the full newly updated game, a lot more than a simple patch I guess.  So after the download, I click on the Install Button and immediately it popped up saying, \""You MUST have an older version on this computer to install this update.\"" and then terminated.<br />4: Either way you lose!  It will not work with or without an installed program...... don't you just love this stuff??  You know?

I will keep you posted.<br />6: Lastly: There is NO manual nor help with ship's torpedo settings nor anything but the internal short hold the curser over it info box.  It is in many ways similar to the older sub sims, but it is NOT the same - it can be quite confusing.  Oh well, documentation if often a problem, right?  This has NONE!<br /><br />So, I will reinstall and try to make the game work without patches, see how it does.  You know?  After all of this hassle, UBiSoft has had 5 years since this patch was issued!  You would really think that by now, they would actually have fixed the patch to work seemlessly, right?  That is why I gave it 2 stars only..... not for the game but for the foolishness.  I do hope that it will be a lot of fun...... assuming it even works.  :-)  More on this later:<br />Gary<br /><br />UPDATE:  If you use the V1.3 that they are selling to you here, it will work... most the time.

That, as a 'concept', worked fairly well (being generous) on Eat Me, Drink Me... but it has proven exceedingly taxing, and is as someone scraping the bottom of a literal well, for the last 2 albums, HEOL & BV. --- I don't give half a crap what 'concept' he goes with, and never have... but it seems like HE does, because he's needed to re-create himself, image, etc., with every new album, starting with AntiChrist SuperStar in '96, giving him the needed focus & \""theme\"", on which to derive inspiration & so on... Obviously, the last 3 albums, starting w/ EM,DM - the 'concept' has been shedding all those other 'concepts' and just being \""Marilyn Manson, the person\""... and what we've learned... there's nothing much truly interestingabout that person... and I'm really not sure if he even exists anymore, having changed & recreated himself so many times previously -- leaving a figurative empty shell who only knows drugs, sex, and excesses there of.<br /><br />It's particularly telling, that he's now taking \""The Cure\"" idea, and doing in full, 3 shows per city, 1 album in full, each night, of his most popular, AntiChrist, Animals, & Holywood......<br />-- I am not a \""Mansonite\"" and sparsely listen to the band that much anymore, having, unlike him it seems, grown up a bit & expanded my musical tastes (for the better)... but my favorite album, is perhaps a tie, between Antichrist Superstar & The Golden Age of Grotesque (which many, many hated & loathed, for reasons I still don't fully understand; but, to each his own).....<br />--- The point to this point is this... I like any Manson material that is Good, and I DO have many tracks from Eat Me Drink Me, and even a few from The High End of Low, in my music library.... but \""Born Villain\"" shows the artist, (disappointingly) continuing his musical down-slide; and it's truly, and literally, agonizing to hear... and again, this is the worst yet.  He even did a pathetic & horrid job of the \""cover song\"", which for whatever reason, features Johnny Depp (WTF!?) on guitar, \""You're So Vain\"" (by Carly Simon). __ Absolutely the worst cover song he's ever done -- not because I don't like the original song to begin with... but, well, you'll see for yourself if you listen to it -- worst cover he's ever done.<br /><br />I've listened to the album 3 times now - wanting to give my initial response some separation and wait a few days before the next listen, to see if it was just an overreaction... but no.  From start to end, my feelings, are that most of this album is absolutely unremarkable, with NO, (ZERO) \""Hits\"", with only 3 or 4 songs that are worth contemplating, \""To delete, or not to delete\"". ___ Even out of those 3 or 4, (and as with most every song on the album),I will have to physically edit each track I do decide to keep, so I don't have to listen to the annoying, 30+ seconds of stupid, ridiculous, non-song-serving, \""ambient-noise intros\""... which I don't get, at all -- they serve no purpose, they don't go with the song or music of the song... it's like, self-serving aggrandizement, that proclaims with each track, \""Here's a new part of my genius... soak up this stupid noise first, so your brain can acclimate & prepare itself to hear my sonic-genius, which is this song...\""<br /><br />PS: Also, the music itself, is absolutely terrible. Even with Twiggy being back in the band & writing much of the music... the Manson band has been taken apart & reassembled too many times -- to the point where nothing in this record even reminds me of the Manson-music-style, and so on.  Literally, NOTHING redeeming about this album... which makes all the pre-release hoopla, (short-film by Shia LeBoeuf & photo-book, etc.) much more understandable -- as he knew he had to do everything possible to hype-the-hell out of this album, because most of the sales would undoubtedly come as PRE-ORDERS ONLY -- because once word got out how truly awful it was, people would download it rather than buy it (and would soon there after, delete it as well). ___ Manson, The Man/Person, has lost his identity it would seem; and all that's left is \""woe is me, I'm heart-broken, drunk, on drugs, and I want love\""... because that's been the only theme/concept noticeable of the last 3 albums... and it's really, really, getting old... and even he can't think of a good song to write about it anymore... which is truly sad, because even though I don't listen to Manson songs/albums all that much anymore... it still pains me to hear what's happened to one of my past, favorite bands.<br /><br />PPS: Most everyone giving this 4 or 5 Stars, likely ARE \""Mansonites\"", who will shout from the mountaintops, how awesome everything this man (or band) does... you know, they're the peoplein his VHS & DVD releases, who cut \""Marilyn Manson\"" into their chests with razor blades... who got tattoos of Manson's face, logo, or whatever... Those are Mansonites... and you cannot take their reviews seriously, as they are not at all objective, in the slightest. ___ That's not to say, everyone who isn't a Mansonite will hate this album... just, 90% or so, will. ___ So, if you see the words \""genius\"", \""evolution\"", & so on... yeah, those are Mansonites. ___ If anything, this album is proof of DEvolution, &/or lack of \""genius\""... not an example of an \""evolved sound\"" &/or \""genius writing\"".  Cheers.  __  A Manson album which shows ACTUAL (good) musical-evolution, would be Mechanical Animals, Golden Age of Grotesque; and a somewhat-good anti-evolution, in Eat Me Drink Me... but this, is continued devolution, which has gone on too long, and is now a shadow, without a reflection (haha) of it's former self.<br />____________________________<br /><br />\""Best songs\"": No Reflection / Murderers Are Getting Prettier Every Day<br />\""Decent songs\"": Slo-Mo-Tion / Children of Cain / Born Villain / Breaking the Same Old Ground<br />-- Most everyone will agree & like the 2 \""Best songs\"".<br />-- Most Manson fans will like (to a degree) the \""Decent songs\""... but because they're largely forgettable (in addition to what I said earlier), may wrestle on whether to keep or delete some, or all of them.<br />-- The rest of the 8 songs, I (and many) consider to be complete garbage & will be deleted.",2012-05-08,1292,extra_long,2012-05,music

I went into this movie expecting a phenomenal film and what I got was the conclusion to a trilogy that I can only compare to the likes of Lord of the Rings (LOTR) and the original 3 Star Wars (SW). Although, not even reletively similar in how the movies play (compared to LOTR and SW), the dark knight trilogy is one of the best 3 trilogies of all time. I consider the 3rd Godfather reason enough to put the Godfather trilogy 4th by a considerable margin compared to the three I just referenced. In terms of all three movies being one complete story, The best trilogy(s) of all time are as followed:<br /><br />1) Lord of the Rings<br />2) Batman/Dark Knight (Nolan)<br />3) Star War's<br />4) Godfather<br />5) Bourne, Indiana Jones, Terminaor, pirates, etc... (most are more than a trilogy now).<br /><br />Obviously, the above list is exponentially subjective but I feel as it accurately depicts at least by a rough estimate, the top choices for any individual to  create their own list, and in their own order.<br /><br />Anyway's The Dark Knight Rises (TDKR) is such a must-see film, I won't get into any detail whatsoever about any of the movie. Based on my favorite movies, you can decide if your taste is like mine at all; then make the determination on whether you want to see TDKR. I am not a great critic, as I found zero flaw's in the movie but I do love movies... a lot. So basically, I like all Leonardo movies after titanic, Christopher Nolan is the favorite Director (due to Memento, Inception, The Prestige). I am also a huge Martin Scorsese fan (obviously, every movie he's ever done btw) and David Fincher as well (Fight Club, Dragon Tattoo, The Game, Social Network, Seven, and many, many more) I like the Iron Man movies more than every other superhero movie besides TDKR. Big time Shawshank fan, huge The Town fan, loved Enemy of the State (and most of Will Smith's stuff). I like QuentonTarantino and think his upcoming Danjo Unchained is going to be awesome. Not a huge Matrix fan which is strange with my other movie preferences. Obviously the whole Hanibal Lector series, I'm a big fan of Green Street Hooligans, big fan of Robert DeNiro and most of the stuff he's been in too. I am a comedy fan but more a fan of a bad*** movie like TDKR. To give a more specific preference, I give The Departed the nod for my favorite movie of all-time. TDKR is up there, - top 10. I actually put both, The Dark Knight (TDK) and TDKR in my top 10 movies ever made. Only other movie series on that kind of level is The Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is my first review of a movie... ever. So I essesntially just listed my preferences for a good movie, and TDKR certainly fits that mold.  I highly reccommend TDKR to anyone, but certainly someone who has taste for any of the forementioned films on my &#34;preference list&#34;. Well, I don't know if this will help you but I gave it my best shot. If you read this, good for you... now you know what kind of movie's I like and got a good reccommendation for a great film. If you stopped reading after the first few sentences, also great... move on, do big things, im outta hereeeeee. watch TDKR!!!!!!!!",2012-12-07,590,extra_long,2012-12,videos

Made for the simplistic play of a console rig PC gamers need not apply, though the developers tried to include some pc aspects like half hearted keyboard commands, of which a large percentage are unbindable.Without going into detail this game was made primarily for the console crowd and to keep a very long rant short, PC users simply need not apply.<br /><br />Tera gets it's combat action note from Chronicles of Spellborn, roughly the third mainstream MMO to try this combat mechanic, and it worked very well, sadly poor marketing and lack of knowledge killed Chronicles of Spellborn and Tera has grabbed the mechanics and ideas straight from that games playbook, including armor and weapon glyphs. tera has not created anything new, nor improved the playstyle. people that played Chronicles of Spellborne will reckognize the style immeadiately. Dodging....sometimes it works, sometimes it did not.<br /><br />Graphics are passible, not 2012 quality or what they should be but passable, more like 4 years and change old. Some of the choices in visuals will make you wince, like the tranlucent cubes animation when something is appearing/transitioning in, it just looks cheap. This is because the game was made for the limitations of a console graphics system and does not come close to taxing even a low level gaming system with a decent graphics card.<br /><br />Movement and combat is made for a controller, as a few reviewrs have stated, you WILL NOT get any enjoyment out of this title unless you utilize a controller....since everything in this game was built around them. Keyboard/mouse folks, forget about it.<br /><br />The gameplay is uninspired and the same as the very first MMO,s out there, ultima and ruby, absolutely nothing new or innovative. Infact you will be waiting in line to complete quests or killstealing to get your quests done. On the good side the starter areas are dead as a dirty outhouse and quests can be completed in peace.<br /><br />Playtstyle is group only mechanics. This is not to say you cant solo somewhat but you will not get anything comparable to group loot. a solo Gamer need not apply as they will never reach the forced group mecanics this game espouses, another non choice game. It continues to baffle me why devs choose this rout instead of letting groups naturally migrate together like people meeting in a club or bar or event, this forced grouping mechanic for the sake of some people standing on a soapbox claiming an MMO is made for socializing and not solo players is asnine thought. Gamers should have choice, not labels used by children, and certainly not have the devs make mechanics that support this tired, childish way of thinking. Tera is all about forced socializing, and if you do not, you will not be going anywhere. The soupmakers have won in this regards.<br /><br />Overall. if you want something new to play and want a break from the other MMO's you play Tera will fit the bill for a couple of weeks and then you will scramble back to your old favorites as Tera is entirely forgettable. Tera IS NOT worth a monthly sub, this is a microtransaction game model as it is not good enough for a monthly fee or box sale model. it should be a free download with the store.<br /><br />T/A throughout, the male subculture will thouroughly enjoy the visuals, minus the chicken running.<br /><br />I was able to get my money back from this purchase, the only thing i can do is warn you. it is your dollar, spend it the way you want.",2012-05-11,619,extra_long,2012-05,games

I've never really cared for this sub genre but I feel as though I'm coming around a bit here. His heavy tech style seems to at times, come at the expense of melody. Namely in tracks such as \""Safari\"", and \""Alba\"" which had this uplifting feel that's now missing. While on the other hand his picks and mixes charge previously released tracks with a different harder energy. For example he ends disc 1 with Anjunabeats 09's intro/warmup tracks \""Afterthought\"" and \""Median\"". The sublime warmth that these tracks have is replaced with nervous tension and drive. Not necessarily for the worse though, as they are interesting takes however I'm not completely sold. One of the low points for me was \""No More Serious Faces\"". I skip it every single time.<br /><br />Disc 2 by Nitrous Oxide is more my speed. A little more trance with less of a hard edge. Its just a good solid mix, with nothing to outstanding except for \""Human Turbines\"" and maybe \""Contrast\"". I was expecting a little more euphoria in this mix. It doesn't really feel like Oxide's usual.<br /><br />Overall both CDs are kind of disappointing. Both cds are marred by:<br /><br />1. So-so track selection - Almost half of the tracks appeared very recently on other Anjuna CDs. With the original mixes usually being better(Constrast, In and Out, Progress). This is the 3rd time for \""Electrify\"" and it finally gotten a bit listenable;).<br /><br />2. Weak mixing - Odd transitions (Awakening to Tiburon, Helion to Nautica) and too many volume splashes track to track.<br /><br />3. Too much tech - Genre preferences aside I expect a little diversity in Worldwide releases. The awesome 01 and 02 sounded worldly. This is trendy. And I do like some tech house just not all the time.<br /><br />Go the MP3 route and grab the tracks you like and piece-meal it.

When most gamers here this name they think of one of the best video game characters ever made. Ezio went down in-game history the way he did for a reason. Assassin's Creed revolutionized the action/adventure genre with assassination skills, and a whole new take on stealth gameplay, plus awesome parkour gameplay. Revelations is the conclusion to Altair and Ezio's story, but just another chapter for Desmond Miles. Desmond is stuck in the blackness of the Animus and is in kind of a coma. His brain can't tell his personality apart from Ezio and Altair's, so Subject 16 (yes you finally meet him), helps you a little bit here. There isn't much of Desmond here because this is the two assassin's story, in fact there is only three cut-aways to Desmond through the whole game.<br /><br />Ezio's story starts with him trying to find 5 keys that Altair hid, but the Templars are also after them. Altair has some secret hidden library under Masyaf, so it's a race. This is the shortest AC game to date, but that doesn't mean it's worse. There is a new layer added to Ezio's personality because he's 50 through 62 in this game. Playing as an old man is pretty awesome though. Ezio is now wiser, smarter, and a master assassin. You even play as Altair through his old age up to 92 and he still kicks ass! This should be more like Geriatrics's Creed. Let's go ahead and start with side missions. The same one's from Brotherhood are kept, but others from past games are cut. Templar Dens replace Borgia Towers, you can recruit assassins, buy stores, buy monuments, find view points, and that's about it. Side missions took a back seat here to some epic main story missions. Overall the game can be beaten in less than 15 hours even if you try to do the side missions that are here.<br /><br />Collectibles this time around involve only Animus Fragments which are used to unlock crappy Desmond side stories which will be explained later. Two new combat abilities are brought to the table here and that is bomb making and the hookblade. This adds a layer of depth to combat and climbing. Remember when you would jump off a building from too high and just can't reach the one in front of you? Now you can with a quick press of the action button and you can catch yourself. It can be used in combat as well as running away from guards. Remember when guards would block your path and you had no choice but to get knocked over? Now you can hook them and roll right over their back. This also adds another item to climbing which are ziplines. Zip along and assassinate enemies at high-speed which is a blast.<br /><br />Bombs have three different levels, diversions, weapons, and defense. Boxes are scattered everywhere that contain parts of bombs which contain the container, gun powder type, and item inside. You can use a lamb's blood bomb to make enemies think they're wounded and become stunned. A splinter bomb stuns enemies, or use a cherry bomb to drive guards away from areas. These really come in handy when you don't want to get into a huge fight. The problem here is that it's wasted on the short length of the story. I didn't even get to use all the bomb types because there just weren't enough missions in the game that called for them.<br /><br />There is also a strange strategy type section in the beginning that is never used anywhere in the game and I thought it was fun.

Howard's, the man behind \""Conan the Barbarian\"" and \""Solomon Kane.\"" In this book, Jesus has risen from the dead, he's got a sword, and he's pissed off. Arrayed against him are the armies of Rome, supernatural creatures banished from Creation who have an axe to grind with God's son, and a bunch of scheming wizards and witches.<br /><br />In terms of world-building, it's a lot of fun. Seeing some Genesis-era monsters show up is a kick, and the supernatural system here (which features the screaming head of John the Baptist) is pulpy and original. The story is relatively short, and it moves fast, and its style is pretty much a dead-on imitation of Howard, so if Robert E. Howard is your thing you'll love this. For me, personally, the imitation is a little too good, and while the author duplicates the sword-swinging, brawny thrills of Howard, he also brings in Howard's tendency to purple prose and long scene descriptions. But that's just me - Howard is, after all, one of the most popular writers of the 20th Century.<br /><br />But while the story delivers on a pure pulp level, I found that for me the subject matter left me scratching my head. I find myself wondering if the author is a serious Christian who is trying to preach to a new audience, or if this is a send-up with an agenda, or if he's just a guy who likes to write pulp fiction and he's created a brand new world, like Howard's Cimmeria, fashioned out of Biblical trappings?

Rather it's the album under Dave's name  simply entitled \""At Storyville 1954.\""  The original LP and most subsequent editions have a black and white cover.  The audio is easily superior to that of the pictured album as is the program.  When Dave expressed his fondness of the recording to Marian McPartland (during one of the most absorbing hours of [[ASIN:B00008J2UL Marian McPartland's Piano Jazz]] that I've ever heard), it's his performance on \""Over the Rainbow\"" that receives special attention.  (\""When You're Smiling\"" is another highlight of the original Storyville disc, which has eight or more tracks, which are \""lo fi\"" but none with the \""wow\"" (pitch fluctuations) present on this butchered \""sea green\"" edition.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />Some of the most creative, imaginative and even fiery playing by both Paul Desmond and Dave Brubeck can be heard on their early albums--primarily on Fantasy and Columbia--before the legendary, iconic \""Time Out\"" album.  In the '50s they defied enormous odds by playing sophisticated and adventurous, non-compromising music before receptive college audiences and, occasionally, in small night clubs.  In fact, \""The Dave Brubeck Quartet at Oberlin\"" (Fantasy) may be their best work on record providing one can overlook the absence of bassist Eugene Wright and drummer Joe Morello.  The point is that great jazz does not necessarily require a collection of superior musicians: a group of \""listening\"" musicians, all working toward a common goal, is more often the catalyst for the exciting, emotive and memorable moments of improvising musicians playing at their peak.  On \""Live at Oberlin\"" and \""At the College of the Pacific\"" Paul can be heard playing with more heat and fire than at any time in his career while inserting quotations ranging from pop tunes to Stravinsky and Prokofief (to the audible delight of his listeners).  Moreover, several of the group's early Columbia albums--\""Jazz Goes to College,\"" \""Brubeck Time,\"" \""Jazz: Red, Hot and Cool\"" can be recommended just as warmly.  Dave Brubeck was one of three jazz musicians (Ellington and Monk were the other two) to appear on the cover of \""Time\"" Magazine--all due to the public attention the quartet had attracted BEFORE \""Time Out\"" and the incorporation of Gene Wright and Joe Morello in the group.<br /><br />The above is merely a way of saying: save yourself two bucks and 60 minutes of wasted time.  There's far better early Brubeck. This truncated edition of \""Brubeck at Storyville '54,\"" with audio that's inferior to the inferior audio of the original album, does a serious disservice, imo, to the playing of the mid-50s quartet.  (I'm afraid the same must be said about the recent release of a live 1968 Bill Evans Trio set.  Despite the premium price and the multiple editions (one in vinyl), the  the sound of the piano itself is badly distorted while the mix, or lack of it, manages to make the Trio sound like a train wreck!)  In the case of this curious Amazon \""bargain\"" the audio is not merely non-professional: it's simply unacceptable. The frequencies practically eliminate the rhythm section while pinching the sound of Paul's alto (it sounds like a clarinet through many stretches) and subjecting both the horn and Brubeck's piano to \""WOW\"" (irregular rotation and pitch fluctuation).<br /><br />Contrary to much received critical opinion, this early quartet could \""swing\""--but only when Paul and Dave were sufficiently in synch and inspired to make swing happen--and when the audio was at least capable of documenting the event (as it is on most other editions of the Quartet's 1954 Storyville stand).om pop tunes to Stravinsky and Prokofief (to the audible delight of his listeners).

US,28385793,R1DP26JQ1DYHH,B0086213XW,637145848,Take This Waltz,Digital_Video_Download,2,17,24,False,False,Frustrating and immature,"Enter Margot (Michelle Williams); saying Margot has a lot of quirks is an understatement. Margot is downright flawed. She's very peculiar with not only the things she likes, but in everything she does. She's afraid of the thought of being afraid; those in-between moments in life. The events that kick off those moments and their conclusions don't phase her one way or the other, but what bridges together those moments is the most terrifying thing in the world to Margot. While traveling, Margot meets Daniel (Luke Kirby); a private painter who makes his living pulling a rickshaw around town. There's chemistry between Margot and Daniel right from the start, but Margot is married to a chef named Lou (Seth Rogen) so things are obviously a little complicated. There's this simultaneous unstoppable chain of events that transpires as Margot gets closer and closer to Daniel, but she feels her marriage to Lou crumbling in the process. It's an in-between moment that Margot has lost all control over.<br /><br />This is the most frustrating movie of the year; hands down. It's nearly two hours of characters being pulled in directions they don't want to go and playing tug of war with their emotions when things could easily be resolved with a few simple actions. For a movie whose screenplay was included in The Black List a few years ago, the final result is a huge letdown. The dialogue is downright atrocious at times. Margot's little \""gaylord\"" speech to Daniel being the prime example, but their exchange on the airplane leaves you with a furrow in your brow. Margot says something along the lines of, \""I'm afraid of being afraid,\"" after confessing her fears to Daniel to which Daniel replies, \""That sounds like the most dangerous thing in the world.\"" Really? Because like seven hundred other things come to mind that are way more dangerous.<br /><br />The three main characters leave you with the urge to lobotomize yourself. Margot can't make a decision to save her life and when she finally does she regrets not staying on the path she was already on. Lou is seriously a contender of the most childish excuse of an adult to grace the silver screen. The immature jokes between him and Margot make you want to projectile vomit on newborn puppies and the two of them have the worst pillow talk you could possibly imagine. Daniel is the most interesting of the three, but only because he acts so cryptic and tries so hard to be this enigma. You remember that scene in \""Family Guy\"" where Stewie mocks people who think they're photography majors because they took a black and white picture of a lawn chair? That's kind of the way Daniel is with painting.<br /><br />The entire movie can be summed up in four actions; cooking, sleeping, being immature, and cheating on your husband. The end. Cue \""Video Killed the Radio Star.\"" Thirty minutes in and you're ready for every character to s**t or get off the pot. \""Take This Waltz\"" also includes a shower scene with about a dozen women you wish you never saw naked. After seeing it, you'll be convinced that the only reason Sarah Silverman joined the cast was to get naked on screen and brag about how hot she looks.<br /><br />\""Take This Waltz\"" tries to take advantage of this preconceived notion that you already love this movie even though you haven't seen it yet. It tries so hard to be cute and cuddly and emotional and it winds up being massively annoying in the process. \""Here's some actors you may have enjoyed in other things along with some humor you won't find funny and a horrid screenplay that we insist on cramming down your throat. Oh and people cry a lot, so you better do that too.\""<br /><br />It will be a damn miracle if you can finish \""Take This Waltz,\"" but if you do you'll have to fight every urge to run off into the night, scream at the top of your lungs, and tell every couple within a six block radius to just end it now and screw the first person they come into contact with because that'll be quicker and easier than pretending to love each other and wasting everyone's time for an undetermined amount of years.

I was unable to get past the fourth chapter.  There was very little description and a tremendous amount of dialogue.  And, the dialogue is totally inane.  It reminds me of a 4 year old attempting to tell their parents everything that happened at preschool today.  One thing is piled on top of another within the conversation.  People who have just met tell each other everything we learned about their characters and their relations in the entire book Pride and Prejudice, I assume so that there will be no misunderstandings.  It is just amazing to hear Lady Catherine tell Elizabeth everything about Mr. Darcy, Georgiana, and Wickham without practically taking a breath.  And, when asked her opinion of Darcy by Lady Catherine, Elizabeth immediately tells her all of her impressions of the man.  When Elizabeth is introduced for the first time to Colonel Fitzwilliam in Darcy's presence, the three of them discuss the entirety of the situation with Jane and Bingley and Miss Bingley's deception.  And, overhearing this conversation, Lady Catherine devises a scheme to matchmake Jane and Bingley at Rosings.<br />Some of the situations are also odd.  Immediately after Lady Catherine introduces Darcy, Georgiana and Fitzwilliam to Elizabeth, Darcy asks if he can introduce his sister to Elizabeth - I suppose in order to use the exact wording from P&P?  A fair amount of information tells us Sir Lucas is only able to stay one night after arriving at Hunsford, but this does not appear to be a plot device, simply unnecessary information and action.  Anne De Bourgh has conveniently been eliminated from the storyline - again, to eliminate any tension between Darcy and Elizabeth, I guess?<br />The descriptions of the characters are minimal, leaving them sounding exceptionally bland. Either that or it must be assumed we know them from having already read about them in other books.  For example, Mr. Bennet makes a disparaging remark about Elizabeth going earlier to Hunsford and having to spend more time with Mr. Collins.  But, there is nothing in THIS book describing Mr. Collins to lead us to understand this would be a hardship.  Since the point of this story is to have Lady Catherine be the opposite of the person we have met in P&P, her character and appearance are described.  Colonel Fitzwilliam, on the other hand, is not described at all.  Georgiana is described as a \""beautiful blonde\"", who is holding her brother's hand, rather than describing Darcy as holding the hand of the unknown blonde - yet to be introduced as his sister.<br />All in all, you have to suspend a tremendous amount of belief to follow this story and to buy into these characters.going earlier to Hunsford and having to spend more time with Mr. Collins.

That said, don't let that keep you from watching Iron Man 2.  It's a good movie in its own right.  In Iron Man 2, the world knows that Tony Stark is Iron Man, yet it isn't satisfied.  The U.S. Government wants Stark to give them the technology to the Iron Man suit.  S.H.I.E.L.D. is keeping a close eye on Stark, and Stark Industries is facing new problems brought on by Tony's irresponsibility, culminating with a late-night party while wearing the Iron Man suit.  Stark is slowly being poisoned by the very arc reactor that is also keeping him alive.  How Stark deals with it is what makes this movie so interesting.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. suits his role perfectly.  His Tony Stark is egotistical and narcissistic, but still has a playful sense of humor and a powerful desire to do good in the world.  These qualities don't often go together, but Downey brings them all to Stark in a believable way.  I'd pay to watch an entire movie of him sitting by himself--he's that good.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow reprises her role of Pepper Potts, who's a dedicated, hard-working woman trying to manage both Tony and his company, but slowly being driven mad by the stress of it.<br /><br />Don Cheadle steps into the role of Lt. Col. Rhodes, and it isn't one of Cheadle's best.  Terrence Howard played a perfect Rhodes in the first movie--dedicated to the military, but also to his friend Tony, forever putting up with his shenanigans--even standing at attention for three hours on Tony's aircraft.  In this movie, Cheadle just doesn't seem believable as a military man.  In the Congressional hearing, both the Senators and Stark just overpower him verbally, and there just isn't the same level of playful banter between Downey and Cheadle as there was between Downey and Howard.  (No \""Spring Break 1987\"" jokes here.)<br /><br />Overall, Iron Man 2 is very much worth watching.  It's just not as good as the first.",2012-05-19,345,long,2012-05,videos

Vic Morrow's characterization is creepy for its honesty and how it bleeds into rebel characters we see today. Glenn Ford is great, as is the supporting cast.

Installation hangs at the \""Update may take several minutes\"" screen.  No progress bar seen updating.  After 40 minutes and still apparently not updated, I had to stop the installer from running.<br /><br />Clicked on the Quicken 2013 icon, Quicken started and converted my 2012 data file.  When Quicken reopened, it was running version 1.  When I went to update, it prompted me to register.  Registration hangs and does not occur, preventing me from updating to R10.<br /><br />Major fail on Intuit's part.  Uninstalled Quicken 2013 via Control Panel uninstall, deleted converted 2013 data file, restored 2012 data file and reinstalled Quicken 2012.<br /><br />Q2012 working perfectly.  Updated to R7 without a hitch.  Everything back to where it was.

The morons in India who support and produce this product should all be fired.nd a memory hog.<br /><br />My scheduled transactions from the Home screen all appeared different.  Clicking on 90 days instead of 30 days visible kept the cursor at 90 days, so when I scrolled, it switched between the different scheduled options, rather than scrolling up and down in the scheduled transactions list.  The only way I could unhighlight that field was to go to the select accounts field.  Are you kidding me?<br /><br />Of course, the scheduled transaction list appeared differently.  It only shows one iteration of a payment, rather than each identical payment for each if there are multiple payments to the same payee in a month.<br /><br />Went to my toolbar, where I have 5 or 6 memorized reports on the bar.  These are reports I use each and every day.  Of course, the report names were all there, but nothing happened when I clicked on any of them.  So I assumed I would have to recreate each and every report on the toolbar again if I wanted to use them.  I didn't even attempt to open any of the many memorized reports I had.  I figured all those wouldn't open either.<br /><br />I gave up.  I really don't have the time nor the initiative to mess around with recreating reports and graphs that I have diligently set up over the many years of using Quicken.  I uninstalled Quicken 2013, reinstalled Quicken 2011 and copied my data file which I religiously backup daily back to my Quicken data file.  No harm, no foul except a waste of my time.<br /><br />Personally, I have had it with Quicken.  It's software is still the gold standard when it comes to personal financial software...when it works.  But 10 revisions in less than a few months (and this is NOT the first year version to have the same sort of problems year in and year out) is unacceptable.  Beta testing should have weeded out ALL these problems.  Paid users should not be beta testers for Intuit.<br /><br />And the yearly revisions are nothing but window dressing, at best.  Improvements are usually downgrades and make the software worse.  Entry times are horrendous.  The software offers nothing new except mobile app sync, which I heard doesn't work either.<br /><br />I am downloading MoneyDance for a free trial. For one much lower fee, you get a more straight forward version than Quicken, free upgrades, a platform that uses the same data file whether you are using a PC or a Mac version (a real plus), and free app sync to your Android, iPhone or iPad.  I know the change will not be a straight path from Quicken to MD, but I really feel that in the not too distant future when Quicken 2011 is sunsetted it will be time to finally find another personal finance software that listens to it's users.",2012-12-31,670,extra_long,2012-12,software

I know there was no choice really in the season opener with the departures of the other actors but the dynamic chemistry of the original cast and their dealings with other characters was what kept me glued to the show and propelled me last year to watch two seasons back to back in three days and anxiously grab each 3rd season show as it became available on amazon.  I am not that invested anymore I wish I was there are so few things I do watch lately. Once I forget how great I thought this show began and I can get over the character losses ( I think I could understand more an actor change than all the character shuffling so quickly) then I will take another stab. But for now the season opener episode will be a lone digital download of season 4. I'm just not even interested in this vampire war premise the way it has evolved so quickly in that it is almost just too campy of a storyline. It isn't so much about \""being human \"" anymore as it is grief, death, occasional humor all in this nutty war concept where the villains take themselves too seriously to even be scary enough when suspending disbelief as a viewer. Turner's Mitchell was more frightening at times when he struggled with hunger or anger. I guess I was spoiled. Again...I mean to take nothing from those acting currently they are great and I wish nothing but the best success for the actors who moved on......but the draw that I felt to this show and the unique concepts it posed just isn't there for me.

Worse, \""community manager\"" Minea says nothing when multiple people have complained about this.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Take a few minutes to read the forums there and you will quickly find out that the game is FILLED WITH JERKS who are out to ruin your precious playtime.  There are people who log in for the SOLE PURPOSE of griefing low level characters and they happen often.<br /><br />Example: There is an outpost near level 20 area where you are to kill basilisks that is VERY far away and these high level players will sit and wait for low level characters to return to turn in quest and one shot kill them.  Then you respawn VERY far away and have to go all the way back to...guess what...get killed again.  Problem is...you can't advance storyline without turning in that quest so YOU ARE STUCK until the jerk decides to go away.  En Masse Entertainment is well aware of this particular problem but have done NOTHING to fix this.  The \""community\"" calls this behavior \""PvP\"".

There is no incentive to spend time extracting, gathering or GULP...buying materials at way over inflated prices and grinding your Alchemy etc just to have a random drop ALWAYS outdo you.<br /><br />5. COMBAT:<br />Yes, as a PRO, there is no lock on targeting requiring the barest minimal skill to simply chase targets around.  Fun for about a day or two but then guess what?  You will find out almost every single monster has the SAME fight algorithm from level 1-60 and you are back to classic button mashing.<br /><br />6.

For example, as of today's writing, the \""LFD\"" / looking for dungeon tool for the ONLY level 35-40 dungeon is BROKEN.  You hit accept to join and it CANCELS you out.<br /><br />7. GEAR SNOBS:<br />At high level dungeons you can wait OVER AN HOUR to get in from the looking for dungeon tool only to be immediately kicked by group leader (usually a Lancer class) because they<br />a) don't like your class e.g. Beserkers and Warriors have a VERY hard time getting into high level dungeons because of this<br />b) If you don't have the \""right\"" high tier gear you can get kicked from these snobs...problem is, if you don't run the high level dungeons in the first place...you CAN'T EVER GET THE GEAR unless you pay hopelessly expensive prices on the auction house.<br />c) Once you're kicked you can't get back in for 20 minutes because the system puts you on \""cooldown\""<br />Straight from the Tera forums:<br />[...]<br /><br />8. NO END GAME CONTENT:<br />Why is this even an issue?  Because you can level a character from level 1-60 (top level) in less than 2 weeks...then guess what...there is NOTHING TO DO.  Yeah you can run the same dungeons over and over until your eyes bleed, but you will easily tire of it.

I went in and corrected it, and my federal income tax changed - but the state remained the same.

As you fill out your federal form and make changes it keeps updating all the forms. Are you telling me the software can't handle this for the state form either?

It made my six-year-old self actually sit still for an hour and a half.<br />I think the first reason was the characters. The title character, played by Mike Myers, is funny and although he is not a nice person at the beginning (being a stereotypical ogre), everyone likes him. A scene in the middle of the movie makes us feel sorry for him, in fact. \""People take one look at me and go 'Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre.' They judge me before they even know me.\""<br />Later, the line about judging is echoed back to Shrek by the film's female lead, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz). Although she begins as a typical fairytale princess, she proves independent, fearless and skilled. She turns out to be the perfect match for Shrek.<br />The villain, the dwarf Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is also very funny. He's snobby, superficial, and overall just cruel.<br />But I think the credit should really go to Eddie Murphy, who plays the role of Shrek's sidekick, Donkey. He was probably the first person to befriend Shrek, who at first finds him annoying, but becomes quite friendly with him. Nearly every joke makes me laugh every time, especially when Donkey freaks out because Shrek got shot by an arrow. \""Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt?! Oh no, Shrek's gonna die!\""<br />The jokes, as I said, are hilarious, and the storyline is perfect. It's a parody of a fairytale, and works extremely well. Out of the four Shrek movies, this is probably the second best, close behind the second movie. I strongly advise you to buy it.",2012-03-15,275,long,2012-03,videos

This author excelled throughout the story detailing gruesome fights and scenes of torture.<br /><br />Now remember, this is erotica, so a majority of time is spent on sex.  And there was plenty of sex for Serena.  She seemed to be driven mostly by her libido, which was a shame because I would have loved to see more character development.  Though told in first person, I never really got into her head.  I don't feel like I know enough about her, except she likes sex.  A lot.  The sex scenes were steamy, and got really hot when Alex came into the picture.  Serena is a little too perfect, in all she has no less than 5 \""men\"" interested in her.<br /><br />I really liked how this author drew the relationship between Serena and her father.  Daddy showed his affection through material things, never truly connecting with his daughter.  Her whole life, all Serena tried to do was please the man.  When he was happy, she got a fancy sports car.  It was a very sad relationship that felt very real.  I like the concessions made at the end between the two, but really liked that the author didn't make it all candy and roses.  Familial relationships aren't easy and take a long time to mend when broken.  In the end there is some healing, but it isn't fixed.<br /><br />The other main men in Serena's life, Alex and Nick, were polar opposites, yet I could see the attraction in both.  Nick was the most absolute perfect, do-good man you could think of.  Not a bad bone in this guys body.  Alex was a douche (at times), a bad boy with a past, who works for daddy, only to complicate things.  I think Serena ended up with the right guy (though she really didn't have a choice!)  Alex was so much more interesting than Nick, simply because he had more sides to his personality.<br /><br />This was a very short book, only about 130 pages.  I would have loved to see more world development.  I had a lot of questions about the vampires of this world.  Why do they transform at age 25?  How are vampires made?  Or born?  How do they fit in so easily with the human world (Nick never had any suspicions anything was different with Serena, so these vamps must not be cold.)?  We are told they are fast, heal easily, live a long time, and can use compulsion (though we never get to see that one.)  What else can they do?  What about the vampire politics?  I wanted more about the rogue vampire group that is feeding off humans and leaving them drained and dead.  Near the end there are a few witches and a fallen angel that we meet, but I wish that for a series subtitled \""Paranormal City\"" that the origins of that world were a bit clearer.  You really could have taken out all the vampire and paranormal aspects and changed it to the mafia and have essentially the same story.  I wanted more paranormal, but I think this author is off to a great start and has great bones to this story, just expand a little.<br /><br />Another thing I liked in this book was the use of music to convey character moods and location.  A great (hot!) scene took place at a Linkin Park concert.  Depeche Mode, Muse, even LMFAO were all mentioned.  It really helped me to get into the author's head when using music as a soundtrack to the character's lives.<br /><br />Overall, a very good start to what is sure to be a promising paranormal erotica series.  While not fully developed, this book had much more characterization and plot than many erotica novels.<br /><br />While I'm by nomeans the grammar or spelling police, I did notice a lot of spelling errors, dropped letters (`he' for `her', `di' for `did') as well as incorrect words (`waist' for `waste', `your' for `you're), and run on sentences that needed commas.

The first time, I listened through the album exactly as it's presented upon purchase, with the three non-score tracks first, then the orchestral score following; I thoroughly enjoyed the vocal tracks \""Touch the Sky\"" and \""Learn Me Right\""; the \""Into the Open Air\"" is nice but didn't resonate with me personally as the others did - the \""Touch the Sky\"" is especially outstanding, of the three - just pounding with energy and emotion. I found that the three vocal tracks at the beginning convey a rather different overall mood than the score - not necessarily a bad thing, but I was initially expecting the integration of some of the themes from the vocal tracks at the beginning during the orchestral score, as has been the case with Pixar movies in the past, such as \""Up\"" and \""Ratatouille\"" which had fun vocal tracks that utilized melodic content from the main score - these first three tracks don't do that, but they are very fun to listen to, and I find the \""Touch the Sky\"" uplifting and inspiring; it leads me to want to go running through the woods and mountains, or something similar to that. On my second listen through I went and restructured the album so the three vocal tracks at the beginning were at the end of the album and the orchestral score was first. I enjoyed the score more the second time through with this play order, with the vocal tracks by Julie Fowlis and Birdy/Mumford and Sons as punctuation to the score, rather than introduction to it.<br /><br />Patrick Doyle's score has some of everything you'd expect to be associated with a movie like this: there are the exciting Scottish reels and dance-like pieces, plenty of ethnic instruments throughout that help center the feel of the music geographically, slow sweeping melodies, powerfully energetic action tracks, and a few tracks where cast members from the film sing, which are all solid offerings - whether silly, in the rowdy \""Song of Mor'du\"" or beautiful, in the gentle \""Noble Maiden Fair (A Mhaighdean Bhan Uasal)\"".<br /><br />Overall, the score has a lot more subtle moments than I expected before listening, but they play well with good melodic content and so on. There are a few tracks that seem to be the almost inevitable \""background music\"" that probably plays under quiet scenes in the movie where there isn't much going on, but there are plenty of stirring moments to be found - both on the exciting and the impassioned side of things that keep the listening enjoyable throughout the album.<br /><br />There are 15 out of the 20 tracks that are outstanding; four of the remaining five tracks are score tracks that seem to be mostly filler music, and the other track of the five non-outstanding tracks is the vocal piece \""Into the Open Air\"" that doesn't resonate well with me. All in all, there is no reason why you shouldn't purchase this whole album, as there are enough outstanding tracks to justify paying for the whole album.

I loved the opening and the set-up of the season long arcs and the introduction of new characters.<br /><br />When we left Sam and Dean at the end of Season 7, Dean was in Purgatory and Cas had just disappeared, Kevin, the new prophet had been kidnapped by the always delightful Crowley, Bobby's soul had been set free in death and Sam was left all alone to find Dean, save Kevin and fight the Leviathons. It turns out that Sam did none of those things, a character choice that is sure to be controversial but that has some roots in past behavior and plots. Dean it seems may have been a very bad boy in Purgatory, a place he nicknamed Pure, no doubt because of the purity of the intent to survive that is necessary. It seems that in Purgatory, upon the disappearance of Cas, Dean teamed with a sexy, Southern vampire named Benny. Cas is dead or close enough to it to make no difference according to Dean and this forms the first mystery. Just what did happen to Cas and how did Dean get out of Pure? The viewer gets tantalizing glimpses of Dean and Benny's time in Purgatory via flashback.<br /><br />Kevin has grown a lot in the last year mostly because necessity is the mother of invention and desperation is the father of survival. Kevin was kidnapped by Crowley and shown another tablet to translate. How he escaped Crowley and begged Sam for help is also shown in flashback.<br /><br />Women, as always fare badly in the Supernatural universe with one death and one desertion in the first episode alone, but this seems to be the norm for Supernatural. Geekboys have no idea how to write realistic women or realistic relationships with women whether romantic or platonic, they can only do fantasy wish fulfillment (Dean's overwhemlming number of notches on his belt) or idealization of dead women (mom, Jessica, Meg, Jo, etc. etc. etc, the list is far too long) but idealization of dead women was good enough for Edgar Allen Poe, arguably one of the first nerd writers of the supernatural and fantastic so I suppose the writers are in good company here.<br /><br />All in all a great set-up to the season, including the character controversy and I look forward to see where the writers are going to take it.<br /><br />One last footnote, the Leviathan, those monsters whose weakness is a Victorian bug killer, are around but don't seem like they will be a focus for the season. Supernatural fans should check this out with no worries and newbies should start with the first season and catch-up.

In fact, if you haven't already encountered those predecessors, your chances of making heads or tails of this new effort are slim.<br /><br />Other reviewers have covered the stone-faced acting of Gary Oldman, the confusing, non-responsive passages of dialog, and the dark, completely uninteresting sets and cinematography.  But the thing that wrecks this movie for me is the loss of any sense of the original story.<br /><br />The novel is a wonderful progression of character and plot that reminds me of Charles Dickens or Jane Austen.  In the book, and the BBC series, the main character arcs -- Jim Prideaux, George Smiley, Peter Guillam, Ricky Tarr -- are mixed with explorations of the supporting actors -- Percy Alleline, Toby Esterhase, Roy Bland, Bill Haydon, Connie Sachs, Jim Roach, Roddy Martindale, Oliver Lacon, Sam Collins, Russian master spy Karla/Guestmann, and especially Jerry Westerby, who becomes the hero of The Honorable Schoolboy, book two of the trilogy -- in a way that leads the reader inexorably to the uncovering of the mole.<br /><br />In the movie there is none of this depth and certainly no enjoyment.  In fact, it's as if the writers sought at every pass to remove elements that reveal the characters and their relationships.  Other reviewers blame the compression into a 2-hour movie, but that just doesn't explain it.  For instance, watching the movie only, you would never guess that Guillam is Smiley's old friend, the person he sought as a drinking companion after being dismissed as assistant head of MI6.  In the car on the way to see Lacon Peter addresses him as Mr. Smiley instead of George.  That was the first discordant note for me.  There were many, many others.<br /><br />Other strikes against the movie include:<br /><br />* Horrible, horrible casting.  While these are obviously professional actors and carry off their roles as written, compare the wonderful casting choices in the BBC series -- tough-guy Ian Bannen as Jim Prideaux, masculine-cum-sardonic Michael Jayston as Peter Guillam, Ian Richardson as supercilious, upper-crust Bill Haydon, the wonderful character actor Joss Ackland as Jerry Westerby.  And of course Alec Guinness, the most gifted actor of all time, as Smiley.<br /><br />* Unnecessary changes to the story line that add nothing, make no sense, and are ineptly done.  Perhaps combining Sam Collins with Jerry Westerby saved time, but then why dress Jerry up in a tuxedo, the way Sam would have been as ex-spy-turned-casino manager?  Never explained.  Why the shooting of Irina in front of Jim Prideaux while a prisoner in the Soviet Union?  They were completely separated in both plot and time.  Jim must have been as confused as I was.<br /><br />* Gary Oldman's portrayal of Smiley.  From movies like Dracula and The Professional we know Oldman is amazing, almost always worth watching.  Here he seems clueless as to his chosen craft.  Smiley, as written and as portrayed by Alec Guinness, was quiet, but commanding and incisive when he spoke, a pivotal character.  Oldman is just silent.<br /><br />* The complete waste of John Hurt as Control -- compare Alexander Knox in the BBC series.<br /><br />* Peter Guillam breaking up with his gay lover -- in the book he is ostentatiously heterosexual.  An obligatory nod to Hollywood's politically correct gay agenda?<br /><br />* Clumsily written scenes -- for example, Alleline's confrontation with Guillam over Tarr's reappearance in England.  Watch the BBC version to see the right way to do this, with little extra investment in time expended.<br /><br />* Poor choice of music, especially at the end.  Bewildering, in fact.<br /><br />* The MI6 office Christmas party.  Nothing remotely like that in thebook.  And why, why, why have Santa Claus in a Lenin mask and everyone happily singing along with the USSR national anthem?  Why??<br /><br />* The Americanization of the dialog by removing le Carre's use of British idiom.  If we Americans really don't know that \""sacked\"" means fired, are we incapable of figuring it out?<br /><br />* Addition of gratuitous profanity -- the s-word instead of \""chickenfeed\"" when describing the Witchcraft intelligence material that bamboozled MI6.  Connie Sachs's use of the f-word.  Not in the book and totally unnecessary.  Possibly to gain a PG-13 rating?<br /><br />* Gratuitous violence -- the shooting of Irina, Jim Prideaux using a sniper rifle instead of a karate chop at the end.  I guess American audiences just won't accept a spy movie without gunplay and gore.  I blame Sean Connery and Jason Bourne.<br /><br />(One note of praise:  At least here MI6 has a decent-sized building.  The BBC production gave the impression they were in rented offices over a failing London bookshop.)<br /><br />As this project proceeded, someone must have seen the disaster it was headed for.  I'm surprised le Carre allowed his name to be associated with the final product.  Was there a mole in the production company?<br /><br />So, read the book and watch the TV series.  If those make you a Karla fanatic the way I am, then you may want to watch this hideously deformed descendant just for closure.  Otherwise, I suggest you skip it.",2012-03-26,898,extra_long,2012-03,videos

The film was well shot, with good editing, sound, and special effects (not over the top, but used judiciously, which is rare in vey low budget, straight to video horror these days). The acting was as might be expected - stilted, and delivered by less experienced actors who have yet to get the feel for delivering their lines, for the most part (lead actor Josh Folan, for example, stood apart from the rest of the cast in delivering believable lines, as did the actor playing the Scottish show host). The real drawback to this video was the screenwriting, and this is the real Achilles' Heel. The writer (or writers) included myriad lines in this film that really stood out as just terrible screenwriting (which prove especially harmful to the actors trying to do their jobs). Many lines are painfully overdramatic and they thus pull the viewer away from the film, like a splash of cold water, and you are forced to remember you're just watching a movie - and that's the worst thing I think any screenwriter can do. Despite this, the film, by and large, is actually better than most of its kin, and worth watching once.",2012-07-11,205,long,2012-07,videos

The first two games featured nuanced plots about the balance of humanity's needs to protect itself and stand as one of many species in the galactic community, exciting and endearing characters who had unique points of view that helped drive a story of a race to save the Galaxy from an ancient and terrible force that seeks to consume all intelligent life in the galaxy.<br /><br />Mass Effect 3 seemed on track to be the Magnum Opus of this series, bringing an epic story of galactic salvation to a grand crescendo. Instead, after dozens of hours of travelling the Galaxy to bring it's people together to fight the Reapers in what promises to be on of the greatest space battles in Science Fiction history, we get a M. Knight Shyamalan-esque last minute twist ending, where the player is forced to choose between three differently colored endings.  The entire series themes of choice, freedom and unity between all forms of life are thrown away in the last ten minutes for an ending that seems to be themed around lack-of-choice, predestination and the basic assumption that organic and synthetic life cannot peacefully coexist.<br /><br />I'm sorry Bioware, but you threw away a five-star game with a zero-star ending.

Lauderdale, Florida and I've been hooked ever since. I am so glad to see that they are now on Amazon where the world can access their contribution to Christian music. They have pushed the boundaries and made a fresh new take on the genre. This is not your \""run of the mill\"" CD either. I am a very picky music buyer (I am a former musician)and these guys have made it into my heavy rotation. Pure talent!!! I bought three of these CD's months back and gave them to friends with similar discriminating music tastes. They all LOVE LOVE LOVE this CD!!<br /><br />God bless the singers and musicians involved on this showcase of talent that is dedicated to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!<br /><br />1. Soul Of Future Worship<br />The Future of Worship is finger snapping groove that captures the listener with funky instruments and guitar riffs along with the clear and crisp vocal acrobatics of the lead singer. It's a powerful opening track that clearly sets the mood for the musical experience.<br /><br />2. Covered In The Blood<br />If the soulful churchy rock anthem doesn't get you, the lyrics, phrasing and the lead singers' eclectic voice will. The fast paced beat of the drums, woodwinds and string accents keep up with the quick tempo and driving beat of the song. This track is left field but you will not be disappointed. This is a definitive  crossover track that will please the masses.<br /><br />3. What If<br />This track has a \""motown\"" feel to it. The instruments ( I keep talking about the instruments because these guys are backed by a live band and not fake studio effects......) round out this track to a nostalgic-esque feel. Im going to make a leap here and compare this to a futuristc \""Temptations\"" gospel track. It's just that good. Everything moves together. The background vocals, the lead singers, instruments and lyrics. Powerful track!!<br /><br />4. Faith<br />A laid back groove with strings, organs, sax riffs and simple drum beats effortlessly feature the refreshing mid range tones and breathy falsetto of the lead singer who seems to paint a colorful picture of the daily lives who are walking in the faith.<br /><br />5. Start Over<br />The composition takes the listners on a journey through the depths of the Christian walk. The lead singer (who seems to channel a young David Ruffin with his raspy gospel riffs) expresses his desire to make things right in his walk with God. The tone and depth of his voice and the background vocals are in perfect sync  with the instruments to comprise a melodic plea for guidance on the Christian journey.<br /><br />6. His Love<br />The opening strings paint a love story between the believer and God. The lead singer opens up with a falsetto and breathy tone that seems to capture the heartfelt trust we all have for Christ. The female vocalist elevates the story telling to newer heights. Truly a love song to be sung to Christ. Beautifully composed.<br /><br />7. Freedom Worship<br />The opening is reminiscent of a singer testifying at an old baptist church in the backwoods of Alabama. The song slips into a groove with powerful backing by the horns and driving beat from the drums.  The alto lead singer mesmerizes with his vocal acrobatics, while the second lead pushes the power of the song with his soulful raspy voice and \""churchy\"" call and answer.<br /><br />8. Got Jesus<br />There is already a video on MTV for this song (go to MTV.com and search this song and the video should come) I love how these guys push the music boundaries  for this CD. This is another mainstream hip song that I'm sure will crossover well! I GOT JESUS FOR LIFE!!!!<br /><br />9. Every Moment<br />This is a very dreamy song where the lead seems to nail the thoughts and feelings the song writer wants to express with every note and phrase. The horns give the perfect accent on this song and the background vocals are even the more superb. (It is amazing how this song sounds very Jackson-Five ish....WOW!! even the bass riff...amazing) Great to listen to during quiet times in the evenings or even in the mornings.<br /><br />10. Be Encouraged<br />No words can describe this composition. This song goes to the depths of the believers' issues and encourages with the lyrics and melody of the song. The lead does an amazing job with this track. The background vocals and the subtle \""call and answer\"" you hear adds layers and depth. This song, if you allow, can be a balm to a trying situation you are facing.<br /><br />11. Favor<br />Jazzy tune that celebrates the favor of God in lives. This is a great praise track to jam to while riding in your car (for me...riding down I-95 on sunny afternoon in South Florida). The fellas once again hit the nail on the head with this track. Everything falls into place.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this collection of songs. It is hard to not to listen to any one of these tracks on a daily basis. These young men are truly talented beyond measure and the music that they make is incredible.",2012-02-28,888,extra_long,2012-02,music

Battlefield 3 is a great online FPS. All the good things people are saying about the online gameplay, environment, graphics, etc, are all true. I play it and I enjoy it. The realism is astounding.  However, it's hard to give this game even 4 stars simply because I'm irritated every time I have to open my browser and go through this process of getting into an online match.

Can't I just start the    game for crying in the night?  - Click Next  - Tells me that it will be launching from the Web browser when I want to play. hmm.  - Click Next  - Click Next again.  - Here we go; I now have buttons to play Quick Match or Launch Campaign  - Click Launch Campaign, the browser wants to now install a browser plugin in order to play the game.

Howard wrote the original screenplay of Remember the Titans in the late 1990s. It is based on the true story of T.C. Williams High School located in Alexandria, Virginia. Though it is based on the historical story of this integrated school, a great amount of the film is fictionalized and has some inaccuracies. Even so, this film managed to capture the interest and love of many through the exaggerated drama, music and characters.<br /><br />The story begins in 1971 with the merging of a black and a white school to form the T.C Williams high school. When this happened, racial tension heightened among the citizens of Alexandria and many problems arose. However, the players on the team were more concerned with having a spot on the team.<br /><br />With the combination of the schools, Caucasian football coach Bill Yoast was forced to step down as head coach and take the position of assistant coach so that Herman Boone, an African American man could step in. While the football players disagreed for a while on this matter, the coaches were able to step up and work together well to secure the success for their team. They were able to end the prejudice and hate between the members and bring them together to win the Virginia State Championship. T.C. Williams became a role model for all those still struggling with the desegregation in high schools.<br /><br />When comparing how the film portrayed this scene to the true story, you can see that it is slightly different than what actually happened. In reality, after the Supreme Court ruled that all school systems were to be desegregated in 1963, schools in Alexandria created the K6-2-2-2 plan in order to achieve official desegregation. This created two junior high schools, George Washington and Francis Hammond and one high school, T.C. Williams High School. When this caused heightened tension, and extremely high competition in football, the school board in Virginia chose to combine the 3 schools to resolve these issues.<br /><br />Other historical inaccuracies like the one above appeared through out the film. For example, the director also chose to exaggerate the scores in the games. In the film they showed the titans trailing the Marshall team by seven points, when they actually beat Andrew Lewis 27 points to zero. It can be assumed that for the purpose of winning the audiences support of the Titans, they portrayed the Titans as the underdog in the beginning. This enables the movie to build up the storyline and have a more dramatic ending that satisfies the needs of the viewers.<br /><br />American football player Gerry Bertier was also shown to have sustained a major injury before the championship game, when it actually was not until months after the game. In the film, due to his injury and hospitalization, he was incapable of playing. Methods like this also win the hearts of the audience and allow the characters to gain their sympathy.<br /><br />Beyond the differences between what actually happened and what didn't, the music and acting played a key role in making scenes more dramatic. In the locker room, when two of the players discovered their common interest of music it evoked great emotion. They seemed like they had always been friends when singing Ain't No Mountain High Enough. It created a strong sense of happiness, and the appropriate lyrics relates directly to the central issue of segregation. The films ability to embed emotions was quite good. Along with the music, certain motions like the dancing also enforced the sense of unity and what it meant to be a single team. The film's ability to go from chaos and anger to togetherness was very strong and inspirational.<br /><br />In conclusion, the film was able to add drama and intensify the emotions of the audience greatlyby the use of music, acting and how they portrayed certain things. By the end of the movie the audience's desire for the Titans to be victorious is also very high and succeeded in passing the message of racial equality. However, while Remember the Titans was an enthralling film to watch, the historical inaccuracies and dramatization has shifted the history of the titans greatly.",2012-03-26,734,extra_long,2012-03,videos

And you should!<br /><br />After I reading it, I couldn't help but want to write a review.<br /><br />I am pleasantly surprised at the amount of rich material made available in a pdf book.In 170 pages for the ebook version.<br /><br />It has been very beneficial for me in studying God's Word and growing in Christ.<br /><br />What I like about this book is that:<br /><br />1. It is written in modern layman language. This makes it easy even for a 14 year old boy to read it.<br />Well, I am an adult. Which means for me, I can easily share the info with my friends, and even hand it to a teenager to let him/ her read it on their own without having me to coach them or explain to them anything.<br /><br />2. It has no deep theological jargon that gets in the way of understanding God's Word. I have read commentaries on the bible, and for those of us who study God's Word - we know that commentaries can be hard to read with all the complex sentences.<br /><br />3. It is full of historical, cultural and geographical info, which is easy to read and not hard to digest. It's a fairly easy read. At least I don't feel like I am reading 'Elizabethen English'.<br /><br />4. Pastor Ralph also talks of the feelings of the different charactors involved in the Abraham story, when they encounter different situations. This is extremely important, as it draws out the humanity of people whom God uses, and Pastor Ralph is by no way presumptuous. He bothers to explain himself when he makes statements. It shows that God uses people who are not super stars or celebrities; that God uses people just like you and me.I can feel the bible verses coming to life.<br /><br />5. Pastor Ralph has also taken extra steps to break down Abraham's important timeline of events into an easily readable table form - with the relevant verses.<br /><br />5. It's got different Hebrew words translated into plain English. Yes, this really helps me cos I am no deep theologian, and I have no background in Greek/ Hebrew studies. I am currently using Logos software for understanding Hebrew and Greek when I am reading a Bible passage (Logos has all the installed software dictionary for layman like me to do convenient searches). And for those of us who have struggles to learn Hebrew and Greek, the explanation that Pastor Ralph gives is easy to understand.<br /><br />I currently read the Bible with software versions of Hebrew and Greek dictionaries, and Pastor Ralph has been able to draw out the flavours and the meaning of the different Hebrew words - in their context.<br /><br />For those of us who wax exegetical - context is king.<br /><br />And of course, the various lessions broken down into questions for discussion. You can readily use it for group discussions in your churches and fellowship groups.<br /><br />6. It's got different pictures too with colour, so it won't be a dry read. No it's not just words that go on forever. The wordings are well spaced out. And this helps for those of us who want to do a scan or a quick read, or look for relevant info.<br /><br />7. There are also references to books that Pastor Ralph has read. So for those of you who are ministers who want to do follow-up reading on your own - this helps.<br /><br />8. There are relevant New Testament references and applications that are strewned throughout the book. It presents very sound doctrine and ready application for those of us who are pragmatic.<br /><br />Most of all, you will feel as though you went into a time machine, where Pastor Ralph transports you into the life and times of Abraham - with their culture, geography, political surroundings and even the circumstances that are unique to the patriarchs.<br /><br />You are going to be making alot of notes.<br /><br />And there are many other goodies too...<br /><br />This pdfbook - has saved me alot of time in researching on Abraham. I have searched high and low for info on his life and times - via the web and various commentaries. And Pastor Ralph has made this available to believers like us.<br /><br />I am based in Asia, so I got the pdf. But really, I would very much like to get the hard copy.(It takes time to ship over to Asia).<br />So for those of you who can get the book quickly, trust me...get the hard copy, and make lots of notes. This book is going to be handy for a long long time.<br /><br />Thank you Pastor Ralph for studying God's Word, for making this available to us.<br /><br />May God continue to bless Pastor Ralph and his ministry. We need you! ;-)<br /><br />My Lord be with you!",2012-06-27,850,extra_long,2012-06,ebooks

While perhaps thinking of her lover, she still has sex with other men including a vagrant living on the street and a school principal who is satisfied with just her company.<br /><br />Sada makes no secret of what she wants and where she wants it.  This leads to sadomasochism and in one dream sequence, borderline pedophilia.  Many critics hail the film as groundbreaking, powerful, impressive and so on.  I will give it credit for being groundbreaking.  It is the most graphic and explicit \""art\"" film I've ever seen.  Technically, the film is well made.  The acting is pretty good.

Yet the worst part is because its hyper fighter you cant slow down the gameplay and your only option is to lower the difficulty. Which doesn't make it less hard when enemies are always attacking and can pull of special moves so accurately. Good luck trying to get to the bosses and even Bison.

It skips along at a great rate of knots, but in the process exposes great swathes of plot holes and glaring inconsistencies. My WTF alarm was dinging from the first few pages and never stopped all the way to the end.<br /><br />Which is a shame, because Currie crafts a decent story and displays a good knowledge of miltary process and procedures. These are well integrated into his plot and characterisations, but the science fiction aspects are not as well written or, for the most part, even that sensible. Many of the situations are phenomenally contrived, to the point that the main character remarks on pretty much that point early on in the novel. So we have sci-fi as a scaffold for the fights, flights and technology with peripheral observations on what are some really interesting ideas and implications. And as with most scaffolds, the ediface underneath was incomplete.<br /><br />And that incompleteness generated disappointment for me. A reader new(ish) to sci-fi may not feel such disappointment, because it is possible to read \""Into the Black\"" at the superficial level and enjoy what is a good yarn. But if you've delved into novels where the subtleties of first contact; alien invasion; space warfare and the other themes raised in \""Into the Black\"" were explored with breadth and depth then you'll likely be as disappointed as I was by chances missed and plot items bouncing from one to the other with only tenuous relationships between them.

US,37455882,RBS1TZ9JEAF3P,B002RX5WEM,863247238,Schubert: String Quintet,Digital_Music_Purchase,2,0,1,False,False,"If you want to hear Schubert's String Quintet turned into insignificant music of little emotional impact, this is it","There have been so many oustanding versions of Schubert's Quintet in the history of recording, including many from the digital era, in all kinds of styles and approaches, from the urgent and dramatic to the spacious and lyrical, that it is interesting once in a while to hear one that is totally besides the point, e.g. the emotional content(s) of the composition, as this one. It can be found in CD form on the European sister companies under ASIN B0000262MQ (which is how I have it), but is offered here only as download. No great loss.<br /><br />It was recorded in March 1987 and, first, there is the fact that the Kocian Quartet does not play the first movement repeat - an option that was customary in the LP era until the mid-1970s, because of the time constraints of an LP side, but that practically disappeared after the mid-1980s and the first digital/CD versions of the Alban Berg Quartet (1983, [[ASIN:B000002RMP Schubert: Quintet in C, d. 956]]), the Bartok Quartet (1984, [[ASIN:B004IKU35U Schubert: String Quintet in C major, D 956 / String Quartet No. 12 in C minor, D 703]]) and the Orford Quartet (1984, [[ASIN:B00008FLY5 An Evening with Ofra Harnoy and the Orford String Quartet]]). There is also the minor but additional factor that, in conformity with the pronouncements of modern Schubert musicology, they do not play the big crashing chord just before the repeat bar. Modern Schubert musicology has it that the chord should serve only when the repeat is played, but not when the ensemble segues into the development section. Now, to omit the chord when the repeat IS played is, I guess, OK: at least you've heard it once, the first time around. But, although they weren't the first ensemble not to play the repeat but still omit the chord (the first ones to have done that, so far as I can tell, was the Hungarian Quartet in 1970, [[ASIN:B0000CE7FV Schubert: String Quartets 13 - 15 & String Quintet;  Hungarian Quartet]]), hearing the Kocian here, it strikes me how much the pronouncements of modern Schubert musicology are crap, and why (and I am ready for a public debate with any modern Schubert musicologist). First because, of course, they are not based on any study of the sources (Schubert's Quintet was notoriously published more than 20 years after his death and the manuscript is lost) but on the musicologist's subjective impression and/or analysis of what Schubert \""must have intended\"".  But more important still, because Schubert writes a similar crashing chord just AFTER the repeat bar. I can simply NOT imagine that he did not intentionally conceive this chord to be an echo of the first one. And when you don't play the first one, that great effect is simply lost, you get, so to speak, the reaction without the action, and Schubert is badly betrayed. Musicologists are crap and performers should not follow them sheepishly, without thinking, and feeling.<br /><br />OK, so, now that I got that out of my system. With those handicaps to begin with, plus no filler and a paltry TT of 49:10, the interpetation would need to be oustanding to make up for them - and, indeed, the versions mentioned above of the Alban Berg Quartet and Orford Quartet were. Not so with the Kocian Quartet's.<br /><br />They play with faultless ensemble and show moments of fine crispness. But their problem is that they convey no sense of drama, intensity or vehemence. The first movement starts well enough, but once reached the second subject at 1:55, they settle into a comfortable tempo, which in itself is very standard, neither particularly urgent nor particularly spacious, but they never animate it with any kind of vehemence in the more dramatic outbursts, or sense of heart beating faster and breath getting shorter. They remain placid, as if Schubert's Quintet was \""nur Gemütlichkeit\"", only a cozy after-lunch digestive stroll, lazily musing, with no sense of forward momentum, let alone dramatic tension. So I guess there is a coherence after all in the omission of thecrashing chord before the repeat (\""keep it hushed!\""). It hardly comes as a surprise, then, if the vehement violin shouts that follow the little staccato march after the repeat bar, at 5:41, are the weakest and meekest probably ever recorded, although Willy Boskovsky's 1965 Vienna Philharmonic Quintet offers serious competition here (not reissued on CD, see my review under the entry for the LP, ASIN B005HZVMOG). These are always played as something like vehement cries of revolt. With Kocian they sound something like, \""Oh no, please, don't wake me, five more minutes' sleep\"". Not so much the Maiden facing death (to my ears it is not only Schubert's 14th Quartet which can be heard in terms of \""Death and the Maiden\"", or maybe \""Death and Schubert\"") as stung by a tsetse fly. Well, placid, hushed, non-vehement String Quintet may be, on paper, interesting as an \""other view\"", one we are not accustomed to and that could be an ear-opener. But I find that it leaves aside too much of the work's emotional content and impact to have any validity.<br /><br />The sonics don't help either, and I've found myself fretting that, alternately, the viola and first cello weren't given enough presence in their counter-melodies, and that the first cellist was rather dry in tone in his lyrical melodies; or maybe it is that the Quartet's cellist is small-toned and dry, but in any case it robs the music of its body and lyricism, so even their moments of lyricism sound placid and flat.<br /><br />The gentleness the Czech players bring to the 2nd movement is not the standard option but one that I find very acceptable, with cello pizz. so discreet and soft as to feel soothing rather than sound like the tolling of some death knell, and ensuing dialogue in pizzicatti between first violin and second cello also very gentle and soothing, but the same lack of vehemence from the two players badly mauls the middle agitated section. There the first fiddler seems to be gently singing the Maiden's (perhaps forlorn) love, and the second cello's bouncing staccato triplets would be papa's, or Friar Laurence's voice muttering, \""don't worry girl, it'll be allright, it'll be allright\"" and tapping her on the shoulders - is this what Schubert's sublime Adagio is about?<br /><br />In a very perverse way, I'll hold it in Kocian's favor that they also observe the dicates of modern musicology in the Scherzo and make the second repeat much earlier than the repeat bar indicated on the score (2:20), thus not playing the second part of the opening section of the scherzo in toto the first time, because it is an option much more rarely followed, and even those who sheepishly do not play the first movement chord discard that whim of modern musicology; in fact, I've encountered so far only five other versions that did it, the 1986 Juilliard Quartet ([[ASIN:B0000026G8 Franz Schubert: Quintet, D. 956 (C major)]]), the 1991 Hagen Quartet ([[ASIN:B000025EIZ Beethoven: Great Fugue Op.133/Schubert: String Quintet D.956 [IMPORT]]]), the 1992 Brandis Quartet ([[ASIN:B0000037E9 Schubert: String Quintet in C, D. 956]]), the Melos Quartet's 1993 remake ([[ASIN:B00007EEKC Schubert: Quintett in C-dur]]) and the 1994 Raphael Ensemble ([[ASIN:B000NJM4IE Schubert: String Quintet; String Trio]]). That said, Kocian's Scherzo isn't infamous but lacks a touch of beef. They follow the dominant approach which subsitutes vigor to the true drive that seems implied by Schubert's \""presto\"" indication - but without true vigor either.<br /><br />Curiously, they do NOT observe the Third Commandment of modern Schubert musicology, and play the Finale's final chord as the customary diminuendo and not as a forceful accent. Can't blame them, whatever Schubert intended, the diminuendo is a great touch, so performers I beg you, even if it isn't by Schubert, play it! And, hey! Kocian's Finale is fine, with the good combinatiion of charm, playfulness, lyricism (viola and cello now come out very clearly, and while still dry in tone their melodies have plenty of expressive songfulness) and drama (for instance, there is finally a true sense of vehemence in the fugato sections at 4:50 and 5:13, and the coda has enough drive).<br /><br />But, of course, a fine Finale comes too late and is not enough.

There are plenty of excellent books out there with morally bankrupt heroes (Vladimir Nabokov's Humbert Humbert) and good-girl-turned-bad cheaters (Jane Smiley's \""1000 Acres\"") that are still gripping reads with sympathetic, though flawed, characters.<br /><br />\""Something Borrowed\"" is a crappy book because the characters are two-dimensional, the writing is dull, the construction is shoddy, the resolution is unsatisfying and the whole thing is endlessly navel-gazing.<br /><br />I picked it up because I'm getting married in a month and was looking for a fun, fluffy read with a wedding theme. By the time I realized that it not only had no literary value but was also a hell of a bore I had already devoted an afternoon to it and figured I may as well plow through to the end.<br /><br />The premise of \""Something Borrowed\"" is pretty simple: goody-two-shoes lawyer Rachel gets drunk and bones her flighty, annoying BFF Darcy's fiance Dexter, then feels bad about it - but not enough to stop. This goes on for about 200 pages, most of which the reader spends wondering how Rachel and Dexter ever put up with Darcy in the first place, as she's painted exclusively as a self-centered harpy with no apparent redeeming qualities. At the same time we wonder what Dexter sees in Rachel, who has never said or done anything of interest in her life yet feels compelled to disclose every boring detail of her elementary school crushes, college relationships and colossally dull job amidst an endless monologue of \""pithy\"" observations about life as a 30-year-old single lady in Manhattan. The whole thing reads a bit like the Zagat's guide (\""charming garden,\"" \""excellent pea soup,\"" \""neighborhood Italian place\""), with Dexter occasionally swooping in to act all handsome and square-jawed, causing many heart palpitations despite having the personality of aKen doll.<br /><br />Somewhere around page 205 the plot picks up and the reader gets excited, thinking that Rachel may stop whining about her life and actually do something. And she does. She leaves town just long enough for all of the action to resolve in a way that has nothing to do with her, resulting in an ending that packs about as much of a punch as the third grade creative writing classic: \""and then they all got hit by a truck.\""<br /><br />Because - spoiler alert! - it turns out that all along, Darcy was even more awful than we'd been lead to believe (as if such a thing could be possible). Sure, Rachel and Dexter were having an affair, but it turns out that Darcy was having, like, Affair++, allowing the whole thing to wrap up both neatly and unrealistically with zero guilt or even minor moral implications for the heroine.<br /><br />It boggles my mind that anyone even agreed to publish this book, let alone that it became a national best-seller. The whole thing flies in the face of everything you learn in Creative Writing 101 about how to tell a good story, ignoring even the most basic elements of plot, characterization, language and pacing. Cover-to-cover, the Zagat's guide is a better read.",2012-06-20,538,extra_long,2012-06,ebooks

Bleach was released in 1989, but nobody really bought it. If it sounds unfinished, that's because it is - according to producers. This album cost $523 to produce. No filters were used on anything. This is what a garageband really sounds like.<br /><br />(4/5) Blew - This a great opener. It represents the rest of the album well with a powerful riff, weird lyrics, and cymbal-lead drumming. I honestly have no idea what this song is about. This also has my favorite solo on here.<br /><br />(4.5/5) Floyd The Barber - I love this song. I don't know why, I just do. The simple two-chord riff fits the mood well. It's about an alternate reality world where the characters from the Andy Griffith Show are... well, I can't say it, but let's just say that they are serial \""abusers.\""<br /><br />(4/5) About A Girl - This is the \""poppiest\"" song on the album. It's not driven by loud drums and deep power chords, instead lead by a simple three-chord riff through almost the whole thing. It's about his then-girlfriend Tobi Vail (but she didn't even find out until 1998!)<br /><br />(5/5) School - This is my favorite song on here, along with Negative Creep. It's a VERY simple two-note riff (dun-dun-dun-dun-DUN-dun-DUN-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-DUN) until the chorus which changes to a very \""rocking\"" chord pattern. Along with one of the best solos on here, this song is perfect.<br /><br />(3/5) Love Buzz - This is a very eastern-sounding song. There's not much to say about it. It's a cover of the Shocking Blues.<br /><br />(1.5/5) Paper Cuts - I REALLY can't stand this song. It has an incredibly annoying riff with impossible to understand lyrics. It's based off of a real story from Aberdeen County where a woman locked her kids in a shed,.<br /><br />(5/5) Negative Creep - This song is SO Punk. It is the fastest song on the album with a pounding opener, great picking chorus, and strained vocals.<br /><br />(3.5/5) Scoff - This is a pretty average song. Not very bad, not very good either. It opens with Chad's drumming, then goes to a muted riff. Not very notable.<br /><br />(4.5/5) Swap Meet - I like this song simply because it makes no sense. Not much else to say.<br /><br />(3.5/5) Mr. Moustache - Kurt strains out some vocals about wizards and cows. Pretty weird.<br /><br />(1/5) Sifting - This song goes ON and ON and OOOOOOOOOON! It never changes it's boring riff (dun-dun-dun-DUN-dun-dun-dun-DUN-DUN-DUN), it has annoying drumming, and terrible lyrics. This is actually my least favorite Nirvana song.<br /><br />(4/5) Big Cheese - DAT OPENING. It sounds like a rock version of the Jaws theme, then shifts into this fast-moving high-note riff. It also has great lyrics.<br /><br />(3/5) Downer - Pretty bland. At only 1:43, it's the shortest song on the album. It opens with a fast bass riff and then goes to the same riff on the guitar. There's no guitar during the verses. He talks (I say talk because this cannot count as singing during the verses) so fast during the verse that you can barely understand what he's saying.

The graphics are very well done, yet the best part of the game mechanics that is rarely seen in other games is the extensive destructible environment. You can blast out a wall with an rpg which adds a new depth to a combat game. However, until I played ARMA 2, operation arrowhead I didn't know what I was missing in terms of sheer simulation realness. ARMA 2 is something you have to check out if you haven't already. If you're looking for a real type of battlefield experience that ARMA 2 is no comparison to Battlefield. I just downloaded ARMA 2 yesterday and played it for 9 hours straight which has brought me through about 75 percent boot camp mode. I was surprised as to how deep this game is when I started playing it. You aren't just blasting things with weapons, but rather, shooting is only a small part of what you will experience in ARMA 2. Just the boot camp mode of the game is a whole game in itself so far. The vehicles are amazingly realistic as well, much more than in Battlefield 3. Flying the Apache training mission in boot camp is just a real treat to experience. ARMA has very realistic feeling flight modeling; the whole game just screams attention to detail and if you thought the environments were big in Battlefield 3 you realize that you have a whole different animal with ARMA 2. We are talking \""out as far as you can see\"" distance that you will have to navigate with gps and maps. I will update as I get more into ARMA but so far this game has blown me away with its realism and gorgeous graphics and modeling. You actually get the feeling you are flying over real terrain; Microsoft Flight Simulator x is not even quite as good graphics wise in terrain in my opinion. I also get silky smooth frame rates with settings all on high from 2 gtx 550's in sli. ARMA 2 is going to be very deep and I am stoked about having discovered it. ARMA 2 seems to be set up so that almost anything you want to explore in a battlefield is there, letting you explore the path you wish to take and find your niche.

I am about to attract the enmity of that following by this mostly negative review.<br /><br />While I found the writing and pacing of the novel to be wholly professional, the contents were, to my eye, so unattractive as to make it almost unreadable. I have to include a few minor spoilers to continue so, please review reader, be forewarned of that.<br /><br />The in the first third of the book, the identity of a killed woman is the central mystery. This is sensible for the fictional participants who are mostly part of a Singapore crime investigative organization, but given the title of the book, the woman's identity is hardly a mystery to the reader. For me, I wanted to shout at this book, \""Let's get going. The dead woman is clearly the ambassador's wife\"". To say that as a police procedural, the pacing was glacial is to put it mildly but that's ok if the slow moving pace includes interesting places and people.<br /><br />It does not. The protagonist is a lazy, rather dimwitted, brooding and ineffective officious egoist. For example, although a homicide detective for 15 years, he is too squeamish to examine the dead woman's body in detail and refuses, even upon request by the medical examiner, to inspect certain aspects of the crime as reflected on the victim's body in the postmortem. Inspector - this is your job - to be justice for the victims. Your job does not include pampering your personal neurotic tendencies and sensitivities.<br /><br />Further, the inspector is lazy to an amazing degree. The woman is found killed in a hotel. The inspector orders all the other rooms on the floor emptied for no reason ever given as in aid to the investigation but then does not show the energy to interview those people who were in those rooms. So he uses his police power to disrupt but not to further the investigation.<br /><br />The inspector shows contempt for almost all he encounters. He bullies the hotel management because they are Americans (he figures) and are open and fully cooperative rather than being - what? Dour Brits or sour somethings? He feels the same way about an FBI agent who commits the hideous crime of assuming he and the inspector are allies in the fight on crime and so approaches the inspector informally. The inspector also despises another woman, again an American, for having a crush on him. He is too lazy to either write, wire, send a message or call his mom who lives in New York City and has recently had a stroke. She is predictably married to an American. Instead he chooses to chain smoke and brood on this during the critical time right after she fell ill.<br /><br />All right, so the protagonist of the novel struck me wrong, but if I only got an interesting insider's look at life in and the city of Singapore, this would be a good read. Rather than that, we see the city through the bitter depressing eyes of the protagonist who only sees a city which is losing its spirit to modernism. We learn that Singapore is always brutally hot - even to Tay who is a lifelong resident. My thought was that if the residents of a place find it miserable, I sure don't wish to see it myself. So I've erased Singapore from my wish to see list. A boring city with an unbearable climate is hardly a place I wish to visit.<br /><br />I can go on, but in the end, there is nothing at all I can recommend about this book except that it's well written. I only wish that the writing concerned something interesting or worthwhile to read.><br />The inspector shows contempt for almost all he encounters.

However, when I come up against something I just can't do in Pages - table cells that flow over more than one page; a document that requires proper numbering - I know that I can switch to Word and do it.<br /><br />But I only switch when I absolutely have to, because the general experience of using Word is not pleasant.  The two main problems are:<br /><br />1.  Annoying, little, but prominent, bugs.  It took me less than 10 minutes of using the 2011 version before I came across one of these.  I set up some styles and wanted to use them in a table.  Every time I tried to switch some text in a table cell to the style I wanted, it would immediately switch back to 'Unknown' style.  I was eventually able to get it to do what I wanted by deleting the table cell and creating a new one.  Not much of a problem - but this is the general experience of using Word - little things that just get in your way.  It never, ever 'just works'.<br /><br />2.  Idiotic user interface decisions.  Most obviously, whether you like the ideas behind the Ribbon or not, its current implementation, from a Mac point of view is just plain idiotic.  Almost 80% of macs sold are MacBooks - with a screen aspect ratio of 16:10.  Having a user interface that stacks great big ribbons and toolbars at the top of the screen while leaving huge quantities of space at the side of the screen is just bad, bad UI design.  And, despite 5 or more years of the ribbon, Microsoft still hasn't given the option of placingthe ribbon on the side.  Again, this is the general experience of using Word - a user interface which actually seems to go out of its way not to give you simple things that would make using it so much easier.<br /><br />(You can turn the ribbon off and use menus or 'toolboxes' - but again you immediately hit another clunker.  The toolboxes can be resized vertically - but not horizontally.  So in the case of the Styles toolbox, you're limited to about 10 characters for a 12pt style name and if a style has a large margin or font, you wont actually be able to read the name at all.  There is no reason why you should not be able to resize these toolboxes - with the screen aspect ratio, there is plenty of horizontal room and Microsoft must actually have turned off the standard window behavior which allows resizing.  Why?  It literally feels like the UI designers are trying to annoy their users.)<br /><br />Again, these issues and the many others may seem like little things, but they're often related to features I use a lot and I'm certain that every user will find a UI decision and/or little bug that just makes using Word an absolute pain.  This is supposed to be a tool that transparently allows you to pour creativity into your document, not into finding new ways to curse at your wretched word processor.<br /><br />So no, if you have any choice in the matter, I would not recommend Word 2011.  However, you can't say Microsoft doesn't pack those features in like its life depended on it.  Which it does.  Because the rest of the pack is catching up, and as soon as they do, it will be my great pleasure never to use Word ever again.",2012-02-16,673,extra_long,2012-02,software

Messina's best-known work, his composition for the score of the immensely successful Juno, is renowned as creative, prolific, and remarkably representative of the film's content considering its unique motifs. With Butter, Messina again presents a listening experience in stark contrast to most modern and traditional film scores, but while successful in that regard, Butter will challenge film score listeners with frustrating elements in parallel.<br /><br />Butter's first track sets the stage for the score's energetic, Motown-inspired contents, and right from the start and regardless of one's exposure to the film, will get your foot tapping and prompt a casual smile. Though the leadoff song is the only one that contains vocals, the primary remainder of the score retains the Motown and moonlighting musical elements of alternating drum percussion and clapping, organ- and piano-driven tunes, and careless fun, all of which easily lend themselves to feelings of childlike nostalgia and tongue-in-cheek humor (furthered by the songs' titles). Unfortunately, the prevalence of this overall sound with little variability is one of the score's weaknesses, except on \""Smokin'\"" when electric guitar riffs are incorporated or on \""Knife Sisters\"" when electronic elements are introduced. On later tracks such as the effective \""867 Sticks of Butter,\"" Messina gets a little more soulful and emotive and temporarily ceases the percussion, but too soon later the foundational musical elements return, almost totally abolishing any lasting impression upon the listener.<br /><br />And \""too soon\"" is Butter's Achilles' heel indeed; with the score totaling forty-five tracks and duration of forty minutes, even a listener with an incredibly short attention span will quickly grow frustrated by how often the music starts anew and slightly changes direction. At seemingly the exact point when one becomes aurally invested, the cycle begins again with another track, and I can't help but think that if they were longer, or joined with organ-driven monochromatic leads at the very least, Butter's songs would illustrate a much more effective stylistic energy. While I have no doubt that the music is more fitting and rewarding in the film, the structure doesn't truly lend itself to a standalone score release. Consequently, Mateo Messina's Butter has an interesting style, but lacks cohesion; it illustrates thoughtfulness, but not continuance; it exudes life, but doesn't incite passion. Finally, and most importantly, while Butter has energy, it doesn't have electricity, and for that reason, is solely recommended to fans of the Butter film itself, than to that of film score listeners and collectors.ther track, and I can't help but think that if they were longer, or joined with organ-driven monochromatic leads at the very least, Butter's songs would illustrate a much more effective stylistic energy.

(If I purchase a book, I do not read reviews before reading it because I prefer to form my own, uninfluenced opinion.)  In reading the reviews here, I found only one that had found anything `bothersome'. With the amount of non-stop action, I can understand the other readers' enchantment. However, at the risk of these individuals taking umbrage with me, I should like to offer reasons for my personal disagreement.<br />The author asks the reader to read all three books in the series \""in order not to miss some key elements\"". It is my personal belief that an author owes it to his readers to allow each book, even in a series, to be able to `stand on its own' so a reader can read others only if sufficiently intrigued. However, I believe that in this telling the author has missed no \""key elements\"" that interfere with presentation of the story. The author has made sufficient `allusions' to the situation, and its characters, for a reader to properly `come up to date' and equate with the present events.<br />The book is reputed to be a mystery. The Oxford English Dictionary definition is \""something that is difficult or impossible to understand or explain\"". It definitely is that, and as such, not a \""mystery\"" in the more commonly accepted genre form (which I had been expecting). In fact, its exact position is difficult to describe. Supernatural, probably, fantasy possibly, but here I find a problem with the presentation; e.g. persons not previously demonstrated as having any `supernatural' abilities appear to possess them; i.e. Kirk's level of ability to perform directly following the physical destruction suffered. Other discrepancies are differences in the city's amount of activity when shifting from differing character descriptions and actions, Mark's requirement to \""find his lost book\"" a couple of chapters after he and Kreios had found it and Mark had given it to `another Kreios' for safekeeping. I shall not provide further detail because I do not wish to be a `spoiler' and disrupt other readers' possible enjoyment.<br />But, to attempt to assess In Your Dreams, from my personal position, I must consider the number of `worse scenario' fears existing in today's society, the underlying plot, and the existing occult overtones that include demon-like characters. As a result, my perhaps unusual impression is that the author has provided a story portraying a moral and political treatise, probably subconsciously, which brings to mind Milton's Paradise Lost. Art work accompanying Dante's Inferno and the long argued belief in parallel worlds that were used years ago even by Louis L'Amour seem also to have been influential.<br />Therefore, to be fair, the book was not what I expected and, for me, presents a confusing allegorical attempt, but certainly provides enough physical action, poltergeist and similar spirit manifestations to be enjoyable for aficionados of such stories.

I like to take long distance trains, and I like to read on the train.<br /><br />Theoretically the Kindle should be ideal for travel guides.  Light, searchable, what could go wrong?  Apparently, quite a lot.<br /><br />In sum, here are the problems with the Kindle version of this travel guide:<br /><br />1. Maps are unreadable.  Either they are condensed onto one page (with miniscule type that is unreadable with a magnifying glass.  I actually took a magnifying glass and tried to read it.  I couldn't) or split haphazardly where one map is on several pages.<br /><br />2. Lists are unreadable.  Apparently, no one paid attention to formatting the page margins of, say, the list of trains that leave Delhi.  The name of the train is listed, as is the fare, but then it cuts off, literally in mid-word.  It costs 200 rupees to go to Udai...>  Where exactly?  I think it means Udaipur, but I can't be sure.  Also, I have no idea how long it takes to get to Udai....  This is true for every single such list in the book.<br /><br />3. The table of contents doesn't really work. Links are nonintuitive and don't really work.  In some sections links work differently than the analagous links in other sections.<br /><br />4. In fact, searching the book is pretty much useless.  If you enter Pushkar, it gives you a list of every time the word \""Pushkar\"" appears in the book.  Introduction, side notes, glossary, it doesn't care.  It also gives you a tiny snippet of text, but not enough to identify if clicking on that will take you to the section on Pushkar, where you can find a hotel, or the index, or some inane note in the beginning in a section about agricultural fairs in India where Pushkar gets mentioned.<br /><br />All in all, the job of taking this from the print to the Kindle format seems to have been done haphazardly, by separate teams of IT people that apparently never talked to each other, nor compared notes.  Additionally, and this I find really unbelievable, apparently no one at LP actually proofread this book.  The map and list problems aren't minor.  They jump out at you about five minutes after you start reading the book, and they persist.<br /><br />So, after dropping twenty bucks or so on this thing, I actually had to go and spend more money to pick up the print copy.

PRO: the new \""tactical defending\"" introduced in FIFA 12 appeals to me much more than the classic method of defending in the previous versions. it makes you play much more intelligently, timing your standing tackles to perfection; failure to do so results in either committing a foul or the attacker getting past you. you have to contain the attacker (sometimes even with two defenders), fill the gaps between your own players, try to intercept the attacker's passes, all the while making sure you're not committing a foul.  PRO: the graphics are a bit better as well.  PRO/CON: the new \""player impact engine\"" is a blessing and a curse. it makes the collisions more realistic compared to the older version, and the injuries are now based on the physics of the collision rather than some random variable! but since its code is not polished enough, it'll also make for some ridiculously weird collision scenes you've ever seen. just search YouTube for some samples.  CON: it's weird that for a title released in 2012, the developers still can't make 3D grass. it's a shame that community modders are doing what EA developers should have done for this game in the first place. forget about rendering the grass during the game-play (you're concentrating on the game rather than the grass), but at least they could have added 3D grass to replay scenes in order to make things look more pleasant and real.  CON: the game stutters like hell. you need all sort of workarounds to fix that issue. EA has totally failed to fix this with the SINGLE patch they've released for the game so far (they don't even care at this point; FIFA 13 anyone?). don't take my word for it and head to the official EA FIFA forums ( forum.ea.com /uk / forums / show / 58.page ) and click on the sticky'd thread \""For those with stuttering problems please post here\"" and read through 24 pages (up to now) of complaints. people with all sorts of hardware (from low-end to high-end GPUs, from single-core to quad-core CPUs) have been dealing with this issue since the release of the game. consider yourself lucky if you don't have this problem.  CON: the firewall issue on the PC version is as wide-spread as the micro-stuttering issue. no matter what you do to your modem/router/computer's firewall settings, the in-game firewall indicator always shows RESTRICTED, giving you hell to connect to other players for head-to-head matches. i personally have to try nearly twenty times to be able to play one match online, and i have disabled my DSL modem's firewall, disabled my router's firewall, and disabled my Windows 7 firewall. nothing works. again, don't take my word for it and head to the official EA forums. and again, consider yourself lucky if you don't have this problem.  CON: if you have bought the disc version of the game, in order to get the latest game patches, you need to download the whole game with Origin again; that is about 6GB of data! seriously EA? how hard is it to patch YOUR OWN game?  CON: if you have made your own team in the creation center and want to play a match with that against any other team, you CANNOT change your team's tactics and players before the match starts. if you do so, FIFA 12 crashes to desktop!  now, once you get past all these issues (read, IF you can get past them), the game is very enjoyable and nice. but for this price, it's simply not worth buying, considering all the bugs. my older FIFA 11 on Xbox 360 has none of these issues and works flawlessly and plays smoothly. it shows how important the PC platform is to EA (hint: not important at all). i bet they've completely given up working on ironing out the bugs for FIFA 12 and instead are preparing FIFA 13 to be released later this year. this is a game that runs on 6-year old hardwares (Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3); it's nothing like Battlefield 3 or Crysis 2 and should run perfectly without any issues on any fairly modern hardware; but it does not!  my recommendation after playing this game for 4 months: get it for your PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 if you really want to relax and play FIFA 12. the PC port is poorly coded and completely ignored by the developers and the publisher and is a waste of money.",2012-01-31,801,extra_long,2012-01,games

I love Bill Murray to pieces, but he's not without a mistake from time to time.  The same thing we're all guilty of, in fact.  The problem here is that the type of humor just doesn't appeal to me.  I can sit here and say the Man Who Knew Too Little is awful but the reality is that it just doesn't fit my tastes.  It's about Bill's character going to England to meet up with his brother.  He's surrounded by extravagant people -or so he believes- that are all actors and actresses.<br /><br />The entire film is based around one specific type of comedy- that being, Bill finding himself in situations where he believes the people are acting, so he joins in and improvises his own lines however.... these people are actually serious- Bill's the only one who doesn't realize this.  So for example, in one segment when a gun is pulled on Bill while he's roaming the streets, he quickly comes up with a few convincing lines believing it's part of a rehearsal or play, not even realizing that his life is actually in danger.  To add more to the misery, the guy pulling the gun hesitates because he's confused.  The robber *should* have shot Bill to make it crystal clear this is a real robbery.  This is the type of humor the movie is going for.  If you like this scene you'll probably like the rest of the movie.  If you don't, *turn it off now*.  This situation should be funny given Bill's track record as a hilarious comedian in films such as Groudhog Day and What About Bob\"", but it ends up creating no reaction out of me whatsoever (perhaps because what's considered humorous here reaches a level of neverending ridiculousness that's too absurd to even bother with).  Once you see the first 20 minutes, you know what to expect because the type of humor never changes.  Again, matter of taste.<br /><br />For some -or rather, for most- this sounds like a wonderful idea on paper until you watch it and realize the film is going for a James Bond-type of storytelling.  Since I hate James Bond films with a passion and will never make the mistake of watching another one again, it doesn't work for me.  Even if this is supposed to be a satire of Bond movies, it doesn't change the fact that only Bond fans can understand the events taking place.  I have no problem placing this movie in the same category and that you have to have some kind of understanding or knowledge of Bond films in order to appreciate the humor.  I don't.  Even worse are the British people who are hard to understand as well.  Not just their accent, but actions and demeanors.  Hey I love the British- I talk to them online all the time and love the conversations, but their take on comedy never really made any sense to me.  I guess the one thing I can't fault is the writing.  It does create an elaborate well-told storyline that's easier to understand if you're into this sort of thing, even though I personally despise it and can't sit through it without cringing.<br /><br />Overall, have an understanding of James Bond films and the British and a movie like this will probably make total sense then.  The way I see it, Bill Murray really dropped the ball by participating in this movie when his talents run far deeper than this.",2012-12-01,582,extra_long,2012-12,videos

Unfortunately, this book has left me with the same frustration that I always get when I try to learn programming.

There seems to be some basic, core concepts that I am missing that seems to prevent me from thinking in a way necessary to come up with the solutions (or even similar ones) that the author presents.  The problem I always seem to run in to is that there never seems to be enough explanation of the core OOP structure that I am looking for.

There were a number of crippling bugs, and frustrated users weren't even able to get into the game to play it.  However, my experience has generally been very positive as installation and initial play (with one exception mentioned below) went off without a hitch.  I downloaded the software from Amazon (about 10 gigabytes) overnight and then let it install while I was at work.  When I got home in the afternoon, everything was working fine.  No headache at all.  It is also worth noting that Origin has given me absolutely no trouble.  Remember when Steam came out?  Lots of people (including myself) were upset with it when it didn't work.  Now Steam is widely used and praised for its useful interface and lack of trouble.  Origin will be the same way.  I realize what I've mentioned so far is mostly anecdotal evidence, but I feel it worth pointing out that I have two friends I play with that didn't have any trouble either.  Now, as for Battlelog, I do not understand what all the fuss is about.  Yes, it launches in a web browser, and I suppose that is a little weird, but it works fine!  It's really no different from launching from within the game itself.  I use Firefox, and have had no trouble with it either.  Additionally, the Battlelog stats are awesome, and it's fun to see how you are doing with overall score, unlocks, k/d ratio, and to be able to compare it to others.  I also appreciate the ability to log in from another computer to see stats or show them to friends.  One negative I did experience was a bug that caused the game to crash at the end of nearly every multiplayer match.  I updated video drivers, adjusted some game and origin settings, but nothing worked.  Finally, after doing some research I came across a forum which suggested uninstalling Asus Gamer OSD.  I did so, and this got rid of the problem completely.  Aside from this issue, I have encountered no bugs or random crashes.  Now, onto the actual gameplay.  I can pretty much reconfirm what all the major reviews are saying: the multiplayer is amazing, dynamic, and fun, but the single player is \""bleh\"".  The multiplayer feels very well balanced with 4 different classes to choose from.  The unlocks come quickly enough to keep you interested and playing, but not so quickly that you lose interest.  This is the part of the game that everyone is buying it for, and, trust me, it stands up to the hype.  The single player leaves a lot to be desired.  It almost plays like a technology demonstrator to show off the graphics (and, holy cow, they are amazing!).  There are scenes in the single player which gave me a great big grin (for instance, the launch off the carrier deck in the F/A-18), and the AI is reasonably intelligent.  However, the single player falls short in three critical areas: lack of a compelling story, lack of compelling characters, and some of the most linear/scripted gameplay I've ever experienced.  The story revolves around a terrorist that is trying to use a train to blow up a high value target, but the story meanders quite a bit and feels like a series of disconnected episodes.  The characters are incredibly flat and two dimensional.  You just don't care about any of them.  Gameplay is structured very rigidly with the game determining the pace, not the player.  Advance too quickly and you get shot dead, and advance too slowly and you have to deal with missing objectives or endless respawns.  There are also a lot of the \""press spacebar to kill this dude\"" type scenes.  *Yawn*  Might as well just show a cut scene for all the interaction those provide.  All of these gameplay choices will endlessly remove you from the immersion and remind you that you are only playing a game.  This is a shame, as Dice could created such an amazing single player campaign from this engine.  Despite the shortcomings of the singleplayer campaign, I still highly recommend this game due to the amazing multiplayer features and the absence of the troubles which hampered the game's launch.  The multiplayer is simply lots of fun and quite addictive.  If you happen to enjoy first person shooters, I highly recommend this game.

That is a false statement on Amazon's part. The state is NOT included at all on this version. This digital download allows you to do your federal taxes, then it prompts you to download the state for an additional 44.95 from the turbo tax website. I called Amazon tech support & was informed, the software \""did allow for preparing the state & printing, as they put the option there for you to pay for the state & download it from turbo tax after you had paid them (Intuit) for it\"". Amazon is stating, that just the ability of the software to prompt you to pay for & download the state software from within this federal software is the ability to prepare & print both tax forms. HOWEVER I see it as false advertising on Amazon's part as it clearly states that only the efile state is an additional fee, but you can prepare & print state with what you get here.<br /><br />I have done lots of business with Amazon & this is the first thing I have ever had a problem with. I do really feel cheated since I had to pay an additional 44.95 to get my state software from Intuit just to be able to print them out & mail them USPS. I will never buy this software from amazon again next year.<br /><br />Also on a previous review I seen a person had trouble importing last years return. I also had trouble with this version & importing last years return which was prepared with Turbo Tax.

At first glance, it seems like a remarkably good 4X game, it has a diversity of races to play, a randomized tech tree, and interesting Homeworld style space battles. (Its from the same production team) The problem is, this game is very unsteady and doesn't obey the fundamental principles of 4X gaming. A 4X game should follow the rule that when you have more planets, more production, and more populace, you get more income, better research, and more ships. This game partially follows that rule, but there is a very fine line drawn because of the planet hazard when colonizing. You literally need to break down the risk/reward of colonizing different planets using X number of either destroyer or cruiser ships, vs the cost of owning those planets and the time it takes to get them up to speed and being productive. That might be interesting if they told you outright, but they don't, leaving you figuring it out by trial and error. Expand too much, and your economy shuts down as everything goes to planet upkeep, expand too slow, and you get outpaced by other players. Its really irritating.<br /><br />The tech tree is interesting in being randomized, but it also means you don't know what technologies you can count on. Some are core and are always there, some are randomized. You might think cruiser class colony ships are core technology, since they allow you to expand to very hostile worlds very rapidly. They aren't, and if you focus your research toward getting them and find the tech isn't there, you end up pretty screwed. This is but one example of the difficulty in planning effective strategy. Lots of the techs are either very weak or outright useless, others are exceptionally powerful and very necessary. Again, much trial, error, and frustration in sorting out which is which.<br /><br />The AI is my biggest issue, not just because it knows what its doing while your floundering around, but because it obviously gets a resource handicap on normal difficulty. I've played dozens of games now using different game variables using almost all of the different races. The results are almost always the same, I rank at the top in population and colonies, middle in income, and ALWAYS dead last in technology. I've even tried putting every cent into research as the Liir, the best researchers of the game, and I never budge off the bottom in tech. I'm constantly being outclassed in technology by races that have even half as many colonies as I do at all points in the game, its ridiculous. Playing the game on easy means you just plow right on over them, and easily wipe out their homeworld with your first attack fleet.<br /><br />This game is probably alot more fun on multiplayer, but I've never been much of a multiplayer fan, except for much faster paced games. This game takes a really long time to learn and you'll probably be pretty irritated along each step of it. There are tons of minor details that take a long time to figure out and are pretty important, especially with the interface and gameplay. I really wanted to like this game, it seems like it would be pretty interesting and fun if it made any kind of sense.",2012-06-20,569,extra_long,2012-06,games

Overall, I have been very content with it (even though they force you to purchase upgrades or not be able to utilize payroll or update services.)  When I bought a Mac computer, I purchased the Quickbooks for Mac software, since I would be forced to purchase their newest version for pc in the month of May '12 anyway.  This was a serious mistake!  My payroll had to be completely re-entered manually from the beginning of the year.  None of it was transferrable.  This was no small feat; it took many, many hours of my time and multiple phone calls to quickbooks (another story entirely.)  My weekly payroll now needs to be exported into my quickbooks checkbook as the 'service' is now provided from an outside source inclusive of me typing in the individual check numbers for each employee.  The features that are offered pale in comparison to the pc based version.  If I could go back to the comforts of the version I know, I'd do it in a heartbeat.

The performances are all good to excellent, and in general, feature well-known national musicians from various countries in central and eastern Europe -- particularly Bulgaria.<br /><br />I have to agree with the previous reviewer that the great Hungarian pianist Jeno Jando's performance of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 is a major draw on its own and itself worth the price of the set. Although the rest may be gravy, it is actually fairly substantial gravy.<br /><br />A highlight of the collection is a complete cycle of Beethoven's five piano concertos, performed by Anton Dikov, a very well respected Bulgarian pianist and professor at Sofia's music academy. His Beethoven recordings have been packaged and repackaged countless times on classical compilations -- I'm sure due in part to their availability at a low price for the seller. But don't mistake cheap for low quality -- these performances are nuanced and enjoyable, featuring the Sofia Philharmonic under Bulgarian composer and conductor Emil Tabakov, whose recordings are available extensively on the Capricco label. Naxos has also recorded several of Tabakov's own works.<br /><br />Both of Chopin's concertos are included, the first performed by Sandor Falvai, a piano professor at Hungary's Franz Liszt Academy, and the second by the noted Polish Chopin interpreter Adam Harasiewicz. These performances of the concertos often surface together -- as they do on [[ASIN:B000001VFK this CD]].<br /><br />Gyula Kiss, professor at Hungary's Franz Liszt Music Academy turns in fine performances of Liszt's first and second piano concertos, as well as Mozart's \""Coronation\"" concerto. Bach's concerto nos. 1, 4 and 5 for Piano, Strings and Continuo performed by respected Bulgarian composer and conductor Vassil Kazandjiev, with Dora Milanova on piano.<br /><br />The disc closes with a great Concerto in F by Gershwin, played by French concert pianist Cecile Ousset and conducted by Sir Neville Marriner -- from [[ASIN:B000001WP0 this CD]] on the Capriccio label.<br /><br />I could go on, but the playing and recording is solid on this set.

I thought that finally the world would have the chance to see that all gays are not the drama queens portrayed on TV; I was wrong! The first couple of shows started out ok, but soon the show turned from farming to, well, ummm, drama. Instead of the show focusing on farming and all things involved with farming, which is what I had hoped the show would be about, the subject of each show turned out to be about Brent being a rip roaring little b**t*h to Josh and them hocking their products like a cheap QVC program. Not only did the show have very little to do with farming, but it also had very little to do with love and respect for each other. Brent comes across as a Martha Stewart wannabe. The difference between Martha and Brent is Martha has some class while Brent has zero class. It seems that Brent's only true interest in fame. I am baffled as to why Josh would stay in a relationship where he is treated so poorly. I guess despite being an author and having a career, in the advertising field, that even a guy who should want more from a partner will settle for less than he deserves. Love is blind! The show really should not have been promoted as two gay city boys leaving the city for a life in the country as farmers. Neither of them seems to do a lick of work as far as farming goes; they seem completely clueless as to what farming really is. My partner and I are real farmers and we're way too busy to fight constantly and backstab the way Brent and Josh appear to do. We don't have the luxury of having a person like Farmer John doing the manual work for us, we do it all by ourselves! My partner and I are real gay farmers; we know the feeling of aching bones, blistered hands, torn up knuckles and sleepless nights. We know what it's like to work in the blazing sun and tend to animals in blizzards and pouring rain. We know what it's like to fail and succeed at farming. We know what it is like to be in the barn on freezing nights helping a lamb or baby goat be born. We don't make a living hocking our products on a TV show, that is promoted as a farming show, we make our living by actually working our fingers to the bone and being diversified in what we do on the farm to keep income coming in so that we can live our dream of being farmers. I read that this show is moving to the Cooking Channel. That leaves me wondering if the Cooking Channel people have so much as a clue what they're doing??????? The only people interested in The Fabulous Beekman Boys would be people who like low class drama. Sorry, but this show is not geared towards real farmers, people in love or gay couples. This show is geared towards the people who would be just as happy watching Jersey Shore, Bridezilla or any other low class reality show. If you want to know about real farming, the work involved with real farming and couples working together in a loving relationship while doing real farming than watch RFD-TV. If you want to watch a couple treat each other with little respect, appear to do nothing that doesn't involve drama and is not really farm related than watch reruns of Married With Children. Also, these two salesmen are great at selling, but I guess that's pretty easy when you're mostly female fans, and small group of male fans are gullible. I won't be watching their show when it moves to The Cooking Channel, I will be watching RFD-TV, where the farmers are real and the people treat each other with respect!",2012-06-10,658,extra_long,2012-06,videos

There's a scene where she confronts Jack's editor with all the astuteness and shrewdness of a well experienced female attorney of today.  I found that characterization to be a little off for 1928, when woman had barely obtained the right to vote 8 years previously.  Helen is just too modern a woman for the time.<br /><br />2.

I usually end up liking only a handful of songs from her albums. Every year it seems, especially the last 3-4, she has to release her obligatory annual album. \""Good Girl Gone Bad\"" was as close to a masterpiece that Rihanna has ever come, \""Rated R\"" Capitalized on her \""then-split\"" from Chris Brown, and \""Loud\"" would be a close second as my fav Riri disc. Lots of fun, upbeat and not nearly as depressing as a lot of her content has become as of recent.<br /><br />\""Talk That Talk\"" was fairly decent, mostly cohesive. I count 9 songs off the deluxe edition in my ipod to date. But I found that as much as I enjoy \""We Found Love\"", this album gave me the feeling that it was rushed and hurried into production to be there on time for x-mas sales and black friday. As much as I got that mediocre feeling with \""Talk That Talk\"", I am feeling it even more now with \""Unapologetic\"".<br /><br />\""Diamonds\"" was a terrible lead single. I hate the way that Rihanna is trying to do vocal aerobics like she is Beyonce or something on this track. Light hearted fare like \""What's my Name\"" is far better suited to Rihanna, as opposed to trying to come off as an accomplished student of voice. Not buying it. The music dosen't rope me in and the lyrics are quite remedial. It reeked of desperation from the moment I heard it.<br /><br />Overall the album doesn't feel like a cohesive work. It sounds more to me like a mix of studio leftovers from previous recording sessions and tracks recorded in haste, to get this crap out the public ASAP! \""Phresh Off The Runway\"" has a fun track, but I can barely even understand what she is saying under the autotune nightmare that is her vocals. \""Numb\"" is one of the songs that is listenable for me, but I sometimes cringe when I arrive at Eminem's wasted guest appearance. I wasn't feeling \""Loveeee Song\"" or \""Pour it up\"", nothing really keeping me engaged in the music, vocals are forgettable. I did enjoy \""What Now\"" in spite of the cliched backing ballad track. Sounds like Beyonce's \""Hello\"" to me. But I still enjoy it.<br /><br />\""Nobody's Business\"" is pathetic. Im tired of all the attention Riri and Chris Brown get for their dysfunction. I dont care about your love life. I care about the music. needless to say, they clearly do not. It's a forgettable track about two stars so self-involved that they have to write dumb crap like this just to get attention. \""Get It Over With\"" is a song that I can listen to without qualms. I like the dreamy, light and calm production of the song. Almost makes her seem human for a brief moment. \""Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary\"" is a mixed bag for me. I listen to the song until it gets to the \""Mother Mary\"" part. It kinda gets bland for me once the song hits that point.<br /><br />Most of what else is here is barely worth mentioning. Ballads like \""Stay\"" have never been Rihanna's strong suit, and there isn't anything special or mind popping about the song at all.  \""No Love Allowed\"" is just some more generic reggae styled crap that is also becoming a headache for me. Ever since \""Man Down\"" she thinks that every time she does this itll be a hit. Its a hard disc to get through folks. Thank my lucky stars it was free.<br /><br />Rihanna seems to be taking her superstardom for granted at this point. Her last 4 albums have been mostly hit or miss for me. Whats awesome is absolutely great, but when she is bad, she really sucks. This album completly exposes itself for what it really is: A half-assed, mediocre attempt at capitalising on tabloid controversies and attempt to get street credit by saying the F-word a LOT and a bunch of flimsy  single sexual entendres.<br /><br />There is nothing groundbreaking here. No new territory to be explored. Its more of the same stale formula that Rihanna has worn out on her last 1,000 albums. Some of the songs don't even sound finished, and that was kinda of an issue I had with \""Talk That Talk\"". Rushed. Half-baked. Unengaging and uninspiried. I honestly at this point want to know what lyrics that the \""team\"" or Rihanna herself have written that your average fifth grader cannot....<br /><br />It's really not worth buying, and if you do have to listen, I hope your ears don't bleed. Not much else to say....barf! is Rihanna even believeing what she is selling at this point? Some of it is good, but overall, the big picture just sees the crap to good ratio on her discs working more in favor of crap. Dont Download it and don't buy the coaster. The person who gifted this to me meant well, but I can't take anymore of Rihanna. Its really just all hype. Remind me again why people actually spend money on this?",2012-12-19,850,extra_long,2012-12,music

But...","So like many others viewing this page and buying this album \""THIS IS THE ALBUM WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO FOR THE LAST 10+ YEARS\"".<br /><br />How does it stand up?<br /><br />Before doing this review, I listened to \""Badmotofinger\"", \""Superunknown\"", and \""Down on the Upside\"" to get a feel of what I needed to say.<br /><br />I'll safely say that the first three songs are the most thunderous on the album and probably worth the entire price on Amazon. It's great to hear Chris Cornell finally teamed back up with Soundgarden. There's more talent in Kim Thayil's shit than there is in the entire leftovers of Audioslave and he still shows it. Gone are the days of Tom Morello doing solos that sound like he's trying to jumpstart a Volkswagon Thing with the testicles of a horny dying cow. Somehow on some other planet those times qualified as \""guitar solos\"", even being a Rage fan, I still don't know why or how. Matt Cameron can play circles around Brad Wilk. There were so many times I was left saying \""WTF\"" how is he able to pull this off and the song stay together, when listening to Matt and the odd beats signatures on \""No State Actor\"". Timmy C is nothing compared to Ben Shepard. This isn't to say Audioslave was bad.. I liked them. But real fans of Soundgarden would admit, Audioslave was Soundgarden Lite.<br /><br />When it gets to the forth song \""Thousand days before\"", things start breaking down a bit. I couldn't help but think that the song sounded like a Janes Addicition rehash. I couldn't put my finger on it the first time through, but then I started thinking that Perry Farell could sing this song and it could fit perfectly on the B-Side of \""Ritual de lo Habitual\"". Being that I'm not much of a Janes fan anymore, I normally skip this song.<br /><br />The 5th song, \""Blood on the Valley Floor\"" is OK..<br /><br />I normally skip 6,7, and 8, mostly because I don't really dig them all that much. Nothing new that grips me and shakes me. Bones of Birds is OK at best and there's nothing new and exciting on Taree and Atrition. They don't really grip me all that much.<br /><br />Where I get back into the album is the song \""Black Saturday\"". It's not on the same level of depth as songs like \""The day I tried to live\"" or \""Fell on black days\"", but it's still really good and a song that was needed on the album. Something slower and darker but really listen-able at the same time.<br /><br />The next song, I have no idea why it ended up on a Soundgarden album. \""Halfway there\"" sounds like Kim, Matt, and Ben were locked out of the studio and Chris Cornell invited Weezer to take guitar, bass and drum duties. It does not fit on the album whatsoever and with ANY of Soundgarden's catalog. I hope Chris leaves this kind of stuff for albums where it actually fits, like another solo album that doesn't feature Timberland. ;-)<br /><br />The remaining three songs are good, nothing really noteworthy to write home to mother about, but they're still good.<br /><br />All in all, I will say it's probably the best rock album of the year thus far. It brings one back to the time when music was music, a time when Justin Beiber's parents still had the opportunity to abort him! I hope Soundgarden continues to make really good music and helps bring back the Alternative Rock/Metal/\""whatever the heck Soundgarden qualifies as\"" genre.<br /><br />One last thing, someone on here was complaining about the lack of depth to the lyrics on this album compared to other albums.. To you, remember that \""Kickstand\"" was a song that Chris wrote about his male appendage and \""Full on Kevin's Mom\"" was well.. about a friend of Chris's sleeping with another friend's mom. Get over it.<br /><br />Thanks, I hope this helps others out there!<br /><br />For a band just dusting itself off from a long slumber, I give it an A-.<br />The album itself if held to other Soundgarden, Audioslave, Black Sabbath, and Led Zepplin albums.. I'd give it a solid B.<br /><br />Thanks!",2012-11-17,710,extra_long,2012-11,music

The Quicken team seems to have solved the issues. I use the mobile app on both my iPad and Android smart phone. The syncing works well and online/ending balances match desktop Quicken. Even the issue with Wells Fargo has gone away. The Desktop Quicken is faster to update and seems to require less bandwidth. I have Hughesnet sattelite for an ISP and when previous versions of Quicken were updating nothing else could be done with the internet until it finished. So something seems to have been made more efficient.<br /><br />pdate January 4, 2013. I am upping this to 2 stars. I was contacted via this review by Quicken and eventually we made contact and spent a lot of the time on the phone. Much of my original review below in regard to Wells Fargo was a completely unrelated glitch exactly at the time I was installing and trying to configure Q13 and Mobile. So WF now works and syncs to the cloud and appears properly on the mobile app (Android Jelly Bean 4.1 on Galaxy Note 2). You have to sign in separately on the mobile app for Wells Fargo but that is not an app problem but a contractual requirement of WF with Quicken. I was told WF was unique in this regard.<br /><br />I was prepared to up my review to 4 stars but for the life of me I cannot figure out how to add a tag to a new transaction in the mobile app. You are presented with your list of tags with check boxes. But check a box and nothing happens. No \""Save\"", or \""OK\"" or anything at all. And pressing back on the device leaves the tag field unfilled in the transaction. So the mobile app does not do the ONE THING that I really wanted it for -- to enter transactions on the road rather than saving all the paper until I was in front of my PC again.<br /><br />If Ken, or someone else from Quicken could help with this entry issue I would appreciate it. I have searched the web and Quicken sites and could find nothing on this issue. Am I just missing something obvious?<br /><br />Twoother things that are just annoying: Quicken proudly announced in its latest release that it now reminds you to sync with the cloud before closing. That is another mouse click for me. I can see that some might like this but I could find nothing in settings that would allow one to toggle this off or on.<br /><br />The other annoying thin is in the mobile app. When you go to enter a payee it stops and announces that it is searching for local businesses. Again, this just gets in the way of what I want to do. I personally can never see me using it that way. But maybe. Again, I would like to be able to toggle that on or off.<br /><br />One more serious item: On the Android app you can toggle between online and ending balances. At least you can for checking and savings accounts. But for Credit cards what you see is online balance (good so far) but then the toggle shows you not your ending balance as you would see on your desktop version but your Credit Limit! Why? The assumption I guess was that one would happily go on charging as long as the online balance did not exceed the card limit. But I need to see, just as with checking, not only what the online balance is but what the balance is after my entries that are in the future.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Interesting pricing at Amazon. As I write this today Q Premium is sixty nine dollars. Just 6 days ago I bought it here for fifty eight. I went ahead with the purchase as I thought with so many really, really negative reviews there was a good chance that mostly things were going ok with Q13 but when they went bad they went really bad so maybe I would be one of the lucky ones. Did not happen.<br /><br />I had none of the conversion problems mentioned in other reviews, all my data converted fine. But the point of buying this update is the mobile component. I have had so many different problems that I cannot even troubleshoot them. Just when I think I have figured out what is going on some completely different thing raises its head. For example over the last several days in trying to get the mobile syncing to work correctly I have activated and deactivated my Wells Fargo accounts a number of times. I get \""error updating account\"" on the mobile gadget sometimes, sometimes not. No more information. Over three days the reactivation of my accounts from the desktop Quicken with Wells Fargo resulted in a \""Direct Connection\"" established which I do not want because WF charges $3 a month for that. Q desktop then reports that I can change the connection to \""Express Web Connect\"". Ok. But then I have to call WF to cancel my Direct Connect so I do not get charged three dollars. I have had to do that five times so far. On my most recent activation yesterday Quicken finally did as it should and asked me upfront if I wanted Direct Connect or Express Web. It appeared to work ok with Wells Fargo. But in doing a standard update in Q desktop my checking account updated fine but my savings account does not because of error-CC-800 the solution to which in the help screen for the error has no relation to my situation.<br /><br />Earlier I was getting alerts on both the desktop and mobile versions that Wells Fargo wanted more security information. But no path on the mobile device led to a solution. Today, even though I am getting this CC-800 error for my saving account I tried syncing the accounts to Q Cloud/mobile again. Checking works it seems but I get an error message on the saving account \""due to a connectivity Issue Quicken is unable to verify your password for this account\"" What?? I do not have a connection problem on my end. Does Quicken on its end? I don't know, and what does that mean? And what am I to do about it?<br /><br />Again today, seemingly successful in at least syncing my WF checking account to Q cloud/mobile, I check my mobile device and the Online balance on my iPod Touch is wrong by one cleared transaction and the Quicken Desktop \""Ending Balance\"" is not even close -- nor am I able to figure out where it came up with the amount it did.<br /><br />I started several days ago by using the Mobile app on my iPad. I could not figure out why I could see an Online Balance but no Quicken Ending Balance. I struggled with that for sometime, checked Quicken's support site and a nice rep called me back. There was no error -- The app for the ipod is DIFFERENT from the iPad app. The iPad app does not have a toggle to show Quicken ending balance and will show up in a later release. Was I somehow supposed to know that? I spent a lot of time on that.<br /><br />I really do not know where to turn for help. The problems are different each time it seems. Does syncing Q desktop with Q Cloud somehow effect the standard update between Q desktop and my financial institutions? I don't see how but I am not an engineer and it seems trying to get the mobile function going just messes up my standard Quicken Desktop operation.<br /><br />I see that Quicken reps have appeared here now and then and if one would like to get in touch with me and stick with me through all of these many issues and those that are sure to arise I would appreciate it.<br /><br />But other than that I do not even know what I would do if I tried to contact support and get asked, \""What's wrong?\"" Where would I start? It is just broken and the mobile function has no use to me at all and the desktop version is acting up anytime I try to get the mobile going. And I am tired of calling Wells Fargo and asking them to again cancel my \""Direct Connection\""<br /><br />I am retired so I have had the time to spend on this. And although I am not an engineer I consider myself a high end lay user of things technical and have kind of a hobbyist interest in it. But this has taken up even too much of my time and my interest starts to wane when I can see no path at all to resolution. I think I will just give up on the mobile aspect until I see new releases on both the Desktop and Mobile versions.<br /><br />I have great sympathy for those of you out there with full days and just want a product that increases your productivity rather than diminishes it.<br /><br />P.S. Just checked the mobile app on my iPod for Wells Fargo checking: \""Error Updating Account\"" Sigh...",2012-12-07,1548,extra_long,2012-12,software

They ignore him and do it anyway, thus encouraging the wrath of Mehemet and especially Kharis aka the Mummy. Stephen Banning, the father of John Banning (Cushing) is the first victim, losing his sanity and being placed in a retirement home. He regains a bit of it 3 years later, warning John that the Mummy is coming to kill all of them for opening the tomb of the princess. But Banning Sr.'s fears turn out not to unfounded as Mehemet Bey has come to England and reads the Scroll of Life that unleashes Kharis and carries out the Egyptian's orders to destroy the archaleogists who dared entered the tomb of Kharis' beloved.<br /><br />John's father is the first victim, as Kharis breaks through the bars and crashes through the window of his padded cell and without mercy, strangles him. John's uncle goes next as the mummy rips apart the doors of John's house and likewise chokes the life out of him.<br /><br />John is to be the third and last victim, and the mummy very nearly succeeds in killing him but is stopped when John's wife Isobel enters and Kharis sees her as the image of his beloved Anaka. When Mehemet orders Kharis to kill her, Kharis rebels against his Egyptian benefector and instead kills him and carries Isobel off. He carries her deep into the swamp, but fortunately, John and the police arrive to save her. Surprisingly (or maybe not) Kharis lets her go when she tells him too. But Kharis himself is destroyed in the end with the Scroll of Life in his hand after being shot down, he slumps into the swamp.<br /><br/>This is my favorite version of the Mummy and in my opinion is the best. The 1932 version was okay, but it's not the kind of movie I'd watch over and over again. And the Hammer version definitely beats the newer Brendan Fraser versions by a long shot....they may have better effects but were real short on the emotional depth.<br /><br />Again I say Cushing and Lee are brilliant as always....you can't help but feel sorry for the mummy when he sees Cushing's wife...even with the muddled bandages covered all over him you can see the pain and longing in his eyes. And I loved how Cushing was just bating Mehemet Bey when he was somewhat confronting him (both very subtle like at times and outright daring in others) about his beliefs in the Egyptian religions and his disdain for archaelogists who go out opening tombs of those who are long dead.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with Cushing and Lee or with director Terence Fisher who also directed them in The Curse of Frankenstein, Horror of Dracula and The Gorgon.

US,12610035,R2RIX2RVFCR2OS,B000FBFHMK,20411936,Operation Gatekeeper: The Rise of the “Illegal Alien” and the Remaking of the U.S. – Mexico Boundary,Digital_Ebook_Purchase,1,1,4,False,False,Operation Gatekeeper,"After reading this book it will be clear (as it was to me) that the Author is an Open Border zealot (IMHO).  Trying to blur the line between LEGAL Immigrants and the Illegal Aliens.  That Operation gatekeeper was a failure is a joke.  Operation did exactly what it was designed to do.  It forced virtually all the illegal alien crossings to the East.  The 2 fence system took a long time to be put into place mostly because of the \""Tree Huggers\"".  Once the 2 fences were in, the \""traffic\"" in the areas in and around the San Ysidro Port of Entry, San Ysidro, California was forced to move to the East.  This area is a lot more rugged as well as forcing load vehicles used by smugglers to travel roads away from areas where they can blend in with daily commuters.  The smugglers began charging more money for taking people across.  The areas being used were also patrolled by border bandits that would rob, rape or take these groups of Illegals.<br /><br />Operation Gatekeeper slowed the traffic  in those areas where 2 fences were emplaced.  However, the attack on agents did increase due to the frustration the smugglers were experiencing.  Also, when President Bush and Tom Ridge first announced their Amnesty proposal, the agents began seeing groups getting larger and attacking the second fence with every type of ladder imaginable.....as well as some that were hard to imagine.  The attacks on agents increased as the promise of amnesty became more of a possibility due to the announcement from the POTUS.<br /><br />They have since added razor wire along the top of the secondary fences.  However, they did not use enough rolls and or tangle foot as suggested by the US Military.  The camera systems also helped to cut down the number of illegal crossings in the 2 fence areas.  Gate Keeper allowed agents to be sent to areas still being hit hard by smugglers as well as those areas seeing an increase due to the huge success of Gatekeeper.<br /><br />San Diego Mayor(s) and Police Chiefs took all the credit for the HUGE drop in crime in San Diego \""proper\"" as well as the areas in and around the border.  We saw housing areas spring up along the border as well as a large outlet mall.<br /><br />As for the huge traffic problem at the Ports of Entry in San Diego, that is due to the US Customs and Border Protection OFO command.  They are forcing the Customs Officers to allow Mexican Nations who are crossing using their Passport/Visa (B-2 Visitor) as well as their Border Crossing card and attending San Diego schools.  The Customs Officers all know they are entering for a purpose that is a lie.  That their true purpose is to attend US Schools, which makes their entries illegal.  They are using documents to enter for a purpose other than declared.  Also, the bulk of the people crossing into the United States from Mexico are LAPRs.  They are Resident Aliens who are required by law to reside in the United States.  However, they are living in Mexico (in violation of their status) and cross each day in the morning and reenter Mexico at night.  When confronted, they produce an electric or phone bill with their name on it along with a US address.  The thing is, their vehicles are shown crossing each and every day.  The license plate readers catch them entering the US and reentering Mexico at night.  These LAPRs, if they were forced to move back to the US or have their status changed to that of a Commuter Alien, the times at those Ports would drop drastically.  Thus, allowing the OFO Officers to do a more thorough inspection of the people and vehicles crossing.<br /><br />This book is not a true depiction of Operation Gatekeeper.  To suggest that it was a failure is false.  You can ask any agent working the \""dreaded X\"" in the areas where the 2 fences were emplaced.  This book should be placed in the fiction section.  God Bless the brave men and women of the US Border Patrol, the US Customs and the Army National Guard who helped secure and control large portions of our southern border.

We haven't used Quicken for a few years and decided to go back to using it to keep track of our financial lives.<br /><br />The mobile sync is the reason we went ahead and purchased this release.  The wife and I miss the days of using Pocket Quicken and syncing information back to the PC in the house so that we could keep track of what we were doing outside the home.  With both of us now carrying smartphones and tablets, the new way of sync'ing seem to fit what we missed.<br /><br />But, it has been a major issue.  Not from having issues with duplicate transactions or split transactions being deleted or corrupted.  I can get the mobile sync to work at all.  I've just spent an hour on the phone with support (if you can call it support since Intuit is using folks out of India), and got no where.  All I was trying to do was sync a couple of bank accounts and a cash account.  The cash account worked fine.  Tried to add a couple of bank accounts and Quicken would stop responding.  Support had me going in a scripted circle of validating the data file, removing the cloud account, adding accounts back in.  The last step was to remove the cash account since accounts are suppose to be linked to a bank account.  Really?!?<br /><br />I'm very disappointed in this release.

I finally gave in tonight and watched the movie.  I hissed at the oh so evil character very well-played by Bryce Dallas Howard.  In fact, I'll take my hat off to her for  giving some depth to what could have been a cartoon.  She plays her as a sad person - which makes the harsh lines delivered to her in the denouement seem real - despite the fact that no African American maid in the 1960s would have EVER spoken such words.  In the world of The Help - the biggest threat to the African American community is the idiocy, bitchiness or callousness of the hoity-toity \""well-bred\"" white women.  This threat is swept away in a glistening fantasy of moxie that can rid The South of such pesky, foolish ladies.  This is because The Help teaches us that the combination of minority-underdog gumption and big-hearted white people trumps the \""backwards\"" ways of those callow racists.  Unfortunately, The Help teaches us one thing, and history teaches us another.  Mississippi still holds segregated proms.  And, back in the 1960s, showing such \""gumption\"" could easily result in death.  The worst The South had to offer its maids was much worse than the petty insults foisted upon them by narrow-minded bosses or by having to use a (yegads!) different toilet in the house.  While it makes me feel good to think those suffering ladies were surrounded in the cozy embrace of the daffy, loving White Trash bimbo who cleaves to her maid like a long lost sister, or the noble, curly-wigged liberal who risks not being popular or married so that she might bring equality to The South or that racist mothers dying of cancer both beat cancer AND become enlightened in a single moment --- well, I can't believe it once the movie stops playing.  In fact, what tasted like a chocolate pie while I was watching the film, tastes like Minnie's \""special\"" pie once the movie is done.  Let's be frank.  This book is fluff.  This movie is fluff.  We all like easy entertainment.  We like to curse our villains and root for our heroes and we all want a happy ending.  However, I think it's problematic when the ingredients for this confection are portions of history that are anything but sweet.  You can't write a feel-good tale of female-bonding between do-good white women and their African American maids.  You can't have your cake and eat it it too.  The book is a lie.  The movie is a lie.

Walter is an eccentric but amusing recluse in high demand for his ability to find anything. There were 13 episodes in season 1 before Fox cancelled the show. Here are the episodes names and descriptions per Wikipedia.<br />1. \""An Orphan Walks Into a Bar\"" - After recovering one of John Fogerty's (guest-starring as himself) beloved guitars, Iraq veteran Walter Sherman (Geoff Stults) helps a teenage boy (guest star Brett Davern) locate his missing father, a military pilot and war hero whose plane vanished after embarking on an undisclosed mission. Walter turns to Deputy U.S. Marshal Isabel Zambada (Mercedes Mas&ouml;hn) for insider information about the missing colonel, which links the lost plane to a high-level drug dealer and illegal cargo. But when Walter forms an unlikely connection with the missing father, he not only locates the fallen aircraft, but in the process, he and Leo (Michael Clarke Duncan) uncover the real purpose of the flight and help the teenage boy find closure. Meanwhile at the Ends of the Earth bar, owner Leo and Walter keep a watchful eye on Willa (Maddie Hasson), a teenager on parole from juvenile detention and employed at the bar as part of her probation.<br />2. \""Bullets\"" - Walter looks for the bullets that were involved in the murder of a police officer twenty years ago. Meanwhile, Dr. Lance Sweets investigates whether Walter is fit to participate in Federal investigations, he also assists Walter in his finding endeavors.<br />3. \""A Cinderella Story\"" - Walter's investigation of a missing shoe ends with a fairytale ending.<br />4. \""Swing and a Miss\"" - Isabel's new boyfriend Frank (guest star Lance Gross), an all-star baseball athlete, gets robbed, and Walter steps in to help find his stolen collectibles. But in the process, Walter learns Frank has lost something more meaningful than memorabilia. Then, to earn Willa's trust, Leo and Walter bring her in on the case.<br />5. \""The Great Escape\"" - Preston Miller (guest star Jonathan Slavin) is a magician who seeks Walter's help in finding his assistant who vanished after a failed disappearing act attempt. Alongside Special Agent Judy Green (guest star Ever Carradine), Walter and Leo find clues leading to a counterfeit money ring. Meanwhile, Leo enlists Isabel's help in looking after Willa.<br />6. \""Little Green Men\"" - The Jeffersonian's Dr. Jack Hodgins ropes Walter into searching for an 'Alien' Spacecraft that was seen and videoed by a pilot of an incoming Space Shuttle who is now dead (due to him not keeping quiet), thereby getting the other pilot, Col. Bradshaw's life back after he was discredited by a shadowy government agency. But all is not as it seems and Walter's life, family and friends face a very real threat from a woman code named 'Pope' (guest star Peta Wilson). Meanwhile Willa and Timo attempt to get their marriage arrangement dissolved by the notorious Uncle Shad. (guest star Eric Roberts)<br />7. \""Eye of the Storm\"" - The episode revolves around Hurricane Catherine, which is currently in Florida. The episode begins with Willa's probation officer coming to quickly inspect her living quarters at the bar; however she ends up having to stay due to the harsh weather. Walter, being his paranoid self, boards the bar up and calmly begins preparing to stay in, going as far as making punch and asking Isabel to come over. However, it all gets interrupted by a newsflash on TV about a missing girl. The hurricane forces Walter to find the girl while remaining in his bar.<br />8. \""Life After Death\"" - When a DJ begins playing new songs from a rapper who was gunned down ten years ago, Walter is hired to recover the music for the distributor. Walter instead decides to find the dead rapper despite all evidence of his death. In the course of the investigation, Walter learns more about the dead rapper's final moments, the origin of his songs, and uses this to help heal his still-mourning family.<br />9. \""The Last Meal\"" - Walter is asked to find a meal for a man and his wife's anniversary. However, Walter searches for the chef behind the dish and source of its unique, smokey flavor. The situation becomes more complicated when he and everyone at the bar ends up in a life or death situation between The \""Smoke Monster\"" (Lost reference) chef and a mob boss.<br />10. \""The Conversation\"" - Walter is asked by a young girl to find her recently-disappeared father. Initially uninterested, Walter determines the man had been talking with somebody else just moments after calling his family and sets out to find the conversation itself. Meanwhile Leo is depressed as the birthday of his daughter arrives and he once again contemplates his desire for revenge.<br />11. \""The Inheritance\"" - A friend of Isabel asks for Walter's help to find her father's killer. Walter refuses to seek him out, but eventually agrees to help--not to look for the killer, but to find an inheritance left behind for his daughter.<br />12. \""Voodoo Undo\"" - Shortly after a shoot out, a notorious crime boss seeks Walter's help but finds this job proves to be extra dangerous, primarily the reason he believes he is under a voodoo curse.<br />13. \""The Boy with the Bucket\"" - After discovering that a painting he found was a forgery, Walter begins the search for the original. However, Walter's brother Langston Sherman also shows up to bring him to their dying father, who tasks him with finding the love of his life, but there's one problem: she is in the Witness Protection Program.

Try Civ 4!,"Civ 5 is a pretty different game than its predecessors, and I applaud the developers for trying lots of new things.  But most of the new ideas are pretty half baked, silly, frustrating, or just boring.  Anyway, this review comes from someone who has played Civ 2, 3, 4, so I'll mostly just give my thoughts on the changes to previous titles.  Initially, the most obvious change is probably the switch to hex grids.  Besides looking a bit nicer than the old square/diamond tiles, they are a bit more \""fair\"" with movement.  By this I mean that each tile is the same distance away from each adjacent tile.  With the square grid, the diagonal directions are farther away than the cardinal directions.  Honestly, this doesn't really make too much of a difference in the game's strategy, but it's nice that the developers are fixing something that didn't make any sense to begin with.  But a more pertinent change in the map is that there's now only one unit allowed on a tile at a time.  Instead of having a whole bunch of units (or in the case of Civ 3/4, a few stacks of doom) moving around and capturing cities, it's somewhat more effective to just bring a few high level units and use them tactically.  To this end, it does add a bit more thinking to the mix.  But there are a whole slew of issues with it that make it really frustrating to go to war.  First of all, when moving your units between cities they constantly bump into each other and keep prompting you to issue them a new order, since they can't step on the same tile as another unit.  This is compounded by the fact that there's generally only one road between cities (roads cost upkeep now).  Also, after all the hoopla about the one-unit-per-tile change, the actual tactics involved with warring are sort of superficial.  Basically, (1) put your long range guys behind your short range guys (duh) and (2) don't enter the city bombard radius until you're ready to take the city (duh).  It's pretty funny that the AI simply cannot graspthese two concepts.  Legions will fall as the AI tries to send units at your cities one by one, or parks they're archers in range of your swordsman with no one blocking, or saunters their troops past a network of bombarding cities, which proceed to kill the troops one by one.  To really add some tactics to the game, I think the hex grid would have to be much higher resolution (think Advance Wars) and, obviously, the AI would have to actually know how to play.  New to the game are city states.  They're basically single city civilizations with whom you have some reduced diplomacy options.  I suppose they're there to give the world seem fuller without overcomplicating the game with extra civilizations.  But in implementation, they're bizarre.  Their core mechanic is basically: you give them money to gain their influence and they give you some kind of reward over time.  The possible rewards are food, culture, or military units; with the occasional resource thrown in the mix.  You can give them larger amounts of money for a 'bulk discount' on their reward.  If you don't ally up with them by sending them a check, and you trespass in their territory, they'll get angry at you.  However, being that they can only have one city, they'll never really do anything about it since they have no way of attacking your cities.  Also, they'll occasionally make grand pronouncements of a few varieties.  Sometimes, these make sense: they might have a dispute with another city state and ask you to conquer them.  But sometimes, they're just baffling.  They might ask you to come up with a great artist.  Not give them a great artist, mind you. Just, you know, have one.  Not only is this (for lack of a better word) stupid, but it also is pretty random.  Basically it just amounts to a random award of influence with a random city state.  I find the city states so uninteresting that I sometimes just conquer them (generally not to difficult unless they are being protected by a real civilization, which isn't really difficult to conquer as much as it is a hassle).  When creating games, I usually reduce their numbers or just turn them off.  The game has an empire-wide happiness score.  The purpose of this is to limit your city sprawl.  In practice, it just leads to micromanagement.  There's enough happiness producing buildings and social policies to manage pretty much any number of cities assuming you are reasonably careful with the happiness meter.  So you just have to watch the happiness meter and build some happiness buildings whenever it starts to get near 0.  But this really threw me off as a new player, since it punished me for conquering an opponent and taking their cities by suddenly have a miserable empire since my happiness meter dropped when I annexed the cities.  This is ridiculous, as it is essentially punishment for waging a successful war campaign.  Also, it doesn't make any sense logically.  Why would people in my capital become unhappy because I successfully conquered and annexed a city half a world away?  I can understand why they would be angry due to war weariness, but that's not why.  The happiness penalty comes when I annex the city.  Whatever the case, the happiness mechanic is too easily gamed and too frustrating to deal with if you don't know how to game it.  Tangentially related is the national wonder system.  To build a national wonder (which are generally overpowered), you have to have a certain building in every one of your cities.  This is really tedious because if you acquire a new city while building the national wonder, you'll have to switch production to something else until the new city builds the required building.  It's frustrating and encourages an absurd strategy (intentionally not expanding your empire until you finish a new building).  The new government system is rather interesting.  It's probably my favorite new feature of the game.  Throughout the game, you will accrue culture points, and at certain thresholds, you will be able to adopt a new social policy.  These social policies are organized into different development trees.  You can unlock some of the trees and policies within them.  The system is good because it lets you specialize your empire according to your play style.  It involves lots of high level decisions which are interesting to think about.  The weakness of the system is that there's no way to adapt your social policies at different times.  Overall, I like this system a lot compared with the system in previous Civ games (particularly Civ 4, where people playing a spiritual civilization would have no disincentive to constantly change their civics according to short term goals, other than the player's patience).  But this inflexibility in changing your social policies is symptomatic of a bigger problem with the game.  Simply put, it don't feel like you have much control over your empire.  For example, there are no research/tax/culture sliders any more.  Another example: if you enter into a research agreement with another civilization, it just rewards you with a random tech at the end of the research agreement.  Huh?  My guys didn't know what they were researching?  I understand that this is an abstract empire game, but that's just absurd.  Also, there are very few diplomacy options in general.  No map trading.  No tech trading.  No possible civic/religion influence.  The early game military options are pretty limited if you don't have iron.  If you have a big empire, there's no way to pursue a cultural victory.  If you have a small empire, there's no real way of pursuing any victory other than a cultural victory.  Everything feels artificially constrained.  Then there's the stuff that was outright removed from Civ 5 that were in previous Civ games.  Religions and espionage come to mind.  I personally really liked the way religion was implemented in Civ 4, and the way espionage was implemented in the expansion.  I would agree that there were some balance issues with the implementations of both of them, but it seems like the developers should have fixed them in Civ 5, rather than just axing them entirely.  I suspect the developers are saving these features for an expansion or DLC.  The interface changes are kind of a mixed bag.  -A nice new feature is the unified notification area on the right of the screen, but later in the game, it fills up way too fast and ends up just scrolling way off the screen.  Also, the game no longer prompts you with a bunch of pop-up windows at the beginning of your turn.  Rather, it just changes the end turn button into a contextual button on whatever action you need to perform before ending your turn (\""Choose Research\"", etc.).  This is a good streamlining of the system in previous Civ games.  -There's an info panel that you can swap out at the top left of the screen.  It can show science info, military info, etc.  It's pretty nifty, but I honestly don't really ever use it for anything.  -There's a strategic view of the map which switches the graphics to a 2d top-down view and makes things a bit clearer.  I really like this view as it makes things a lot cleaner and easier to see.  -The Civlopedia is now searchable, which is nice.  There's also a variable tutorial system with options for \""New to Civ\"", \""New to Civ 5\"", etc.  This is very cool and I wish more games would adopt this type of system.  -There are now 2 levels of advisors.  One level just basically tells you random-ish mostly-useless things like \""Our civilization is producing X science with Y population.  Now that's efficiency!\"".  For some ungodly reason the actual useful advisor screens are hidden behind a small button in a drop down menu.  These menus are similar to the ones in Civ 4, but they are not full screen and usually organized in a less functional way.  There are no big trade tables any more; you just have to scroll through all the civilizations.  There's no more civilization alliance web; it's now just a big list you have to scrollthrough.  These menus are still functional, but it's more work to look through than it ought to be.  -There's a general problem the game has with transparency.  Civ 4 would give you percentage chance of winning in battle.  In Civ 5, you just have some nebulous terms describing how well the battle will go.  Civ 4 would tell you exactly what is determining the AI's opinion of you.  In Civ 5, you just kind of have to guess.  Sometimes, you'll have a \""Friendly\"" empire denounce you.  This doesn't make any sense, and you're never clued into the game's logic.  -The automated workers are still pretty dumb.  I tend to try to minimize micromanagement whenever possible, so I really like to automate the workers.  They still don't really put down optimal improvements, but that's excusable.  What's inexcusable is the fact that, if you have cities on more than one continent, they'll try to sail back and forth between your continents all the time.  They'll sail ALL THE WAY over to the other continent to build a farm or something, then sail ALL THE WAY back to build a mine.  They'll do this constantly.  Sometimes, they get captured in the process.  As far as I can tell, there's no way to turn this behavior short of finding/creating a mod or something, or just manually controlling your workers.  -Then there are some minor nits: why does the game prompt whenever you're city can bombard an enemy?  In what situation /wouldn't/ you bombard an enemy?  It should just do that automatically.  Why can't you defer adopting a new social policy?  Sometimes I want to wait until I can unlock a different social branch, but the game makes me adopt some social policy I don't want yet, just to end my turn.  Why can't I update my video options while in game?  Why is it so hard to disable that intro movie?  Why do I have to choose the \""Enable build queue\"" option every time I load a save?  How come there are no victory demographics or anything at the end of the game?  Opinions might vary on the changes to the game play, but there are still plenty of technical issues with the game.  -The game's performance is subpar.  For record, I have a 2.4 GHz dual core x64 computer with 4 gigs of ram and a 512 Megs of video memory (GeForce 9800 GTX).  Not a top of the line computer, but this is a turn based strategy game!  I really wouldn't expect it to chug so slowly.  The graphics look pretty nice but run at like 15 FPS with the view panned back.  So I switch to the strategic view.  Personally, I really like this view, but if you want to view it with all the graphics on, make sure you have a beefy video card.  But even with the strategic views, the game runs horrendously once the map starts getting filled up with lots of cities.  It takes forever for the AI to take its turn, it takes forever for units to route themselves, it takes forever to load your save; all in all, it's just too slow.  -DX10/11 performance is horrible with my video card (which does support DX10).  DX9 still works okay though.  -The game is still pretty buggy (as of Jan 2012).  Expect lots of crashes.  -The online community and interface is pretty pitiful.  This is a pretty awful step backwards from Civ 4.  Civ 4 has easy buddy lists, (still!) crowded lobbies, lots of games, etc.  Civ 5 has very few people and lots of crashes.  There are usually only 1 or 2 games going on at a given time.  Then the bugs: sometimes, it doesn't let you complete your turn and you have to just quit the game (or save and reload).  About one time per hour, the game will randomly decide to reload while you're inside a game.  The game crashes, frequently.  Also, there are still the same-time-turns caveats.  Sometimes, you'll accidentally attack someone because they moved to the same tile you were going to move.  This is even worse than it was in Civ 4, because of the more tactical combat.  -When starting a new game, there are fewer options than there were in Civ 4.  There are less map options, less game options, etc.  -The mod community is pretty lacking.  Between this games release and now (more than 1 year), there's been very few new mods.  There's a built in mod browser, but it's really slow and glitchy.  The mod browser doesn't have any good way of sorting mods by quality.  There's a rating category, but it's essentially useless because it scores old mods higher than new ones because they had more time to get ratings (I guess).  So if you sort by this option, the mod list will never update.  Finally, there's a stale mood to the whole game.  This one is up to personal taste, but I much prefer the cartoony leader heads and bright graphics of Civ 4 to this.  The new full body leaders look good, yes, but are just way too serious for my taste.  Compare Gandhi between Civ 4 and 5 to see what I mean.  A lot of fun stuff is gone.  There's no palace to upgrade when your empire is happy (this was also missing from Civ 4).  Another example - Civ 4 had none other than Leonard Nimoy reading the discoveries!  Now there's just some anonymous voice doing it.  The wonder movies are gone.  Even the title screen is boring.  Civ 4 had a good looking rotating Earth, with a great song in the background.  Now it's just a picture of some palace.  In summation, Civ 5 isn't actually as terrible a game as all these reviews (mine included) are making it out to be.  The problem is its pedigree.  Between Civ 2, Alpha Centauri, Civ 3, and Civ 4 (I didn't play Civ 1), there was a steady evolution of a rule set of a core game.  Then Civ 5 comes along, tries a lot of new things, but the new changes don't have the decades of polish that the previous games in the franchise have.  So the game itself ends up as being shallow and boring after the first few games.  Whatever the reason, it's not worth your time - stick with Civ 4.",2012-01-21,2788,extra_long,2012-01,games

Because of that, there were parts of this book that thrilled me and made me excited to continue on to book two. There were also a few things that gave me some trouble.<br /><br />Though I loved the idea of the futuristic setting (the year is 2067), there wasn't enough world building for me to grasp the culture and social differences in that time, nor was there anything inherently futuristic in the technology or industry that I noticed. The existence of vampires and othernaturals wasn't enough to do it because of the very covenant that keeps the mortals oblivious to them. There were some mentions of locations, like New Florida, but without any frame of reference or explanation, there just wasn't anything to solidify the world in my mind. The futuristic setting ended up seeming inconsequential. Also light on definition was the vampires place among humans and comarr&eacute; origins and history.<br /><br />The Big Bad was definitely both big and bad, though. A real nasty piece of work there. I wish she was a little less clich&eacute;d in her motivations and edge-of-insane thirst for world domination, but there were a couple of unexpected twists, too. I love unexpected twists.<br /><br />I have to admit, the plot got a little confusing to me towards the end. And there were some things about Mal's dual curses that never made a whole lot of sense to me. Some of those plot elements could have been better-developed and more thoroughly embellished.<br /><br />Thing is, though, even when combined, those are relatively minor issues that could very well be cleared up in the next installment. They didn't detract all that much from my appreciation of this debut. More troubling was my reaction to Chrysabelle and Mal. I was over halfway through the book and I still wasn't loving either of them. In fact, at the halfway mark I was actually disgruntled by my disappointment in them as the main characters. I didn't find Chrysabelle sympathetic for her cushy century-long existence and I thought Mal was a pretty morose jerk. I warmed to them both in second half of the book, but my negative impressions of them in the beginning affected my overall enjoyment of their story.<br /><br />One of the most positive aspects of the book for me was that it felt very much like the start of a series arc the author has well thought out and tightly planned, as opposed to some that feel more like an initial overall idea that will meander a bit alongside and around each book's individual plot arc. I don't mind the meander in my paranormal romance series, but I prefer my urban fantasy to have a well-defined series arc that progresses through each book as the characters evolve and develop alongside it. If the impression I got from this book bears out in this series, I'll be a very happy reader.<br /><br />Oh, and one more thing.

My girlfriend and I were riveted in a 5 hour netflix marathon so much so we opted to pay for season 2 here.

Any brilliance was long, long gone.<br /><br />This season was full of stupid exchanges, manufactured drama, and completely drug out... an entire season at the farm?  In the end nothing redeeming and noting truly dramatic<br /><br />Just one example of the rediculous writing in this episode and the season for that matter...<br /><br />Rick and Shane... the dramatic climax of the whole season.  Ok they walk into the forest in open daylight, walk into the night almost instantly (obviously and very cheaply more dramatic) as Rick says they walk and walk, the whole stupid exchange happens and then the frickin kid shows up to see it.  Really?  He leaves the house full of people unnoticed and walks a long way according to Rick and just happens to find them and at the precise time to see Shane turn into a Zombie, save his dad, make a perfect shot at 150 ft, and become a man at the same time.  Okay bad cheesy writing and very lazy, but how about this.... even thoug Rick says they are essentially miles in the woods and this stupid kid finds them they turn and walk back and the house is a few hundred yards away. Competely pitifulwork here guys.  Then the gun shot and Daryl \""a tracker\"" doesn't notice and just walks inside the house.  1000 zombies are a few hundred feet away in the woods and dad and kid dont hear ANYTHING to alert them until they are right next to them.  They turn and magically see the lights of the house start running in that exact direction with the zombie hoard behind them and in the next scene they \""are cut off\"" and have to run the other way to the barn????  Did 1000 zombies alone not create enough drama that the writers had to put in this garbage??? Did the one writer go to lunch and not read that they were heading directly toward the house with an obvious clear shot and put this in?  How about burning zombies that have to be hit in the head to die...now they are afraid of fire and just stop coming?? Rick sets fire to a barn and goes into a hayloft?? Really he was never stupid and why now.... quite simply and yet again poor and lazy writing.<br /><br />I could go on and on... the rally point, the gas thing, no supplies, a fire at night, a car big enough for the group, Rick's speach... all pitiful displays of writing.<br /><br />Enough... like the Walking Dead writers I'm bored and ready to do something else tonight, but please please AMC stop this.  I really enjoyed season 1, it was brilliant, but we were forced to watch 13 painfully stupid episodes hoping for just a glimmer of what we all saw there and regardless of what anyone says it never materialized.  Simply in episode 113 or so of season 2 AMC finally found some budget for extras and had the zombie attack that should have hit the farm 8 episodes ago.<br /><br />I obviously care or I wouldn't have just wasted 30 minutes writing this, but if it is not fixed immediately in season 3 I will write this off as complete and utter crap and enjoy watching the brilliance of season 1 over and over to get my fix of what once was.... good luck",2012-08-06,640,extra_long,2012-08,videos

It was the ideal choice for anyone looking to get away from the standard grindy MMO.  It was a breath of fresh air that was well worth the one time price.    Fast forward to today.    Guild Wars 2 has done nothing short of a \""bait and switch\"" for it's casual/target market.    Here are the reasons I purchased the game:  [...]  and    \""Here's what we believe: If someone wants to play for a thousand hours to get an item that is so rare that other players can't realistically acquire it, that rare item should be differentiated by its visual appearance and rarity alone, not by being more powerful than everything else in the game. Otherwise, your MMO becomes all about grinding to get the best gear. We don't make grindy games -- we leave the grind to other MMOs.\""    -Mike Obrien, President of Arenanet    I purchased this game because I am a college student, employed, and have a life outside of my computer.  From their advertisements and statements, this game was suppose to be the MMO built for casual players.  Where one could walk away from for a period of time, then once they get back on, still be able to experience all the content.  Stats weren't an issue, legendary weapons were the EXACT same stats as exotics. As seen in the statement above, if someone wants to sink hours and hours into something, they get an awesome looking item, but it's not more powerful.  Regardless if you feel this is how it should be, this is how they marketed it.    So what did they do Nov 15th?  Implement a new tier of gear with more powerful stats, that are required in order to participate in deeper levels of thier new dungeon.      To provide a little insight.  ArenaNet has developed a new debuff called Agony which is in their new dungeon.  This can't be avoided by any other means but to have Agony resistance. To have Agony resistance, you must have the new tier of gear plus a new \""infusion slot\"".  Calculated out, as it sits today, it would take someone ~70 hours for one piece of gear.  On top of this, there are two levels of the new gear, one more powerful than the other.      So what is the outcome?  ArenaNet has created a gear grind / horrific powercreep when they advertised this game wouldn't have it.  They also introduced a mechanic to gate people out of content until they are forced to have this new gear.      The hard core players (locusts) who love this kind of content are also segregating the player base and not running the new dungeon with players unless those players have the best gear available.      This plus other shady practices ArenaNet and their NcSoft overlords has done with this game make me sick.  If you purchased through ArenaNet directly, and it's been within 6 months, you are eligible of a refund.  This however, locks out those who prepurchased the game back in April.    So what does it boil down to?    If you like WoW or WoW clones, you will love the direction this game is taking.  If you feel like you need to be superior to other players through stats and amount of time in the game, this game if for you.  If you feel like you need a constant grind for a few more stats, this game is for you.    If you are like me, a casual/dedicated player, this game was for you, but no longer.  If you can't keep up with the hard core players, you will be left behind.    If you are happy with this game as it sits and the direction it is going in, good for you, but the reason I'm now giving the game such a poor review is because it turned into something that it was never suppose to be based on thier advertisements.    TLDR:  Loved the game initially. After Nov 15th's new content, it appears to be taking a 180 on it's manifesto and initial advertising, which is the reason I purchased this game.  I don't want to spend hours after hours of grinding to be able to do all of the content.  I don't want others to have a statistical advantage over me just because they spend 10 hours a day on the game (aka remain competitive).  This wasn't how the game was advertised, it was marketed to the casuals and now it's just another failed WoW clone with a terrible gear grind.

It is masterfully centered around great abuses that ocurred to the Chinese immigrants who came to America in the 1800s, but the revenge for the abuses are being carried out now.  The movie involves the last member of a Swedish family, the only member to have accidentally survived the revenge of a Chinese man who is well trained with the sword.  Both social realities for how to see historical abuse are represented in the story.  It is a drama that is driven along with a tension of suspense, a suspense driven by when is she going to get it.  There are many questions a viewer will take from this thought provoker.  A question that I took away from the story is how independent should my family loyalty be in light of a government's design to have all people individualized into the government's mode of behavior as defined by the terms \""an obedient citizen\"".<br /><br />Women who enjoy watching women control the power position in social dynamics will be satisfied with this movie.

While I did find the theories expounded and broad sweeping generalizations open to debate.  The Human Family Tree is well worth the view. The National Geographic appears to be making some dramatic headway in its research on DNA; isolating specific DNA strands, microsatellites.  I think it is encouraging.<br />The Academy of Sciences, Biology as well as most funded educational universities have been funded by organizations linked directly to \""Scientific Racism (Rockefeller, etc) for much too long.  Much of this funding was aimed at dispelling any truthful investigation into Africa and humanity.  The National Geographic did a wonderful job covering this issue.<br /><br />This said, I find most documentaries provide only a superficial \""Out of Africa\"" theory, while intelligently insinuating the underdevelopment of \""Subsahara Africa\"" with a proclivity of endorsing the racialized view of modern evolution as being represented in all of it's glory, as the paradigm of excellence of Anglo Western modernity.  We instead get a \""fairer\"" picture of humans not too different from ourselves, in exploration of the land, challenging themselves and their environment, and trying to meet the basic demands of life and security.<br />However politiocal and the social order of the day would like to reframe this issue.  The truth is undeniable.<br />Africa is home to the World.  Social constructs like France, Spain, America are terms that did not exist ages ago.<br /><br />The truth is that Europe is just 15 miles from Africa. Somehow scientist missed this.

We are all apart of the Human race or shall I say the Hamon race...<br /><br />Great documentary but with faults....  Scientific Racism is still cleverly hidden in the subtext and again the, heavy faulty assumption that demarcation lines that exist today, existed yesterday, with no visible impacts of minor & major migrations, or wars, or small intercinary conflicts which inevitably infuse the populace with new so called foreign DNA, is again...faulty reasoning imbued with agenda. All these ideas and the continued but implicit references to people as being black and white (which are colors not races) does lend this film to the archive of \""old age\"" thinking, political innuendo and agenda based television \""programming\"" most of us have outgrown. When the smoke clears it seems its always about protectign that sacred part of Scientific Racism proposed and that is the uniquness and difference of a supposed \""white gene\"". Whther black, brown  or white or yellow skin ...We are one people.  This documentary echoes that sentiment but all while confering superiority  to \""modern\"" humans.

I would recommend this documentary and encourage others to take a more proactive stance of critical thinking, remembering that for each parent there are 4 grandparents, brothers & sisters that will marry and as the family tree grows in branches like the sands on the beach of a seashore, the numbers are incalculable.

I have been a fanatical Green Day fan since 1994, when I was 15 years old.  I have purchased everything they've ever put out.  Nimrod was my go-to album when I was at college in South Carolina.  American Idiot was the soundtrack to the years I spent living in Florida.  Green Day has always been there with me, and for me.  So naturally, I was VERY excited about Uno!<br /><br />When, \""Oh Love\"" hit the radios, I was taken back.  I didn't like the sound, didn't like the lyrics, didn't like anything about it.  I didn't worry too much though, because I actually didn't like the song \""American Idiot\"" much when I first heard it.  And that album turned out to be a masterpiece.  So, I reserved judgement, and jumped all over the album as soon as I could get it.  Oh, boy.... \""Oh Love\"" was actually a perfect representation of the album.<br /><br />Uno! is a muddled mess of Power Punk & Pop. Green Day has been transitioning into a straight up Rock band, with only very subtle, minor pop and punk influences.  They have evolved into a Stadium Rock band, much like Foo Fighters.  Bands evolve (usually for the worse), but in Green Day's case, it was for the better.  They went from being punk little kids, to becoming craftsman of beautiful, big time Modern Rock songs (and Top 100 smash hits), with anthems that you can bellow out, with all your hearts glee.  Uno! is obviously an homage to their past punk influences, but this time around, it doesn't work.  Why?  Because these guys are NOT punk artists anymore.  It's like a girl who used to be a sexy, gorgeous cheerleader back in college, trying to be just as sexy and athletic when she's 49.  It doesn't work.  And this album, this Power Punk/Pop sound, DOES NOT work for Green Day anymore.  Maybe it would have when they were still at that point of their lives, but guys in their 40's trying to be kids again is a flat out disaster.<br /><br />I hope Dos! is different.

My tax situation is not overly complicated, but I do have both wages as well as a small consulting business with some capital purchases amortized over time.  I started using the product after doing my own taxes manually for several years.  I found that one can do everything manually on your own, if you are willing to read all the appropriate forms and publications and instructions.  But it is very tedious.  When I first used Turbotax this gave me a strong background to see if Turbotax was picking up everything I had learned to do manually.  In short, I have found that even the deluxe version picks up everything and more.  The company has more expensive versions designed for my situation.  I am sure that those versions provide a more friendly way to evaluate the many options one has especially with a small business, for example.  However, the deluxe version covers all the necessary forms, taxes, and deductions as long as you know pretty much what is at issue.<br /><br />Turbotax carries over any information from the previous year as long as you continue to use Turbotax.  It calculates all the amortization values for my business equipment, and automatically incorporates them in the next year's taxes.  It allows one to download tax information from major banks and financial service providers directly.  (However, I note that, when it downloads the information from my provider, it does not include the adjustments on my state taxes to omit any income taxes on federal interest in my various mutual funds.  However, I can easily add them manually using the information mailed to me from the provider.)<br /><br />The format has gotten simpler over the years.  Basically, you can go through each section, one at a time, and have Turbotax ask questions.  The program responds depending on how you answer the questions.  You can also pick and choose from a menu at the beginning of each section (Income, for example), and go through each major category in that section, or skip sections that do not apply, as you wish.  I generally do the later.  Turbotax checks your forms at the end, and it seems to do a good job of finding errors.  I have found that you can even call up an individual form and make changes on it, and Turbotax recalculates all related forms based on your changes.  That is not normally needed, but I have occasionally run into something where I did that as a last resort.  For example, this year I downloaded information for my stocks and mutual funds.  For some reason, I got a payer listed in that download with a value of 0, and Turbotax kept including it on my forms and would not let me delete it in the regular questions section.  I finally went into the individual forms where I found one for each type of mutual fund.  I was able to delete that listing there, and it was subsequently gone from the forms and questions.  It would not have been an error since the value was zero, but I did not like it cluttering up my forms.<br /><br />There was one thing of concern this year.  I filed my taxes in mid-February after I got all my forms.  When I went to efile, Turbotax would not let me.  The program detected what it thought was a situation that prevented efiling.  I called Turbotax, and the agent was very helpful, identified the issue as a bug, and told me how to get notified immediately of the fix.  That ended up being good customer support, but I was disappointed that such a serious bug would still be present in mid-February.<br /><br />All in all, I find using Turbotax to be a reasonable compromise for me between doing everything manually and hiring a tax preparer.  I am confident I get everything that applies to me without any aggressive interpretations.  It greatly simplifies the filing process, particularly for data carried over from year to year with capital losses or amortized equipment, for example.  And it allows me to break out of the standard question sequence to address a specific item on a given form if I feel a need to do this.  I will probably keep using it because the cost versus time and grief saved is worthwhile.",2012-03-31,731,extra_long,2012-03,software

Three of his later orchestral works - all performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under three different conductors - are presented on a recently released disc on the British based NMC label. NMC Recordings `is devoted to the promotion and preservation of Britian's musical heritage through acclaimed recordings of music by the best of today's composers, performed and recorded to the highest standards.' This recording fulfils that aim with confidence. `The House that Jack Built' (2001) - conducted by Sir Andrew Davis - displays Elias' sense of drama in realizing the playground that is the scene for this work and skilful orchestration; there are references to nursery rhymes  through brief melodic fragments yet these are darkened through evocative timbres and orchestral colourings. This is an engaging recorded performance that highlights Elias' control of structure and orchestral sound. Elias' sound is distinctively modernist and British yet remains unique among others of his generation such as Anthony Payne and David Blake.<br /><br />`A Talisman' (2004) - conducted by Martyn Brabbins with the bass Tim Mirfin - was a Cheltenham Festival commission. The text comes from an amulet inscribed with Hebraic text - a gift given to the composer's mother. The text, as the composer writes in the beautifully presented liner notes, is not all translatable but for him `the amulet was, above all, an object of devotion and a heartfelt, passionate and most moving appeal for help.' The work is certainly passionate and the vocal line is never obscured in the delicately scored opening; the long fluid vocal lines and declamatory moments are powerfully sung by Mirfin. The trumpet is prominent in this work and as Elias writes in the notes `as the text is so dominated by angel names, I have given the trumpet, an instrument very strongly associated with Gabriel and other angels, a prominent part'. The work is structured to reflect the amulet and as such is in two sections. This is a colourful performance which shows Elias' characteristic skill at capturing real drama in his orchestral writing.<br /><br />The CD has a more recent orchestral work `Doubles' (2006) as the final work on the recording. This six-movement work - conducted by Jiri Belohl&aacute;vek shows much more of a darker and vibrant approach to orchestration and its writing is as virtuosic as the performance. The title refers not only to the doubling of the first three movements by the last but refers also to the French term `double' which referred to a variation in 18th century keyboard works. There are some beautiful sonorities in this work that demonstrates a penchant for solo brass and brass-ensemble timbres. The  consistency of the orchestral writing shows Elias has a soundworld that is unique and worthy of exploration. NMC's release is worth exploring, as is other works by the composer.<br /><br />-<br /><br />Steven Berryman is a composer and teacher working and living in London.

The Protectors have the ear of the king and they've cast a curse on the shape changers designed to slowly kill them off.<br /><br />Sashe is forced to consider her survival when a friend of hers is killed because her father refused to help the Protectors. She's slowly falling for the new boy, but she must choose whether she and her sister can stay with the shape changers with their dangerous future. Should they decide to stay, how will they protect themselves against such powerful enemies?<br /><br />First novella in the Protectors prequels. Set ten years before Promising Light and two years before Fire and Light.\""<br /><br />My Overall Thoughts/Impressions: Disclaimer: I read Promising Light first, so I had already been introduced to many of these characters.<br /><br />I absolutely loved learning more about Sashe, Sierra, Dar, Evan, and Seth. From the very first page, I was entranced by their stories.<br /><br />The story was mainly told from Sashe's perspective. Her voice seemed so real to me. That is one thing I love about Emily Ann Ward is the characters always feel so realistic. I always feel like I'm inside that character's head, rather than reading about a character.<br /><br />I loved seeing the budding romance between Sashe and Seth grow. The world Emily created was portrayed in a masterful light. I loved everything about this story. I loved the plot, the writing, the characters, and the relations between the characters.<br /><br />Sierra, Evan, Dar, Sashe, and Seth's interactions with one another were hilarious in some parts, heartwarming in others, and just down right entertaining.<br /><br />In my min mind, Emily Ann Ward is becoming synonymous with a good story.

Well, that's preposterous. I had my first crush in kindergarten.  Although it was on another kid, I later had crushes on adults - like most kids. The film actually does a good job portraying kids as sexual beings (which they are). Jan - Jerron's young friend -  loved looking at porn magazines and talking about sex. There was one moment where he tried to stimulate himself while wrestling with Jerron. Kids do these things.<br /><br />The issue of the soldiers and sex is also portrayed. At one point, they bring in women to \""service\"" the troops. One girl gets a \""farewell\"" gift from a soldier - and I believe she supposedly had a crush on him too. Another young girl appeared in a scene topless and crying; I am assuming she had been assaulted by one of the soldiers. It was war. These things happen. I am not excusing it; I am just saying that anyone with knowledge of human behavior shouldn't be offended by the film.<br /><br />There are some downsides to the film. WE don't get enough info about the soldier. Depending upon his age, this might not have been extremely taboo. Many kids ran off to the war. And without computers, it was not always easy to verify ages. There were a lot of 16 and 17 year olds in WWII. So, it is unclear what the age gap really is. I also wanted to know a little about the soldier's mental state. We know that the young boy is truly in full crush mode. But what does this mean to the soldier? His character is very one dimensional. I blame this on the writing - because the actor was good.<br /><br />I loved how the filmed married past with present (you'll have to watch to know what this means). These were probably the two most creative moments in the movie. Some of that creativity was lost during the middle of the film. I was also bothered that there wasn't enough info at the beginning about the relocation of the children. I figured it out. But I imagine some viewers were lost.<br /><br />Also, the movie spent a lot of time at the beginning building the characters of Jerron and his friend Jan. Suddenly, however, Jan is tossed aside for the soldier. I think they should have spent less time on Jan and more on the soldier. This would have given us more about his background. Instead, he is just a flat fantasy figure. In fact, had the romance been between Jerron and Jan, the movie would have been far more interesting - simply because we know more about Jan.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good film. A lot of kids long for relationships like this with adults. MOST adults stay clear of them. The kids' desire doesn't neutralize the exploitative nature of these relationships. It makes the analysis somewhat more complicated, but it is still exploitative. I would give it a 3.5 - but since I can't - I have rounded up to a four.<br /><br />Finally, I have read so many reviews that argue that this film wouldn't be made by Americans or is supposedly too horrific for American audiences. Please -- give me a break. You must distinguish very expensive Hollywood productions that are designed for general audiences and that are indeed SUCCESSFULLY MARKETED AROUND THE WORLD with smaller independent films -- like this one -- that are viewed by more select audiences.

I'm not use to reading books from mostly a male's prospective, but Arson was a very interesting character. Though his life was hard and it made me mad over the things that happen in it, I did enjoy reading this book. A big flaw is that it shifts between character perspective too much. It would have been fine if it was mostly from Arson and Emery's perspectives, they are the primary characters, but they also told the perspectives of Arson, Emery, his grandmother, and Emery's mom and dad. I was just not interested in all those characters perspectives, I just wanted to focus more on Arson and Emery.<br /><br />Arson's life isn't easy. His grandmother loves to beat him, he has a boss that doesn't know anything about proper hygiene, and there's a who won't give him the time of day. Added to the mix is the fact that he can light fires (go figure, his name is ARSON, as in, illegal lighting of fires), nothing is going well in his life, and multiple times he wished he could just die. He is a good person, I can see that, but at times he listens to the words people call him. I think if people would trust in his own words more he wouldn't feel like the way he does.<br /><br />Emery is the new girl in town, and she's a bit odd. She wears a mask everywhere she goes, not wanting anyone to see her face. This only makes people stare at her more by her wearing that mask. Even I would stare if I lived in that world. She wears the mask because she doesn't like how she looks, and shes's not brave enough to face the direct stares from peope looking at her physical flesh. She hides behind her mask to believe everything is okay and to act brave. She has a huge sarcastic streak that is a bit funny at times. There are times that she talks to Arson without the mask, showing how brave she really is.<br /><br />Arson's grandmother is a bit weird. One minute she's like anyone's grandmother all nice and gentle, and then her expression changes and she's calling him a wretch and flung a plate at him. I can't help but despise her for what she does to Arson, for hitting him for things he can't seem to understand. She tells him she loves him the most, but turns around and beats him. You know something's wrong with her and so does Arson, but your just not to sure till the end.<br /><br />I loved this book and how supernatural it was, although this book doesn't have to much explanation on Arson and why he can do the things he does. This seems like a set up for a sequel to me. However, the book almost seemed like Emery's story, as it talks more about Emery and what's going on her household than what's going on to Arson and his. This book takes place mostly where Arson lives and at his work. He lives by a lake and spends a lot of time in the water, which is how Emery finds him. The town is small so that everyone knows everyone, Emery also describes it as a dull town. It was sad to learn of how Arson grew up with his grandmother and the mistakes he has done in the past. Many bad things happen to Arson, but I like how he and Emery interact with each other when she's introduced. Their relationship evolves from being sarcastic towards one another to actually liking each other. Arson tries to help Emery deal with her problems, while trying to keep what he can do a secret. This book will leaving you wanting to know what will happen next and it's a good thing.",2012-08-03,652,extra_long,2012-08,ebooks

Although different building design software packages present a number of individual features, they also share quite a number in common.  I'm judging this software from that perspective.  First time homeowner users could be perfectly delighted with this software.  However...if you don't mind slapped together, sloppily-written and edited instructions that show menu displays that do not exist despite days spent clicking around on every icon I could see to find such menus, then buy it.  If you don't mind designing a house floor plan with their \""House Wizard\"" feature, saving it, reopening it and finding you're unable to delete a room or edit the layout, then buy it.  If you don't mind trying to design a kitchen without a ready-to-go list of generic appliance images -- no, you actually have to search for them from a Library menu and download a catalog (r u kidding me?), then buy it.  And get this -- when I used House Wizard to create a kitchen, I actually had to remove a wall -- or I presume create a doorway -- in order to move the appliance image into the kitchen!  I guess that was done to accurately portray reality.  I could go on.<br /><br />Verdict: This software is has some considerable flaws.  Hopefully they were eliminated in newer versions.

CNBC misrepresents what is being said in the memo's and draws lengthy inferences based these misrepresentations. They interlace these deceptions with emotional appeals based on a fathers dead son. I didn't count how many times they refer to the \""dead son,\"" but it's often. It's important to note that not a single piece of evidence exists that the son was killed by a defective rifle.<br />#1: There is no questioning of the motives or credibility of any person or company other than Remington. Why are these people pointing a loaded firearm, with the safety off (on or off it should never be done) at a person? This is nonsense.<br /><br />#2: That 78 Memo<br />Walker doesn't say in that memo that the Model 700 is unsafe and thus they should change the name of the safety on the 700. The memo from a meeting says the word 'safety' is misleading as \""a gun is only as safe as the person handling it.\"" CNBC skipped all this and lied about the intention and origin of the document.<br /><br />#3: The 82 Memo<br />Again CNBC picks and chooses what they want the memo to say. The full paragraph states: \""Please don't bring out a new bolt action, without a fool proof safety which is capable of BLOCKING THE BOLT. Make it at least as good as the PRESENT M/70. BETTER IF POSSIBLE.\"" What CNBC says and what the memo says are different things. Walker also advocates for cheap guns made \""as simple and plain as you can make it with a price to match.\""<br /><br />#4: \""Theoretical Unsafe Condition\"" Memo<br />You can look this memo up on cnbc's website, it describes a possible unsafe condition, the proposal to fix it and concludes \""this change with be included in the drawing as soon as tool procurement is completed.\"" In short, the problem was identified and fixed on the drawing room floor. CNBC flat out lied about what this memo said. This also undermines CNBC's conclusion that Remington \""has known since the 40's.\""<br /><br />#5: The \""20,000 Susceptible Guns\"" Memo<br />Remington 1) only tested guns built prior to 1975, and 2) found that 2 out of 200 (or 1%) could be \""tricked\"" into firing. No matter where you learned to do samplings 200 out of 2,000,000 is not an accurate sample. Remington tested their competitors guns and found they, too, could be \""tricked\"" into firing. Further, 0 out of the 500 returned post 1975 could be \""tricked\""  This flies in the face of CNBC's position that it is the design of the Remington 700's safety that is causing the problem.<br /><br /> #6: Remingtons Response<br />I can tell you from expertise: you would never release a statement to CNBC that stated \""plaintiff's attorneys have not been able to reproduce this problem\"" if that wasn't true. You'd be digging your own grave.<br /><br />#7: Deposition of<br />They purport to have Laura Watson saying that \""under certain conditions absent a trigger pull\"" the Model 700 will misfire. CNBC wants you to believe that is her admitting it will misfire. If we look at the \""form letter\"" you can find Remington acknowledging these conditions; none of which would be the fault of Remington. These include: modification of the trigger, excessive lubrication inside the trigger assembly, foreign material, or improper adjustment.<br />Just fyi: class actions law suits are a gold mine.

This particular accentuation might seem inventive on first listen but they seem merely to call attention to themselves, not to contribute to an understanding of the work. Particularly annoying are overdotting (evident even in the opening) and the capricious changes in dynamics and tempi, especially at transitional moments.<br />* Almost absurdly heavy-handed for an \""original instruments\"" ensemble.<br />* Despite the oddball dynamics and tempi, the sonic profile is oddly flat. The trumpets have no dimension. It takes a while to notice this because the idiosyncrasies of interpretation give the impression of a fuller sound.<br />* I love Bernarda Fink and have enjoyed her contribution to this work under other conductors, but she sounds haggard here.<br />* No improvisatory ornamentation or variation, whether in the da capos, the ritornelli, or in the obbligato instruments. This was commonly done in Bach's time and more and more historically informed performances allow for this. If done well, it sounds completely organic and in keeping with the spirit of the work. While I wouldn't normally \""ding\"" an individual performance for not adding these flourishes, under Harnoncourt it certainly intensifies the foursquare, joyless impression.<br /><br />The peculiar thing about this work, perhaps with Bach's choral masterworks in general, is that you are actually better off going with a littler-known choral conductor steeped in this tradition than with a big-name orchestral conductor like Harnoncourt or Chailly.<br /><br />I don't like Harnoncourt in general, granted, but I have given this recording more than a fair shot. I am familiar with more than 40 performances of this work and this is pretty far down on the list.<br /><br />Wonderful performances can be had from: Schmidt-Gaden, Gardiner (1 on DVD, 1 on CD), Herreweghe, Biller (2 recordings), Dijkstra, Otto. I have only heard parts of the Koopman but it sounds beautiful if lightweight. If you're an Elly Ameling fan, as I am, you might struggle choosing among the three recordings featuring her -- the Münchinger can be dismissed out of hand, the Ledger recording would be lovely if it weren't for Fischer-Dieskau and Tear (who needs a Monostatos-tenor for the Evangelist?). This leaves us with Jochum and a wholly satisfactory suite of soloists (Ameling, Fassbaender, Laubenthal, Prey) ... it's a little plodding in places but spiritually and musically cohesive.<br /><br />Given my (ahem) prejudices, you might think I'd be offended by a pre-HIP conductor like Richter (or, rather, he was right on the cusp of this movement). But his recordings -- particularly the 1965 with Janowitz, Ludwig, Wunderlich and Crass -- are wonderful. He might be a little deliberate in pacing and the choir rather outsized but the performance has clarity and cohesion.<br /><br />The emperor has no clothes. When will listeners wake up and realize that his reading of this work is self-involved and joyless? It offends me that this guy, with his ability to attract major soloists, probably sells 100 times more copies than Biller and Dijkstra combined. Meh.",2012-10-13,562,extra_long,2012-10,music

In order for this software to be successful (actually applicalble rules for any software, I think) these criteria need met;<br />1) Does Office 11 on my Mac work almost seamlessly with documents created on my or another's PC in that systems Office software?<br />2) does the software take advantage of the system coding and structure (in this case Mac OS X) to deliver functional, user friendly results?<br />3) all else failing, is the software customizable to a large enough degree that it will be able to accomplish the required tasks (tasks natively supported on other versions of the same software) essential for your or your business's/organization's needs?<br />4) and lastly, is the software accessible, i.e. is it easy enough to use or train yourself to use functionally.<br /><br />Sadly, 1 & 2 are not universally true, 3 is a 'it depends' and 4 - well it has a ton of features and that requires work to get a handle on, and the structure is a little more Mac specific than Windows specific (which I can't argue with) so it takes some work and a little bit of relearning some tasks but this is just a necessity and there is good documentation out there, so I don't score any points against it for 4.<br /><br />Some background on my uses of the program. I have a small business. Part of my taskings and services offer me up as a linguist where I use multiple languages, some in right-to-left Arabic and/or Asian scripting as well as standard European and Cyrilic writing styles. I often have to be able to transfer seamlessly between the different languages even within the same document, on occasion in the same sentence, and sometimes this means collaborating, proofing and editing a file worked on by a colleague on their system which may be running a Windows based version of Office.<br />My difficulties are that this is mind-numbingly tedious and cumbersome to do on the Mac Office 11 software. Thedocuments I am reviewing often fail to carry over the language specificity of certain document sections so that when I create new text in the target language it often outputs incorrectly, illegibly or even uncomprehensively.  I could open the same file on a Windows version of Office and not have this problem.<br /><br />In fairness, iWork software isn't really functional in this area either. Arabic script often presents itself disjointed or incorrect. Sometimes certain Dari text is made illegible or whole sections are corrupted. Fortunately Office 11 preserves the structure and style of the original document keeping it legible. It's nearly when you begin revising that document, adding or modifying text, that the issues arise.  Also, Apple's history of support for multi-language support is itself been very poor, but has dramatically improved in the last two major OS releases and is very strong (though not perfect) today.  But, it isn't an excuse for this software to be buggy in this regard, especially since I've painstakingly configured my Mac to function seamlessly in all necessary languages.<br /><br />Ah, but there is the rub!  Taken from a review on appleinsider.com \""text input within the Office suite fails to work with modern Mac OS X features such as its system wide auto text substitutions, corrections, transformations, dictionary and thesaurus; you'll have to configure these features in parallel both in Office app preferences and in Mac OS X System Preferences to have things work somewhat consistently between Office and all of your other apps, because Office continues to roll its own unique text input system and reference tools\"" [...].  What does this mean?  Quite simply, I have to customize Office 11 separately to offer better language support and for each language I want it to support and in some cases for each document I want it to extend this support to!  Not only this, but there is no, none, ZERO support for Middle Eastern languages such as Dari, Arabic,Hebrew, Pashto, etc.!  What a freaking pain and and unnecessary hassle, and in some cases, a crippling blow to the functionality of this software!  Hence my rationale for saying that my earlier point 3) - is it customizable - was answered \""it depends\"".  It is customizable, just not universally so and not to a truly useful degree.  In fact, for me, it means this product was a complete waste of a purchase.<br /><br />Now, you may ask why ever buy this over the iWork versions of word processing, presentation and spreadsheet software which is much cheaper?  Well, Office, even on a Mac, is so much more powerful and all the basic features are still there.  Excel formulae and data handling are much better than Numbers and the transferability of documents from PC to Mac, in this regard, is seamless in my experience.  PowerPoint presentations are easily produced and exchanged with the more powerful animation abilities intact on the Mac Office version.  It is mostly just when it comes to multi-language support that this sucker falls apart!  It's better than iWork, but that's like saying my dull, rusty hatchet is better for cutting down a 20 year old Pine than is a sharpened stone chisel.  I'd still rather have a freaking chain saw!  Office on Windows is a chain saw and Office 11 on my Mac is my rusty hatchet, just no getting around it.<br /><br />There are other transferability issues - Macros, VBA scripting, some stylistic template layouts that don't port seamlessly from Windows produced documents to Mac Office accessibility and modification.  These are, in my opinion as equally frustrating.<br /><br />So, in summation, you have to ask yourself why you're buying this software to begin with.<br />- Is it just because you want to be able to open your friends/colleagues/etc. .DOCX file - your better off getting a converter for cheap or free and sticking with iWork.<br />- Is it because you like the Office word formatting features and you only work in English with simple layouts and form designs that have no VBA scripting?  Well this will likely work for you, but than you might as well just learn to use Pages at a quarter of the cost and see it's almost every bit as capable in those regards with only minor hiccups in porting to and from Word.<br />- Is it because you have a need for Excel spreadsheet designs?  VBA Scripting?  Business capable presentation designs?  Yes, this will be a life saver.  This is why you must buy Office 11.  Numbers seriously won't cut it for you if your a serious spreadsheet user, and fortunately, I've found few hiccups with performance or portability on between Mac Office and Windows Office files.  And you'll need this if your handling any VBA, you just do (minor problems in portability aside - annoying but manageable, much more so than the text language portability issues).  And Keynote is just lacking compared to PowerPoint in some areas (I even have it on some authority that even Apple prepares their presentations on PowerPoint as opposed to Keynote for their product unveilings - at least it wouldn't surprise me if this were true).<br />- Do you use multiple languages, especially non-indo-european languages?  STEER CLEAR!!!! get a copy of Parallels or VM or just set up a Boot Camp partition, or something on your system and install Windows and a Windows version of Office.  This may cost you $350 - $400 compared to the $90 this Office 11 for Mac would cost, but it will likely be worth it to avoid the headaches I've mentioned.  Sad but true.  It's what I do, and I count my $90 purchase a waste.<br /><br />Basically, all the great things about Macs sadly seem to still be lacking in simple business world usability.  It's like there's some gentleman's agreement between Apple and Microsoft that they will always give me a need to keep a version of Windows installed somewhere on my computer.  *sigh*",2012-02-23,1334,extra_long,2012-02,software

I have done enough programming to know what is possible given the resources of Intuit and the amount of time Quicken has been developed.  I use quicken for tracking my bank account, credit card transactions and investments.  I also keep track of some personal assets and liabilities.<br /><br />I was basically happy with Quicken 98 and Quicken 2000, but recent versions have been little more than a tweaking (or breaking) of the existing user interface and features.  Every three years I have updated out of necessity because my investment updates stop working.  Every time I ask Quicken the same question and receive the same answer.  The only way to \""subscribe\"" to the investment update service is to buy the current version of the program.<br /><br />Quicken 2012 is noticeably slower than Quicken 2010, and more difficult to use because of the menu rearrangement and renaming of traditional buttons.  For example \""Enter\"" is now \""Save\"".  Some people obviously like the changes, but they hardly justify the price of a completely new version.<br /><br />Still glaringly absent from the program is any way to adjust the font size of non-register text, or the size of the other display elements.  As displays increase in resolution, the dots-per-inch scaling of Quicken has not been changed, nor has the user been given any option to set that.  I am now 51 years old and I am finding things more difficult to see in Quicken.  If you have vision problems, Quicken may not be for you.  Yes, I know all the tricks for changing the DPI of the Windows desktop, but Vista and Windows 7 allowed programs to be \""DPI aware\"", so why isn't Quicken?  Windows 8 could be a real problem for Quicken because it departs even more radically from the traditional 96 DPI scaling.  I don't recommend buying Quicken 2012 with any expectation of using it on Windows 8 and later.<br /><br />The investment register still behaves completely different from the other registers, and appears to be grafted onto the program as an afterthought.  For example, if I change the date sorting order, the dialog jumps to the oldest date, no matter which order I choose, or which item I had selected. Entering the price, shares and total price of a stock transaction requires me to click or press enter twice.  Once to re-calculate something I already entered (of the three) and another to actually enter the data in the register.<br /><br />The file name dialogs still do not remember previous folder paths well, and the reports annoyingly insist on tacking a 1, 2, 3, etc. on the end of report names. The features that have been added to the program over the years, all use a slightly different style of dialog boxes and options, making a complex process for navigating through the program.  Some things require going through three or four menus or buttons.  A great example of that is updating the price history of a stock.<br /><br />In short, it seems that nothing but cosmetic changes have been made, and all the previous shortcomings have remained.  I notice that the \""one-step-update\"" still takes three mouse clicks to perform.  When I check the box for \""Show this dialog only if there is an error\"", the extra dialog box still always displays when there is no error.<br /><br />I stopped trying to report bugs to Intuit a long time ago.  Either they won't or can't fix the bugs that have been in multiple versions of the program.  The few times that I have called Intuit support about Quicken have been a waste of time.  Intuit has fixed some bugs, obviously, but those seem to be only the most severe and those that don't require any serious investment of time without financial gain.  The fixed bugs are usually those introduced in the latest year's version rather than less serious bugs that have been around for a long time.<br /><br />I can't comment much about bugs in the 2012 version because I haven't encountered any new ones yet.  There are probably some long known bugs that I just ignore out of habit and don't notice anymore.  Based on my past experience with Quicken I waited until well into 2012 to buy the 2012 version.  I made the mistake of upgrading early last time, and the first four releases of that version were plagued with bugs.  You can investigate the budgeting complaints about Quicken 2012 and decide for yourself about those.  I don't use budgeting in Quicken because it has never been that great.<br /><br />If you aren't using Quicken yet, I encourage you to look at other programs.  Quicken does some things that other programs can't, but the other programs may be a better choice when you don't need those extra features.  Also, be prepared for bugs and limitations that may hamper those extra features now or in the future.  Quicken has a poor track record with bugs, and the forced upgrade every three years means that one can't avoid all the new bugs.<br /><br />I like a lot of what is in Quicken, but I haven't seen any major improvements in the program since around the turn of the century.  If you are expecting a program that will continually be improved, Quicken is not the one.  Quicken changes very little, but has a few new colors or rearranged menus every year along with a few new bugs.  As possible alternatives to Quicken I recommend Ace Money and Money Dance. If budgeting is your primary concern then You Need A Budget is worth a look too.<br /><br />A bug I've just discovered is that one can't search for \""WriteChk\"" in the action field of the investment register.

I'm glad I didn't pay for it.<br /><br />This short book starts out with a disconcerting \""dream,\"" which the author seems to be using to try to give the reader some characterization and backstory. No, Emma is not at home in England with the family, she's waking up in a blizzard on the trail in Wyoming. Apart from a few malfunctioning flashbacks, the whole story is just days slogging through snow in inappropriate clothing. So many characters are listed it is impossible to keep everyone straight. Eleven children in Emma's family alone, and numerous unrelated men, woman, and children, none of them given anything more than a name, age, and country of origin.<br /><br />Lacking in plot, this book does nothing to create any sense of empathy in the reader. The pioneers plod through the snow, Emma ponders how cold and dirty and hungry they all are, and the men dig mass graves in the frozen earth as more poor souls die.<br />And no one ever says a harsh word to another. The dialogue is an unbelievable collection of niceties and declarations of faith and thankfulness.<br /><br />This is not to demean the Mormon struggles or their faith. I just felt the author did a poor job of realistic portrayal. These people end up sounding like cartoon characters. The reader gets tired of the repetition of cold, snow, dirty, hungry, exhausted... but no worries, it's not far to Zion now, aren't we lucky to be God's chosen people!<br /><br />Once a rescue mission arrives, and after a marathon amputation session, they still have 700 miles ahead of them, crammed into wagons--those who kept their appendages suffering frostbite--but this is mainly ignored. (700 miles in a wagon is a hard journey in the best circumstances.) They reach Salt Lake City and live happily ever after.<br /><br />There is material here for a compelling story.

There is a heavy burden placed on the musicians and back-up vocalists who provide musical fuel for Perry's freeform chants. The results - far from being a journey into into the wilder orbits of reggae - are instead disappointingly mundane. The tunes are nothing special; the musicians, while competent, sound ordinary; the riddims are dully repetitive; and Scratch's rants about chickens & vampires are just not up to scratch.

After the death of drummer Allen Shellenberger, the band found itself in a place of transition.  Switching management, record labels, and prodcuers, Lit took their time to work on this album before releasing it.  THE VIEW FROM THE BOTTOM feels rejuvenated -- it feels like the members of the band have been reinvigorated.  They have been out of the spotlight for a while, and this album welcomingly accepts that status.  Instead of trying to rewrite \""My Own Worst Enemy,\"" the band pushed forward to new musical areas.<br /><br />THE VIEW FROM THE BOTTOM is a straightforward rock album; it may be their heaviest to date.  Many of the lyrics here deal with dead-end relationships, but there's also a hint of optimism in many of the tracks.

I have collected since NFS Most Wanted (except ProStreet and Shift Series), I got most on Xbox 360 but I got Hot Pursuit and the Run on PC.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br />The Run features controls more similar of NFS Most Wanted to my opinion, it is hybrid of simulation and arcade similarlly to Most Wanted. While the main campaign can be considered short, as it simply long race from point A to B (San Fransico to New York), you do race through some easy to challenging roads, I think they should have added more roads to travel as simple driving on highway in straight line, to give it feel of staleness and same time most Cop Events to give it more feel of Running for your life. It does succeed in giving the Michael Bay style action and feel of racing like its end of world, but it is over too soon. You have quite a bit of selections of cars, while they are NOT customizable by parts, variety of kits and paint is available.<br /><br />Story:<br />A dude named Jack has gambling debt from some Chicago Mafia and needs to win the debt in order to clear his debt. Of course the Mafia will atempt stopping from winning the Run. I will not spoilers as the story does not contain anything fancy twist element of surprise or variety of characters to make the Run more engaging.<br /><br />*Extra - Soundtrack - I am big fan of good music in a video game. I believe music can affect the feel of gameplay significantly. Forunately the Run features an original soundtrack composed by Brian Tyler (Fast and Furious Series, and variety of movies). The music makes the game more exciting and there is inspired soundtrack by Various Artists, as always NFS team creates a very good soundtrack.<br /><br />Graphics:<br />The same tech from Battlefield 3 - Frostbite 2 Engine, You can expect quality environment graphics in shading and shadows. Unforuntalely the game doesn not run 60 frames VSync, it is capped 30. You can turn Vsync off to get higher frame. The visuals of cars aren't impressive at all, bland shading and lack of detail, it looks very shameful. I expected more high visual fidelity. Since EA is making Frostbite 2 as new standard for their games, we can expect future games to look significantly better.<br /><br />Multiplayer:<br />I played a little bit and found it to be quite laggy indeed so it must be running a very poor P2P connection tech. (I am playing Battlefield 3 with no lag or whatsoever) Otherwise it has great selection of race types with particular cars and Autolog brings great experience of making races more challenging by asking you to defeat a friend's lap times and so on. There are plenty of people playing the Run multiplayer, so you should find games with ease.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />The lack of customization, short campaign and boring story, makes it a just a ok or good game in my category.

Apparently every concert under music director Alan Gilbert is being turned into a download. I have no idea how successful the series has been, or the similar one from the Philadelphia Orch. American orchestras have priced themselves out of making more than a handful of recordings, and it would be a boon if the Web turned into a saving grace.<br /><br />Here from Jan. 5-10, 2012 is a concert centered around the Mahler Ninth, with a short work by Thomas Ades, \""Polaris,\"" as filler.  When the Berlin PHil. went on tour some years ago with Mahler as the centerpiece, Simon Rattle also combined it with some Ades. the new work on that occasion, \""Tevot,\"" which seemed to have something to do with Leviathan, seemed more interesting to me than \""Polaris,\"" which has nothing to do with guided missiles or the NOrth Star. It consists largely of a shimmering sound that updates the tinkling, twinkling sonority that Wagner invented for the Magic Fire Music at the climax of die Walkure, adding a lone singing trumpet lifted from Ives's Unanswered Question and any number of works by Alan Hovhaness. but Ades handles these textures beautifully, even if the overall result is musical wallpaper, and sitting through it comes effortlessly.<br /><br />The Mahler Ninth is a work that the Philharmonic has already turned into a download, in their complete Mahler cycle under Maazel, and for his part Gilbert has recorded the work with his other orchestra, the Royal Stockholm Phil. There and in this remake, he offers no real heights of dramatic contrast or even varied pacing as the complex opening movement unfolds. Like Seiji Ozawa, who couldn't seem to figure out what to say in the Ninth (this symphony appeared at his farewell to Boston, which was not a fortunate event), Gilbrt engages with the music's emotion by fits and starts. The great eruptions in the first movement are vivid but not wrenching. One hears a Mahlerian who is musically assured but self-contained. Simon Rattle's recent Ninth from Berlin (EMI) could be accused of fussiness, but it had more galvanizing impact than this reading.<br /><br />In the Scherzo there's enormous latitude for parody, irony, the clash of rustic and sophisticated (Rattle said of the two inner movements that this one exemplified everything Mahler hated about the country, while the Ronddo-Burleske exemplified everything he hated about the city). Gilbert is merely efficient. Perhaps that will satisfy some listeners, since he is \""positive,\"" as the British like to say about upbeat music-making. The Rondo-Burleske proceeds in the same vein, with lots of quick, efficient gestures but no menace or irony. By this point you will know where you stand abut the performance as a whole. Michael Tilson Thomas has won praise for his detailed, elegant, one-dimensional way with Mahler, and Gilbert seems to be on the same track.<br /><br />Happily, the finale begins with some real gravity and weight; at 25 min. it's two minutes faster than the Stockholm reading, which was a true Adagio and actually slower by a minute than Bernstein in Berlin (DG), who used slowness to express heartrending intensity. For the first time I felt that Gilbert was fully in Mahler's world. His control over the massed string section is impressive, with a full range of dynamics as the shadings of the long elegy are revealed. The sound of the Philharmonic MP3, making allowances for compression, is up to the Swedish recording, which was very good, and of course the New York orchestra plays with world-class skill.<br /><br />On that ground I can recommend the remake, but neither one comes close to being as riveting as the great Ninths on record.but self-contained.

In case of mistakes he remakes the recording as to the portion of music affected by the error(s). A slightly different procedure is employed when he records duos, since a metronome is needed to synchronize the additional track. He's a piano teacher and the recordings also serve educational purpose for his pupils. That's it.\""<br /><br />And now, Michael B's reply to \""Alf\"":<br /><br />\""[quoting Alf:] plays the piece on his digital piano digital piano, at a convenient speed\""<br /><br />Michael B: \""Playing into some form of MIDI sequencer/recorder, and presumably then speeds up the pulse rate of the MID[sic]-playback device? This is of course a form of MIDI-sequencing and thus IS a sort of `faked performance,' as instead of entering the notes/chords via a computer keyboard/mouse, they are entered using a keyboard controller. Therefore it is not live piano-playing, as any competent pianist could produce astounding recordings [sic, recte, \""of\""] the most difficult repertoire using this method. The results of such an exercise are not readily comparable to that of a live player, as is immediately apparent to any listener familiar with renditions of the same material by pianists able to play live at the written tempo. I am sure Signore Colombo is a good pianist, teacher and all-round very nice chap, but to use the word PERFORM, in the context of repertoire (recorded at `comfortable' speeds and then brought to tempo by artificial means), is not one bereft of ambiguity.\""<br /><br />[again quoting \""Alf\"":] \""In case of mistakes he remakes the recording as to the portion of music affected by the error(s)\""<br /><br />Michael B: \""It is well known that many/most classical studio recordings are edited in this fashion (one good version cobbled together out of a variety of `takes'), so this has been accepted practice for many years (since the technology has made it possible and practically undetectable.) It is very rare that a pianist's performance might be made up many thousands of individual notes and chords edited together, which would be the extreme example (but a comparable one) to that of entering information into a MIDI-sequencer at a reduced tempo for later reproduction sped up by electronic means. On a specific note, I wouldn't think it unreasonable to discover that a recording here (of a substantial and perhaps obviously sectional work) was in fact the result of various takes then edited together using appropriate software. In my view that would still be valid as the recording was essentially `live.'\""--end quotes.<br /><br />I would have no argument with Mr. Colombo if he were completely up front about his methods, but all he says about this on his \""mp3classicalmusic\"" website is:<br /><br />\""My name is Claudio Colombo.

Haven't tried multiplayer yet.<br /><br />The big \""thing\"" with this game is gravity control. It was used well in a few early levels where the entire level is turned 90 degrees one way or the other. Later there is a free-floating zero G section which I found a little confusing as to which way I was meant to proceed. I doubled back on myself a few times after getting disorientated during fire-fights. The game doesn't have a map feature.<br /><br />The AI partner is useful from time to time dealing with the cannon fodder, although in the boss fights tends to get shot to bits and has to be saved from death. Generally this leads to the player's death as you have to leave cover to revive your partner.<br /><br />Only 6 hours in and they repeated the same mini-boss battle several times. I think they could have come up with a different type of unit to fight instead of repeating the same one over and over.<br /><br />The controls are a little jarring (E to zoom?).

This was also the cheapest option.<br /><br />Installation:  Long and convoluted.  After downloading the package, H&R Block installed the personal and business products separately, and each has a different installation interface.  There was a separate Microsoft .NET installation.  Installation took about 15 minutes, and the overall experience felt bloated and inefficient.<br /><br />After all that - when I first started my return, H&R Block required me to download and install an updated version - another 5 minutes.  Then when I need to complete additional federal forms - more installation!<br /><br />User interface & functionality:  The product does little more than re-format the questions already on the various IRS tax forms.  There's very little coaching on how to answer questions - clicking on help opens the IRS provided instructions.  Many screens didn't even bother interviewing me - just had an instruction to open the \""Whole form\"" - forcing me to navigate through the IRS form and reference the IRS instructions.<br /><br />The final error-check gave me errors for missing forms - although the application had already determined those forms weren't needed.  I needed to manually delete the blank forms.  The error-check reported that I needed to answer a question Yes/No - even when No was already selected.  These false errors make me wonder about the quality of the error checking behind the scenes.<br /><br />The application has poor error handling and tends to freeze frequently.  For example, I deleted lines I didn't need on a 1120 worksheet, and when I deleted the last remaining line, the software just froze.

I'd never seen \""Pride and Glory\"" but I've seen O'Connor's films \""Miracle\"" and \""Warrior\"" numerous times and those are excellent, excellent films.<br /><br />\""Pride and Glory\"" is nothing special, sad to say.  It's the story of a multi-generational family of NYC cops torn apart by corruption.  There's not much original in that, but even an oft-told tale can be interesting if told in a compelling way.  But that's not the case here.<br /><br />The most glaring problem is with the casting:  Edward Norton and Noah Emmerich play the sons of Jon Voight, and good luck finding three other actors who look less convincing as blood relatives.  Voight's wife and Norton and Emmerich's mother in the film is at least partially Hispanic, too, but there are no traces of that in her kids.  [Jon Voight was a last-minute replacement for Nick Nolte, who bowed out near the start of filming.  That combination would not have been any more convincing than this one.]<br /><br />I like Edward Norton.  I think he is a fine actor.  I just think he was miscast in this role.  He can play \""intense\"" when he needs to but in this movie he looks like a little kid trying to act tough.  He also lacks the physicality one would expect in his character.  Voight, another very fine actor, is a bit uneven but I chalk that up to the script.<br /><br />Colin Farrell, however, is solid throughout the film.  In fact, what I found to be most interesting about this film was the casting of the supporting actors who surround Farrell.  Actors John Ortiz and Shea Wigham played antagonists to Farrell's characters in \""Miami Vice\"" and \""Tigerland\"", respectively, but play his partners in crime in this film.  Wink wink! One wonders if Farrell had a hand in getting his buddies cast in this movie (not that they'd need the help -- both Ortiz and Wigham have the goods).<br /><br />In all, though, \""Pride and Glory\"" is simply less than the sum of its parts.  Gavin O'Connor proved with his films \""Tumbleweeds\"", \""Miracle\"", and \""Warrior\"" that he can deliver a fine film.  It was largely based on those films that I took a chance and bought this Blu-ray even having never seen the film before.  But this film just doesn't measure up, in my opinion.  It's not a bad film per se, but it feels like a retread of earlier, superior works.  Recast it with someone other than Norton and maybe it would play a bit better.<br /><br />The director is very clear in the documentary feature that they had no completed script when they started shooting and that Edward Norton was a constant source of aggravation, especially given his tendency to go off-script, argue the script, or insist on doing re-writes.  The chaotic nature of the production took a toll on the picture.  The climax of the film plays like it was thrown together at the last minute (which I believe it was) and the final scene/shot in the film looks arbitrary.<br /><br />A hip-hop performer raps over the music during the end credits, but it is an inappropriate piece of music to rap to.

His exclusion from that seems deliberate.  And though the director never actually says out loud that he would prefer to never work with Edward Norton again, you can see it on his face and hear it in his voice.

Sonny Criss holds his own with Bird, but there is no mistaking who the master of alto is when Parker does come in on his horn.<br /><br />This is an informally taped jam session at the Trade Winds in Inglewood (a Los Angeles suburb).

US,49495388,RKQDGFN6GU4HI,B0040V4T8O,97283480,Medieval II: Total War - Gold Edition [Download],Digital_Video_Games,5,5,6,False,False,"Great game, but not without some slight caveats","I will break down this review into five parts:  (It will be quite a lengthy review, just a heads up, but I believe that this will be enough for most to make a decision for purchase)  1) Introduction/Snappy review  2) Turn-Based Gameplay  3) RTS Gameplay  4) Expansion Packs  5) Conclusion  1) Medieval II: Total War (hitherto referred to as MTW2) is a game which allows the play to take command of various European powers circa 1080 to about 1500. These powers include England, France, Holy Roman Empire (ironically it was neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire), Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Poland, Hungary, Russia, Venice, Milan, Sicily, Byzantine Empire, Turkey, Moors and Egypt. The unplayable factions are the Papal States, the Mongols, the Timurids (basically Mongol invasion with Elephants which comes later in the game), and the Aztecs. MTW2 is a refreshing blend of turn-based strategy and real-time battles to form an empire midst the chaos of the Middle Ages. In the turn-based portion, one can conduct diplomacy, move armies, govern cities, build forts and watchtowers, and prepare for war. When two armies meet, the player has the ability to control the troop movements to achieve victory, with corpses littering the battlefield, only reinforcing the bloody path of the player to victory. It is very enjoyable to watch two armies face. This is not a game which can be played in one sitting, but rather, needs constant attention over the course of days, if not weeks. Some bugs plague the game, but they do not detract too severely from the game, which fully deserves its 9/10  2) In MTW2, the turn-based gameplay is where the core of the game takes place. Perhaps as a first step, one must cover cities vs. castles. A city allows trade to flourish, and these are the economic centers of one's realm. They bring in large numbers of revenue, and cap at around 7000 (this was reached by a fully upgraded, so to speak, Antioch). The downside is the fact that they are not as easy to defend ascastles, as there is only one layer of defenses, as well as the best trained units cannot be bought here, with the exception of some beginning knight units (I am not considering Mailed Knights and Feudal Knights as \""Knight\"" units - that honor goes to units like Polish Guard or Knights, Chivalric Knights, English Knights, etc., which are vastly superior to Mailed and Feudal Knights.). These beginning \""knights\"" units such as the French Gendrames and Polish and Hungarian Hussars are valuable troops, and are only trained in the cities. Losing a city means decreased revenue and potential bankruptcy due to lack of funds. Castles, on the other hand, do not bring in as much revenue and cap at around 2500. Here, one can hire the best-trained units available to each power, and are much easier to defend than cities, especially citadels, which allows for a three-layer defense. Losing a castle means slightly decreased revenue, but the worst is decreased military capability, which can hurt in the long run. This is an enjoyable change, as it brings a sort of a dualism into the map - no longer is one simply training units in strongholds or only in cities, but in both, each with its own distinct advantages. This is a welcome addition to the series. Secondly, agents will be covered. There are six types of agents, Diplomats, Princesses, Spies, Assassins, Merchants, and Priests/Bishops/Cardinals/Imams. Diplomats let the player engage in diplomatic relations with other powers to forge alliances, trade rights, marriages, seek help in a war, peace treaties, map information, payment, tributes, etc. In general, the diplomacy system is rather sound, but there are some rather grievous errors. Upon enacting diplomacy, I decided to have an alliance and trade rights, and I was going to pay 1500 to sweeten the deal. They declined, and decided to pay ME 1500. However nice it is to get more money, should not they accept when I was the one paying? The alliance system is also rather misguided. I enacted an alliance with a country much weaker than me (I was waging war elsewhere), and three turns later, they break the treaty by blocking a PORT.... Let us just say that they did not last long. I find this to detract from the overall feel of the game - why is it that an enemy would do this, knowing that there was no chance of victory? It is a problem that has plagued the series, and I am unhappy that it still has not been fixed, so -.5 here. This is probably among the greatest of my contentions against the game. Princesses can also engage in diplomatic relations, but can also marry enemy generals, thereby bringing the generals to one's side. The negative is that fact that your princesses do not really show up all that often, so it is rather rare to experience such enacted marriages. Spies spy, assassins assassinate enemy generals, cardinals, or if necessary, the pope himself. Priests and Imams convert populations to their respective religions, thereby decreasing or increasing public content. Merchants allow for increased revenue, but there are not many places in which it is actually very helpful (slaves around Kiev and Caffa, Mines around Vienna, Ivory and Gold in Timbuktu - by far the best place for Merchants to expand, gold and ivory in Dongola, and the silk around Constantinople and Nicaea; other than that, nothing else is really worth it). The agents allow for various things to happen, and I am very happy with how things play out - large check here. City management is OK, but after getting the largest cities, squalor levels become rather unbearable, making one wish for the Black Plague (and it does come, and kills not only citizens, but your agents and generals). Adopting new generals is rather annoying, because they either spawn in your capital or with a faction leader or heir and then take a long time to send to the frontlines. I don't have too much of a problem with this because I can't find an alternative - it would seem silly to adopt someone and then choose where to have him spawn - that would destroy the realism. Moving armies is fine and the ability to build watchtowers and forts is really nice. I think that that is enough here.  3) When two armies meet, the player has the ability to auto-resolve, fight on the battle map, or withdraw. Assuming one fights one the battle map, one first has to set up troops in wanted locations. While this is usually a painless process, glitches exist; mainly the fact that after dragging a formation, and seeing the proper formation and letting go of the mouse to have the formation there, it never materializes, even though there is nothing blocking the path there. Annoying, but manageable. The AI fights as well as it can, but do not expect much of a challenge after about 5 hours of gameplay - then, one can take on very large armies and come out victorious with small losses. I routinely fight about 2000 on 2000 on very hard, usually losing less than 400 troops, while the other army was fully vanquished. The corpse-strewn battlefield is a nice touch - a reminder of the player's bloody path to global domination. The soldiers fight, and it is breathtaking to watch them stab, hack, and parry incoming blows, and absolutely disheartening when your General gets killed by a luck axe from a woodsmen (yes I had that happen - charged head-on, and completely destroyed the enemy unit, killing ¾, while myself losing one - my general... ). This is a game from 2006, but I wish that it was slightly more realistic up-close. While they do fight, there are times where there seems to be no contact, but a unit recoils as if struck. Also, the enemy AI sometimes stands still while being hacked by enemy troops, rather than fighting. These are not major contentions, but they detract enough from the gameplay to warrant a loss of .5. As a side-note, I am not happy with the \""historical battles.\"" The numbers are rather erroneous, and even the parties taken in them are flawed (e.g. Battle of Grunewald / First Battleof Tannenberg saw allied Poles and Lithuanians against the Teutonic Knights - in the game, it is just the Poles vs. the Holy Roman Empire). Since I don't play these (a)historical battles, I did not bother meriting a loss of points.  4) The expansion packs allow for the player to assume more roles as various factions in various continents (Teutonic Knights, HRE, Poland, Lithuania, and Novgorod in Teutonic campaign; Turks, Egyptians, Byzantines, Principalities of Antioch and Jerusalem in Crusades campaign; England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Denmark, Baron's Alliance in Britannia campaign; Aztecs, Mayans, Indians, Spanish Conquistadors in the American campaign). This is enough to keep even the most die-hard fans busy for a while. The hardest I would say is Britannia, especially as England - there is too much to be done and too little time. The easiest is probably the Teutonic - money flows nicely and no giant armies to surprise one as they show up in Crusades. The gameplay is similar to the aforementioned, just more focused, which I like. It is worth the $1 over the original game to get.  5) Overall, this is a highly recommended game for anyone with an interest in Medieval warfare and global domination. Get it now!  Pros:  -Great gameplay  -AI plays OK  -Fun and Immersing  -Beauty to watch the battles  -Need to think (at least for me this is a pro)  Cons:  -Diplomacy system still needs work  -AI plays OK (random general kamikaze charge into a spearwall....)  -Allies treat you like trash",2012-01-04,1633,extra_long,2012-01,games

I've been a fan since three dollar bill, and even though my musical tastes have matured since I was 14, I couldn't wait to hear the new album. I thought, Wes is back, Fred is older and surely his work will reflect that, and this is their last chance. I mean, honestly, unless this album is a success, I don't see how the band can continue. They went from being one of the hottest bands of the 90's to one of the most hated, and then, sadly, forgotten bands of the 00's.<br />  If only they had matured as their fans did.

Instead, they served up \""Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water Part 2\"" under the name \""Gold Cobra.\"" So why did I give this song 3 stars?

Along with my email client, Quicken is the most important software program on my PC.  So when I was notified today that Quicken 2013 was available, I went online to see what new features were available.  When I saw the availability to view my Quicken data on my iPad, I immediately purchased Quicken 2013 from Amazon (download), solely for that iPad capability.<br /><br />To my shock, only after purchasing & installing Quicken 2013 did I learn that the Mobile App capability does NOT work with non-US accounts.<br /><br />I accept that quite likely most Quicken users live in the US, with all their accounts being US Dollar accounts, and therefore this problem does not apply.<br /><br />In my case, I track 10 bank accounts & credit cards.  Of these, only 3 are US dollar accounts or credit cards, and these are only secondary accounts & card, rarely used, and not what I would view often on my iPad.  So the sole reason for me upgrading to Quicken 2013 for the Mobile App capability was useless and therefore a waste of my money.<br /><br />I must mention, though, that during the setup of my Quicken Cloud account, I was told that \""at this time\"" Quicken Mobile App support only works with US bank account & credit cards.  So hopefully Intuit are working on this limitation, and soon I'll be able to view non-US bank accounts & cards on my iPad. :-)<br /><br />I just wanted to post this review, so that anyone else with non-US accounts & cards are aware of this limitation.<br /><br />Having said that, the following are my impressions of the iPad App itself .....<br /><br />Overall, it's not great, but for a 1st release it's OK.<br /><br />When I open up Quicken on my PC, I have it set to show me all my (non-hidden) bank accounts & credit cards, along with my current balance for each.  There is no way (that I've found) to have my Quicken iPad App do the same on the opening screen.  It is possible, though, and takes just 1 finger press to call up that information, so I'm not complaining.  It's just that the initial display screen shows items that I never use, such as Spending by Category, Budgets, etc.<br /><br />A bigger issue with the Quicken iPad display is that when bank accounts & credit cards are selected, the display states that it's showing the \""Current Balance\"" in the top-right corner, but the amount displayed is actually the \""Ending Balance\"".  To explain, I have Quicken on my PC set to automatically enter in bills into my register 65 days ahead of time, so I can see at a glance any upcoming credits/payments/debits, etc.  In my desktop register, each entry shows the Current Balance on each line.  At the bottom of the register, both Current Balance and Ending Balance are shown.  In my case, the Ending Balance is irrelevant - only the Current Balance is of interest to me.  And I have my accounts list on the left side display Current Balance (the other option is Ending Balance, for those who prefer that).  But there's no option yet in the iPad App to select Current Balance to be displayed.<br /><br />Again, this is only the 1st release of the Quicken iPad App, so I'm optimistic that hopefully in the near future it will become more customizable.<br /><br />And hopefully soon the Quicken iPad App will support non-US bank accounts and cards.  Until then it's useless for me, and not worth my upgrade earlier today to Quicken 2013.",2012-10-05,612,extra_long,2012-10,software

Combat is turn based, but the action never drags. You never feel like you have enough time. And like in Civ (this game is also developed by Firaxis), your units can &#34;level up&#34;, gaining improved stats and new skills. Since the focus here is on combat, the RPG aspect of the game is stronger than in Civ and will appeal to RPG fans. However, unlike many RPGs where high level units become virtually unkillable, the strategy required in placing and utilizing these units in battle are still much more important than their stats. Mid-game especially, the units are extremely vulnerable and you might have to restart many battles to find the best strategy of dealing with enemies. Although only a handful of units compose the strike team used in each mission, game mechanics require rotating a large number of units in and out of your team, so balancing using high level units and training lower level ones is part of the fun and challenge of the game.<br /><br />Base management is also a challenging task. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is never enough money or resources to get everything you want, and figuring out what your priorities are is important to success.<br /><br />One small thing that I also appreciate - when a shot misses, the animation distinctly shows a miss, and when a shot hits, the animation shows a hit. This is something that's bothered me in a lot of other games where even when a shot misses, it looks like it hit and you see either the word &#34;miss&#34;, or you don't see the enemy HP drop. XCOM shows you the miss, rather than tell you in words or force your mind to override your eyes.

I might have to rave about this one. So, as you might guess it's a five star read.<br /><br />It was just like watching a movie, only better. From the moment I started reading it I felt like I could have been watching an old western. Only it was a western with zombies. It was so visual.<br /><br />Set in the old west, the novel begins as any western might. There's a crisis. A little boy calls to his sister for help. Immediately the sister drops everything and rushes to his aid. Little does she know, it's already too late...<br /><br />It's heart-breaking. It's violent. It's a western. With zombies.<br /><br />First off, the action sequences were superb. Be it on the cold unforgiving ground or in the back of a covered wagon, body parts flew and blood was splattered. True to a zombie thriller, there were scenes of dismemberment, biting and even ninja like zombie decapitation. In places it was just plain gruesome. Yet it all fit so very seamlessly into the western genre. There was plenty of gun slinging. Desperate shootouts and fingers poised on triggers. There were stone cold, poker faced death stares shared between characters and ...<br /><br />Ah yes, the characters. They were such personalities. Individual, yet timeless. And as the makeshift posse of zombie plague survivors forms, the reader gets  introduced to several of them.<br /><br />Elizabeth Storey is a hardened zombie killing cowgirl in search of her brother. Trace Munroe is something of a shiftless gambler with a talent for talking his way out of a situation. Both have secrets. Neither are very hard on the eyes. So when the two team up to further their own goals, it's not surprising when a complicated romance develops. The romance is developed slowly over the course of the story, but it's well paced.<br /><br />What amazed me the most was the author's ability to create images the reader can pull off the pages. I'm not saying there's an excess of description. On the contrary, the visual quality was created with a perfect use of tone and skillful choice of words. I was amazed. Well written and smooth, it's well worth every penny. I recommend it to readers in many age groups who enjoy a good story, a little humour, gore and romance.<br /><br />On a personal note, while I do enjoy a few zombie thrillers a year, my experience with westerns and cross genre novels has been more limited. Of course I have read the odd Louis L'Amour, and watched movies like True Grit and The Warrior. However, Wanted: Dead or Undead was just so much fun it really made me think. Could every genre be improved just by adding zombies?",2012-03-23,465,long,2012-03,ebooks

Or perhaps their lives are so miserable that Teen Mom actually does look like a step up.  If you ask me, however, raising a child by yourself (as is the case for most of these teen moms), struggling to finish high school let alone attempt college, becoming addicted to drugs (like Farrah apparently did according to her new auto-biography) or clinically depressed and suicidal (in the case of Amber) doesn't sound \""glamorous\"" at all to me!  This show makes me feel happy that I didn't end up like these girls.  You couldn't pay me enough to want to live their lives, and if they do get paid 60k a year, it's not enough to make up for all the suffering they'll have to endure thanks to their decision to have unprotected sex at a young age.  Fighting with some \""baby daddy\"" (as in the case of Maci) all the time looks like a nightmare.  Or losing custody of your own child and rarely being able to even see her (like Amber) doesn't sound like anything I'd want to aspire to either.  Clearly the people who think this show \""glamorizes teen pregnancy\"" and \""encourages impressionable teens\"" don't have very high standards for their own lives to begin with, or none of this would look even slightly appealing.<br /><br />And the statistics don't lie either.  Teen pregnancy in the U.S. is the lowest its been in years and that number has consistently declined since this show started airing.  If Teen Mom was making so many teens rush to follow in the footsteps of the cast, then the national numbers would be going up to reflect that.<br /><br />All-in-all, this is a great reality show to watch if you like reality programming.  The cast is interesting and the conflicts are frequent, after all, raising a baby when you're still just in high school is no picnic and I believe that is accurately demonstrated on this show despite what others claim.

The four vampires she is sent to train to take over from the previous guardians are also good characters but I felt I would have linked to have known a little more about them, perhaps that will happen in following books. I did feel that some parts of the book were sort of glanced over, for example the training could have been told in a little more detail. Then the action scenes were really good and well described in detail. I definitely finished the book wanting to know more, so I hope that there is more to come.  I liked the whole love triangle thing going on between Dawn, Sebastian and Ethan.

There are now \""hero\"" characters and you can equip them with items, so the game now has a mini inventory system.  I haven't seen any updates for a while now, so the game may be considered \""complete.\""  For the price it is surely a gem.<br /><br />The review is written the first week of release.

Should you buy it?  If you are looking at this game because you want to 4X game in a fantasy setting the answer is for $20 or less, YES!<br /><br />Many people cite Master of Magic as \""thee fantasy all others should be measured by.\""  I never played it.  My 4X history stared with Civ2, than Age of Wonders Shadow Magic (AoW:SM).  AoW:SM was my gem, and I will say Warlock: Master of the Arcane (Warlock) gets close.  First there are no separate instanced tactical battles.  Fights are pretty much exactly like Civ5.  The city building is like Elemental, which means, every building you produce takes up a tile, the space around your city is the limiting factor, every unit/building takes a certain number of turns to produce (there is no varying production).  You are limited by area to build (city growth) and for troops your upkeep costs (which can only be balanced by building certain buildings in your cities.  That is a unit may cost 3 gold per turn to upkeep, you can build (in one of your limited building squares) a market that will provide you with 3gold.  If you produce more troops that you can support you will eventually go broke.  In my opinion it works, at least in the early phase of the game.  There have been complaints the AI doesn't seem to abide by the same system, and also that players can reach pretty much levels of infinite resources later in the game.<br /><br />In additionto making units, when they level up you can pick a bonus much like in Civ4/5.  Also units can be enchanted (by casting spells onto them at the cost of magic), or be \""outfitted\"" with \""equipment\"" (for a cost of gold).  There is no \""crafting\"" or backpack or item inventory.  The way it works is once you build a foundry on a map iron resource you will have an option to click on a unit and click on masterwork armor pay 50gold and you're done.  It is more a perk than an item.  You can't transfer anything, and if the unit dies all your investment is gone.  You choice is pretty much spam units, or produce less units but buff them up.  Or work somewhere in-between.<br /><br />There are plenty of special locations on the map. They provide a bonus once you build upon them.  For example a silver resource for instance you can build a mine for extra Gold, or a silversmith for the ability to upgrade your troops resistance to melee and ranged damage.  I really enjoy the choice of two different buildings most times.  In past games it seems you pretty much only get one option of what to build on a resource node.  One issue is right now you can not destroy a building, so if you decide you want to change your choice later you can not.<br />Quests.  The games quest system if very similar to AoW:SM.  Instead of the spirits of War, Magic, etc, you of the Gods of Ardiana.  You get your basic, \""Build this\"", \""kill that,\"" \""conquer this.\""  Complete quests gives immediate rewards (not completing has a penalty), and in some cases a successful completion will affect your relationship to the corresponding  Gods.  Favor of a God can unlock extra spells and units, as well as a Victory pathway within the game.<br /><br />Magic.  Magic feels potent.  It can keep your troops alive or bring down your enemies.  Focusing on Magic research can lead to a Victory pathway.<br /><br />AI.  It does a decent job resisting the player but never really threatens.  You can also game the system once you learn the naissances of the AI behavior.  For example I let an AI faction that I was at peace with whittle (6 unit army attacking that enemy city for probably 10 turns ) another factions city down to no defense and then just ran in with my rangers and captured it.  The AI just slowly walks away, no fuss or complaint.<br /><br />Overall.  Warlock will likely scratch that itch that many gamer have felt since their beloved 4x fantasy game became too outdated.  Out of the box it plays much more fluidly and faster than elemental.  I've never felt the need to just pound end turn.  To me that means the game is fun to play, instead of just parts of the game.  For the price of $20 I would buy the game again without second thought.  The game is not perfect, there are bugs, but most don't affect gameplay.  Also some of the games features to me feel somewhat superficial (diplomacy, getting a quest to build a farm 5 times in a row, having an enemy attack your city every turn retreat->heal->attack again - this doesn't seem effect the output of the city at all) and some promised features that aren't available at all yet (multiplayer).  If these features were flushed out just a bit and the bugs taken care of, Warlock could very easily be a satisfying game even at $40.  As it is though I think the game is a very good entertainment value for the price of admission.  A demo is available on steam that gives a good representation if you care to try before you buy.",2012-05-10,988,extra_long,2012-05,games

Look elsewhere.,"GAMEPLAY ISSUES;<br />------------------<br /><br />-Game was made to be played with a controller: while you can bind multiple commands to a single controller button (sprint, vault and roll are all the same button with a controller) this cannot be done with a keyboard or mouse. No big deal? It wouldn't be if the default mapping wasn't so terrible: sprint is Left Ctrl, vault is E and roll is G... try to use all of those while in combat.<br /><br />-Game relies heavily on cover mechanic: If you where thinking about using bullet time, forget it. It is absolutely useless in this game. If you take cover, you can just shoot blindly and still win. You can also aim while taking cover, but curiously you'll end up dying a lot more if you do so than if you just shoot blindly until there's only 1 or 2 enemies left. The way to beat this game in Hard difficulty is: walk around crouching and find a cover spot, shoot blindly until everything is dead, repeat.<br />***My biggest gripe is that the over reliance on the Cover mechanic makes the game feel like Duck Hunt. You only move around in between fights and as soon as you find one you just take cover and shoot.<br /><br />-No quick save, but checkpoints: you do not decide where you want to restart the game, the designers already did that for you. Random headshots from opponents kill you, so when you start a level try and memorize where every enemy comes from, you'll die AT LEAST a couple of times because of random headshots (ie, you're taking cover while the enemy fires at you and suddenly you die) and you'll have to restart from your last checkpoint.<br />***The absence of quick save means there is no \""Dead on Arrival\"" difficulty setting. Another classic feature gone.<br /><br />-Concerning Bullet Time and Shoot Dodging: I may have exaggerated when I said Bullet Time is useless. If you turn on Free Aim, then the only way you will be able to clear the mini boss at the end of Chapter 12 is with Bullet Time. After some 3 or 4 headshots (yes, HEADSHOTS) he will die. While bullet time and shoot dodging were rarely used when you played the higher difficulty levels in MP1 and MP2, they were not USELESS. You could always shoot dodge and land behind an obstacle to take cover. Here, obstacles are too far one from the other for shoot dodging to be useful: if you try to run and then shootdodge you'll die to a random headshot, if you shootdodge without running you'll land in the open and also die. Answer: take cover, shoot blindly.<br /><br />Scripted Cutscenes: you cannot make them any faster, bypass them or do anything at all, you have to watch them. Always. If there is a cutscene at the start of a checkpoint and you died, you have to watch the cutscene when you start over. Always.<br /><br />STYLISTIC \""ISSUES\"" (these do not hamper gameplay but I just didn't like them);<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />-NO COMIC STYLE CUTSCENES! Come on, these DEFINED the Max Payne series. Rockstar did away with all the film noir atmosphere so all we are left with is an old, bald, Max wannabe who walks around making cynic remarks.<br /><br />-Weak plot: When you start the game you feel Max has no reason whatsoever to be in Brazil. Then they explain why he is in Brazil with a very lame reason: A mob boss is after him in New Jersey. Come on, this is Max Payne! Punchinello family? Aesir Corp? The Cleaners? Vladimir Lem and the russian mafia? I think you see my point. If you can wrap your head around him being in Brazil, the story is not that bad, I just couldnt wrap my head around it.<br /><br />---<br />All in all: if you miss Max Payne, go play MP1 or MP2. I think this would have been a decent game if it were not called Max Payne 3, but had another name and another character. It just does not play like Max Payne and the atmosphere does not feel like Max Payne. The only thing it has in common with previous entries of the series is that it has, at the time of release, cutting edge graphics.<br /><br />EDIT: Comments starting with *** are edited in.",2012-06-04,733,extra_long,2012-06,games

Fontenot's first novel is a clever, fast paced and extremely twisted psychological thriller. Drawing on her upbringing in a cajun household in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the author was able to clearly capture the essence and flavor of small town life near a bayou. Cleverly intertwining her personal passions of computers and blogging, she has created a unique and realistic main character with a intriguing and unusual occupation.<br /><br />Raya Landry, the main character is a freelance writer and professional blogger, who researches and investigates cold cases for true crime websites. While researching her newest cold case, Raya has a curious and disturbing flashback of a brutal and horrific slaying of an entire family. Discovering that she is the lone survivor, Raya embarks on a journey to solve the twenty year old homicide case, despite the possible risks of becoming the killers next target.<br /><br />Overall the book was a fantastic page turner that was very hard to put down. The characters were believable, yet a bit quirky at the same time, which kept the reader wanting to know more.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, each character was given its own voice and the reader was able to experience the world through their eyes. Especially fascinating is the killer's perspective. The killer is extremely twisted, diabolical, and merciless - toying with the victims and psychologically torturing them, before ultimately ending their lives. As often is the case, the villain has the most disturbing and compelling role.<br /><br />At the conclusion, the author leaves open the opportunity for a possible book two in the adventures of a true crime blogger. Looking forward to more novels from this impressive new author.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  I received a free copy of this book to write an honest review.",2012-10-31,297,long,2012-10,ebooks

It makes me cringe. I will give this one star for effort, because he sounds sincere in his lyrics. Other than that, this collection of songs is just nauseating.  The strength of the vocals must have been very poor because the engineer added an obnoxious reverb and echo effect that attempts to hide the flaws of his voice.  The first track sounds like the vocals were recorded first, then guitars mixed in without any type of chord progression, and finally drums were added as an afterthought, with random cymbals and snares that don't seem to match up with any particular tempo or rhythm.  It honestly reminds me of what my first 'garage band' sounded like in 1988 when I was in the 6th grade playing music for the first time, each person playing something completely random and without any logical song structure whatsoever.  Each song after this gets marginally worse, and by the end I am wondering if this is an elaborate hoax, designed to make Christian rock look even cheesier than it already does. Actually, it sounds like the whole album was improvised without any music being written beforehand. I am not sure what any of this 'music' has to do with saving the children (save them from what??), nor do I know why the 'artist' needs to use 5 names. The cover artwork seems pretentious and looks as if he is doing a Jesus pose, hopefully this will save all those kids from the dangerous high-voltage Persian rug behind him.

He covers all areas of woodturning, from basics of the lathe, tools, sharpening, and of course, turning.  I found the first part to be a bit pedantic, as he went a bit into the background of what makes a good lathe, dust control, sharpening.  Not bad material, but perhaps just a bit excessive.  All of that changes once the wood is chucked up and the lathe is spinning.  He does an excellent job of explaining HOW a cut is made, lots of very clear shots at various angles make it clear how the job gets done, what goes wrong, and how to fix it.   I loved the part where he turned an egg, had a catch at the very end, and then showed how you would simply rework it to fix it.  The section on facework and bowl turning was very helpful to me also.

I've enjoyed all of their releases even the experimental The Science of Things.  I was excited when I heard the news that Bush reunited.  When they finally released their first single \""The Afterlife\"" I was disappointed more than ever.  The song does not sound anything like Bush.  Not even a touch of that signature Bush sound.  After that song failed to impact I heard the news that they pushed their album release back a whole year.  I thought well maybe since that song was horrible they decided to scrap the songs they made for their previous titled Everything Always Now album.  Months later Bush came back and came back the right way with their excellent hit single \""The Sound of Winter\"".  This was the Bush I wanted to hear.  My anticipation definitely grew thinking that Bush really did decide not to go the route they were going with \""The Afterlife\"".  Unfortunately that wasn't the case...  \""The Sound of Winter\"" is one of the only songs that sound like the Bush that I have always enjoyed in the past.  \""The Mirror of the Signs\"" opens the album with The Science of Things type of vibe which is a decent opener but nothing compared to previous openers like \""Personal Holloway\"" or \""Everything Zen\"".  When \""All My Life\"" came on I was still confident that this album wasn't going to let me down.  However,they actually ended up leaving the disappointing \""The Afterlife\"" on the album for me to skip right over.  Also, songs like \""All Night Doctors\"",\""Baby Come Home\"", and \""Red Light\"" make me think I'm listening to Snow Patrol and The Fray, not Bush.  I don't mind Adult Contemporary/Pop Rock but these songs are not good for Bush but more suited for a Gavin Rossdale solo record instead. \""She's A Stallion\"" is definitely a skip-worthy  track because it sounds like a complete re-hash of \""The Afterlife\"".  The record seems to pick itself up for the first time since track 3 with \""I Believe In You\"".  Itbrings back a classic Bush feel with the melody and crunchy guitars in the chorus.  The only thing about this song is that it doesn't stand out much at all even if it is a bit catchy.  \""Stand Up\"" is a better song than the previous track and is still worthy of some listens as it is one of the better tracks on the album.  Much to my surprise was the song \""The Heart of the Matter\"".  Definitely one of the best songs on the album.  It would be a bad move to not release this one as a single.  The closing track \""Be Still My Love\"" is a complete snoozer compared to closing tracks off previous albums.  I'll conclude my opinionated review of this album by saying that I really wanted to hear a Bush album.  If I wanted to hear The Fray, Snow Patrol, or post-Dizzy Up The Girl Goo Goo Dolls I would have picked up one of their albums.  I'm not expecting Bush to make a record exactly like Sixteen Stone or Razorblade Suitcase, but I am expecting to hear Bush music.  Overall, this is a disappointment and I unfortunately see no song on this album replicating the success of \""The Sound of Winter\"".   Noteworthy Tracks:  The Sound of Winter  All My Life  The Heart of the Matter  Decent Tracks:  Mirror of the Signs  I Believe In You  Stand Up",2012-01-05,585,extra_long,2012-01,music

One statistic given in the book is that \""each day, the average person complains seventy times and has 45,000 negative thoughts.\""  Wow!<br /><br />This book was very inspirational.

Prometheus proved however, not to be an exception to the disturbing trend, and was in the end the biggest let-down of all! I suppose this was mostly due to the fact that the Director is one of my favorites, and the original Alien, one of the most enduring classics of both science fiction and horror genres.<br /><br />I'll just give you a brief overview (only brief relative to how long it could be if I were to really get into all the details) of what were to my eye, serious flaws:<br /><br />Many the characters behaved in ways that were impossible to explain. They were set up to be highly intelligent, but then proceeded to make unbelievably stupid decisions that resulted in their deaths - some of which, like Charlize Theron's, wound up being unintentionally funny.<br /><br />The alien technology seemed inconsistent, difficult to believe and in some cases uninteresting. There were rough-hewn stone hieroglyphics that operated crude-looking stone doors and projected recordings, squishy gel buttons and musical instruments that were used to fly the ship, high-tech holograms that seemed way beyond the technology present in the surrounding rooms, and unfathomable tomb/lab/temple chambers that seemed to have no function at all. The derelict alien horseshoe ship in the original movie was so intriguing - it looked biological, but was clearly also technological. When I heard Promethius was being made, I thought &#34;Oh cool, now we'll finally get to see how this bio technology behaves when it's functioning!&#34; It turns out that all the ribs and wind-pipes are just inert, interior decoration. Apparently this is just the aesthetic favored by the Engineers for their version of Star Wars corridor paneling.It isn't alive after all, so doors for example, aren't organic orifices, they just slide open like all the doors in every other sci fi movie - such a disappointing extrapolation!<br /><br />Much of the plot was convoluted and hard to understand. The Engineers needed to clear Earth of all it's disappointing inhabitants, and apparently the most efficient method they could think of was to bio-engineer a menagerie of nasty creatures over which they had no control, and send them here in a small fleet of ships. What if some of the Earthlings found a way to protect themselves from the alien invaders? Even if we are all wiped out, how would they then get rid of the new inhabitants that even in a controlled lab environment they can't seem to subdue? Is the Earth just going to be a total write-off as opposed to a reboot? Then there's the hidden &#34;invitation&#34; the Engineers left in all the ancient inscriptions - was this intended to alert them that we had become technological by our deciphering it and showing up on their doorstep? It seemed they had been watching us, and their attack had been well underway eons before this event, so what was the &#34;invitation&#34; really about?<br /><br />The surprises and twists felt a bit arbitrary to me. Why keep it a secret from the crew that Mr. Weyland was on board? In the context of the story, what does this buy the corporation? In the context of the audience experience, what does this buy the filmmakers? Why would the android infect one of the characters with alien spores when he has no idea whether or not the resulting creature could end up threatening the life of his creator/father/boss? Wasn't his mission to prevent Mr. Weyland from dying? What were they trying to achieve by bringing that Engineer head back to life? Were they trying to make it feel pain? A head can't talk without lungs, so they didn't stand to learn anything from it. Was it the black stuff on its surface that made it explode? The other engineers that died atthe same time, seemed to have intact heads.<br /><br />Then there were the counter-intuitive alien life cycles. A &#34;snake&#34; forces its way down a crew-member's throat, but then the big surprise result is: nothing! It was apparently just hanging out in the corpse waiting to jump out later and scare the other crew members. Another life form can turn you into a moody, slimy person with a fever and bad skin if you swallow some black liquid, or gestate in your womb and emerge as a giant face-hugger if transmitted second hand during intercourse. Still another turns you into a strong, homicidal, jumping zombie if you get sprayed with its acid blood. The linear life cycle of the original alien was so much more interesting, intuitive, shocking, frightening and innovative.<br /><br />Even some of the designs lacked that trademark Scott elegance. The weird pin-head alien at the end, in spite of the verisimilitude lent it by current technology, was far less beautiful, disturbing and memorable than the guy-in-a-suit alien in the original movie. The retro bubble helmets reminded me of an era of science fiction that was far more goofy than cool. The silly looking zombie guy who got the &#34;snake&#34; blood sprayed in his face was neither scary nor interesting, it just looked like a generic, gory Halloween costume. The old-age makeup on Mr. Weyland, although I've heard people speculate that it was a tribute to the makeup in 2001 A Space Odyssey, was way too hokey for a movie released in 2012.<br /><br />Much of the movie was stunningly beautiful to look at though, and for this reason I can't in good conscience recommend not seeing it. Additionally, I can almost guarantee it won't ever bore anyone, and the cast is for the most part, top-notch and compelling to watch. I should also say that if there is a sequel, and it certainly set us up for one, I will definitely go see it, although I probably won't be waiting for hours to be the first in line!",2012-11-28,1015,extra_long,2012-11,videos

Alas, this game was a serious disappointment.<br /><br />The artwork was excellent, and the overall plot was spooky enough, but the gameplay itself left much to be desired.  The items the player must find to progress the plot were well-hidden, sometimes too well-hidden.  In several scenes the necessary item was completely hidden behind something else so that it couldn't be seen.  How else to find it without clicking over every square millimeter of obscuring scenery?  And, of course, this brings about an excessive clicking penalty, which freezes the game briefly.  Maybe I'm impatient, but clicking on every square millimeter of screen to find a hidden object offers little entertainment value.<br /><br />Another annoyance--the hints were few, and frequently not useful.  In order to get a hint the player must find a little green doo-dad in the scene and click on it.  I was never really clear what the doo-dad represented, a piece of jewelry perhaps, or maybe an Egyptian scarab beetle.  Neither seemed to fit the plot, which concerned a Canadian girl going camping with her pin-headed boyfriend.  In any case, once a hint was acquired, it often didn't help.  For example, at one point the girl must repair the telephone in her parents' wrecked cabin.  I looked all over for a missing piece, about 15 minutes, then finally resorted to a hint.  Here it was: \""Fix the telephone so you can call for help.\""<br /><br />I really wanted to like this game, but it didn't get any better.

US,47989081,RLHOPPB0L6IS8,B0085SYSDE,511207169,Distant Star (The Reminiscent Exile Book 1),Digital_Ebook_Purchase,4,11,14,False,False,New take on the books as worlds theme,"Distant Star<br />Joe Ducie<br /><br />Enjoyment **** Plot *** Interactions *** Characters **** World ***** Originality **** Grammar **** Style ***<br /><br />With Distant Star, Author Joe Ducie has produced a book that is a cross between Jasper Fford's Thursday Next series, Cornelia Funke's Inkheart and Roger Zalazny's Nine Princes In Amber series. That's a good pedigree.<br /><br />Mr. Ducie has written an interesting and dense story that requires careful reading. It evokes Zalazny's style more than Fford's or Funke's.<br /><br />In the opening scene, the reader is introduced to Declan Hale's life when the young bookstore owner is challenged to an old western style gunfight, but with books. Hale lives in True Earth and for those with Will stories and words have power and books written with Will can tap into the primal forces of the universe and create entire new worlds.<br /><br />Most of the unfolding story revolves around the War of the Tomes which Declan single-handedly ended five years ago. Apparently no-one is happy with what he did to end it, especially not Declan. Now Declan has been banished to True Earth and spends his time drinking and writing an endless book. He is bitter, tired, and cynical and most of the action in the book consists of reactions by Declan to repercussions from that war.<br /><br />As this fast paced story unfolds, Declan's history is told in bits and pieces. The history that is revealed is intricate and interesting with an epic feel and by the end, the reader can fully sympathize with Declan's dark side.<br /><br />Upon reflection, the history was more interesting than the actual story which is perhaps why Mr. Ducie told it the way he did.<br /><br />Cons<br />The author is too frugal with information. This makes the story hard to read and leaves a lot of questions about what exactly happened.<br />Some of the terminology felt misplaced and used more because it sounds cool than because it makes sense. The worlds created by the books is referred to as 'The Forgotten' which is anything but forgotten. He refers to the worlds created by Willful writers as the 'Infernal Worlds' and the powers used to create them 'Infernal'. That one still has me scratching my head. Even the title Distant Star which sounds cool would seem more at ease on a space opera than this multi-worlds urban fantasy.<br />Some of the interactions and dialog between characters seem designed to be evocative and fraught with innuendo and hidden meaning without ever revealing what the characters intended.<br />Using books as weapons to evoke gunslinger images was a stretch and felt more goofy than interesting. It felt like maybe that was the genesis of the book: 'Hey, wouldn't it be cool if these guys dueled with books?' But, when the story evolved beyond that goofy concept, the author couldn't bring himself to let it go.<br />Pros<br />Interesting story with good pacing.<br />Sympathetic characters<br />Strong engaging writing style.<br />Deep and complex world. There was a great feeling of depth to it.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />If you were to just read the pros and cons you might think I didn't enjoy the book, but that is not the case.  I enjoyed the story and have found myself reflecting on it a lot. In my book, that means it was worth reading.<br /><br />After perusing some of the other reviews, the things which I felt were shortcomings obviously didn't have the impact on other reviewers that they did on me.

US,16951812,R2R6QXJILT9H2E,B008MAZ0PU,124109245,Guild Wars 2 Digital Deluxe [Online Game Code],Digital_Video_Games,5,9,14,False,False,Worth the wait!,"This review is based partially on the third beta event weekend and the first day of the 3-Day head start for pre-purchasing the game.  I have played parts of the personal quest lines, the dynamic events, player versus player (pvp), world versus world (wvw), and have had some experience with crafting items.  I cannot speak to end game content.  Also, I have never played the first Guild Wars so I cannot compare the two games, but I am an experienced MMO player.<br /><br />Based on my initial impressions I can say that this was definitely an MMO definitely worth me picking up.  The fact that there is no monthly subscription fee was a solid factor in my decision to pick this game up.  There is an in-game gem store where you can spend real world money to buy some extras, but these extras are not needed for the game.  I believe most items that can be purchased are primarily cosmetic in nature so a person cannot buy their way to giving themselves an advantage in the game.  There may be items to temporarily increase your experience rate, I can't say for sure, but if there are it has no impact on other players given that both pvp and wvw normalize all players to level 80.<br /><br />You can tell that every aspect of the game was carefully considered from the ground up.  That is not to say that ideas from other MMOs were not taken and incorporated into the game, but you can tell that the game was carefully crafted in an attempt to correct the past mistakes of other MMO's and to take some of the ideas in previous games and make improvements.  There are a lot of aspects to a game of this scope, so I will try to touch on as much of it as possible, but it may lack detail in some areas.  If you have a question, leave a comment and I will try to answer it in more detail.<br /><br />CHARACTER CREATION<br />The customization of your character is extensive.  There are 5 playable races and 8 different professions (their term for classes) - Mesmer, Guardian, Ranger, Elementalist, Thief,Warrior, Engineer, and Necromancer.  All of the character models are visually stunning.  You can tweak things like body type and different facial dimensions to make your character look even more unique.  GW2 employs a dye system that allows you to place up to three different color combinations separately on your chest, legs, gloves, and boots.  What is nice about the system is that as your pick up new armor and equip it, it will inherent these colors so no more mismatched gear.  Yeah!  And you can change your color combinations at any time.  You pick your character's personal storyline.  Did you come from a wealthy family or are you a commoner?  Which of the 6 Gods do you align yourself with?  What experience/goal in your life are you striving to overcome or what regret do you want to right?<br /><br />GRAPHICS<br />The in game animations are amazing.  Every spell that is cast is unique and satisfying.  If you cast a phoenix to attack an enemy it will create a yellow glowing bird that will flap it's wings to the target and burst into flames.  The environments are epic and awe inspiring.  The settings are varied and the lanscapes feel organic.  All of this adds to the feeling of being in a world that is less engineered and more like one that would truly exist with things living in it.  One thing I can say is that the game has done a tremendous job with scale.  The map and the vistas feel enormous.  Cities feel like cities.  This may also be due to the fact that there are no mounts, so you will be running everywhere you go, but there are waypoints where you can pay a nominal fee to fast travel.  I thought I would miss mounts, however, with my progress in the game up to this point I haven't yet thought, \""I wish I had a mount.\""<br /><br />GAMEPLAY<br />GW2 is a very open world in terms of quests and dynamic events.  Things just sort of happen around you and you go with the flow.  I find the concept refreshing but if you are the type of player that likes structure and direction, you may not enjoy this setup.  The game starts with tutorials to help you get started, but as the game progresses the amount of direction on where to go and what to do drops off.  With GW2 you no longer cash in quests.  You will get item rewards occasionally, usually in your personal storyline where there is more interaction with npcs, but any financial gain you get is mailed to you.  There are few quests that require you talk to a person. If you are traveling around and see something you want to participate in, you can, or you can keep moving on by and look for something else that tickles your fancy.  If you help in an event, all players get a reward if they contributed. You don't have to worry about people stealing your kill because everyone gets loot from attacking a mob.  No rolling for gear and no more ninja looters.  Same with gathering crafting materials.  Three or more players can mine the same node, so you don't have to rush to be the first one there.<br /><br />Each server is constructed such that gameplay on that server during questing is cooperative.  There is no picking of dark and light sides or ability to flag yourself to fight one another.  Competitive fighting is left to the pvp arenas within a server and wvw is massive pvp that pits 3 servers against one another at the same time.  More on this modes later.  There is also aquatic combat that allows you to use harpoons and spear guns, which again have there own unique attacks.<br /><br />Something I found interesting, which may be part of the original GW, is that your abilities are linked to the weapons you are using in both your main and offhands.  You start with one base attack for a weapon.  For example, if you have an axe as a hunter use of that specific axe attack will unlock another unique axe attack, and so forth.  The weapon you are holding in your offhand will also affect the next two abilities you unlock.  If you pick up a two-handed great sword, you start again working with the first unique attack for a two-handed sword and unlock additional abilities unique to that weapon.  Unlocking weapon abilities goes quickly.  After level 10 you start unlocking points to assign to certain attributes to tailor your character to the type of play you want.  You can increase your dps or survivability, etc.  While each character can play any role and has healing abilities.  Some professions are better than others at specific roles still.  You also accumulate skill points that allow you to unlock other spells/attacks that are not weapon specific.  Another feature is that any player can revive any downed player at anytime.<br /><br />In order to keep world populations full, Arenanetessentially \""instances\"" the server you are playing on so you can continue to play the game along with everyone else in the overflow, instead of waiting for a queue in a loading screen.  I like this idea but I'm not sure whether is causes problems when grouping or not.  I have seen some comments in the game chat that grouping isn't as friendly as other games, so you may want to take this under consideration when considering your purchase.  Something I'm not fan of is the fact that you pick a single server that all your characters on.  You can visit other servers and quest with friends, but you can only play wvw on your own world.  Also, it appears that you may only get 5 character slots???  Maybe someone reading this can confirm whether there is another way to unlock more slots.<br /><br />Arenanet has also added some little features that help make questing easier.  You can carry around what is known as a salvage kit and reduce items that you don't want/can't use into base components for crafting.  And any crafting materials can be sent to your collection, so it really frees up bag space.<br /><br />SOUND<br />The music in GW2 is pleasant and non-intrusive.  Background music consists of the type of scores that you can listen to for hours and not become repetitive.  Spell and weapons effects are solid and the voice acting is fairly good in some parts to really good in others.  The ambient conversations that occur in the world add life to it and can be quite humorous at times.  Kids playing say things like you would expect kids to say one another.<br /><br />PVP<br />I played a limited amount of pvp during the last beta event weekend but I haven't touched it in the game at launch.  Players are normalized to level 80 and every ability you can unlock is unlocked.  The intent is that it is pure skill versus skill, as opposed to abilities giving another player an advantage.  The games are set up to just continuously cycle through all the maps so if you get into a game there is barely any delay until the next map.  The idea is that if you get into a group you like you can just keep playing, which I like.  I wonder, however, if you can get into a situation of too many people leaving at the beginning of a match and putting one team at a disadvantage and trying to play catch up when they finally get their full complement of players.  If I recall correctly I believe all matches are 8 on 8.  The matches seemed fun and the design of the boards made for some interesting battles.<br /><br />WVW<br />Taking the concept of scale that I discussed earlier, the scale of WVW is epic.  Three servers compete for keeps, resources, and a large castle in the center of the map.  The battles are enormous.  Like PVP each player is normalized to level 80 but for WVW you are limited to the skills you have already unlocked during PVE.  There is some lag during WVW gameplay but it appears to be significantly reduced from the beta.  I have adjusted from running full settings to the bare minimum, but it doesn't have any impact on framerate.  The never ending 3-way tug of war that wages in WVW has real implications to each of the home worlds.  The server winning the WVW gets buffs for the server.  I haven't gotten a chance to look at the types of perks/buffs given, so I will try to update this review when I get a chance to look at that.<br /><br />All in all I would give the game 5 STARS for fun and 4.5 STARS overall.  I'm thoroughly enjoying the game and aside for some minor things that impact me I think the game is great.  Again, some of the issues may be more significant to others, but I am looking forward to playing the game for sometime.",2012-08-26,1871,extra_long,2012-08,games

Found a lot of really good information here that was very helpful and realized that many things have changed in recent years, especially regarding food.  The book is well organized so that finding the chapter pertaining to what you are looking for doesn't mean having to wade through an entire book.  The chapters I found most helpful were on quality foods, bringing a new cat into the already established residence, and toys.  My older cat has benefitted from the knowledge I gleaned as well because I was able to get her a better quality food now knowing what to buy and why. Also love reading on Jenny's website,Floppy Cats, because she reviews many products and lets her own kitties try them so others will know firsthand what to expect without having to purchase something that may or may not work for your specific cat and why. Because of her reviews, I bought several toys and found them to be high quality that both the older cat and new kitten enjoy which is bringing them together very peacefully.  I think this book will be really helpful to anyone who is getting a new kitten whether is it a Ragdoll or not because of the wide variety of subjects covered from toys to food, and even scratching posts and litter boxes.

When I went back on to the Amazon site to download the photo of the book I noticed that there were two reviews and so I pulled them up and had a look at them and both reviewers on Amazon UK,  felt very short changed and for that reason gave it a 1 star rating.  I then popped over to Amazon US  and there are 18 reviews there, but once again almost without exception everyone is on about being ripped off by both Amazon and the author, do they have a point?<br /><br />Well that's the big question today isn't it, how much is an authors work worth and how much are you willing to pay for it.<br /><br />As to the question in regard to this particular piece, from my own view, the answer is Yes and NO!<br /><br />Sitting right on the 'Picket Fence' on this one.<br /><br />On the one hand I believe that an authors work, like anything else has got a value and we as readers should pay for it, unless either the author or the seller is doing a deal on it and either giving it away free or at a reduced price as a promotion.<br /><br />I also understand NOW, since reading the American reviews that this was first released in 2005 as a short story, so those people commenting that it was only a chapter and seemed unfinished need to learn the difference between a Novella/ Novelette and a book. And, as it only took them around 15 minutes to read, re -read it, slowly, and I am sure that they will find that the Novella had a beginning, a middle and an end, for goodness sake what more do you want in a written piece (apart from more words and pages).<br /><br />But, to an extent I am with the gripe about not knowing how much you were getting in relation to the cost of the purchase.  C.J. Box's books don't get that much of a discount as he is a publishing house author and I have no idea how much control mainstream authors have over pricing as opposed to all of my wonderful Indie authors, so there is that argument.  But, I think it only right and proper that there should be a disclaimer at the point of purchase, and a prominent one at that, warning and advising the purchaser, that the book about to be purchased is in fact a short story and then they could make their decision to purchase, or not, based on that notice.<br /><br />In the end, you cannot expect everything to be free but why some have said in their reviews that 'lost a fan' is completely off base and I have no understanding why they would say that.<br /><br />The Novella was a structured read, it did, as I have already stated have a beginning a middle and an end and it was entertaining for the 25 minutes it took me to read it, so on that basis<br /><br />Update<br /><br />I have just checked the Amazon sites both here and the US.  Both sites do in fact print a disclaimer but not sure if they have been there for long, I certainly never noticed them before the UK one is  here and the US one is  here  and where both estimate the 'book' to be 21 pages.

US,13270755,R1X8LTWJVUTWBU,B005JF4MTQ,78312046,Risen,Digital_Video_Games,4,3,4,False,True,A game that far makes up for what it lacks.,"Now, I think it needs to be said that a big thing that might influence my review is that I'm a pretty atypical gamer: a loyal PC gamer with the passion of a hardcore gamer without the budget or motivation to buy ever single flashy new game that comes out. That, and I'm actually kind of terrible at video games. If the game has an easy mode, I'll use it and never move on. This admission may seem pointless, but I do have a point - a big one! - as to why this game is a winner: I'm picky about my games. Very,very picky. A game that grabs my attention has to be challenging, but not too hard. It has to have and interesting storyline without only being an interactive movie. It has to give the player freedom to just play around without losing its linear plot line.<br /><br />Now, I'd been eying this game with some skepticism for some time now because I can tell just by looking at it that it's lacking in some big ways for a modern gamer. As it was made three years ago, clearly it was not going to have anything terribly flashy in terms of graphics (a plus for me, seeing that I'm running it on a measly Dell Inspiron and it runs like a charm) and it had a clear-cut main character on the front (which raises a red flag in terms of getting any kind of character customization). I was given no idea what the plot was about from the description (which is usually the first thing I look for) and by all means, I probably would have never bought this game had it not gone on sale.<br /><br />Now, less than three hours into the game, I've found that I was right to be skeptical... and wrong. Yes, going from Skyrim to this, the graphics actually made me laugh out loud at first. In fact the first twenty minutes of the game had me thinking that it was unintentionally goofy, but in a charming way. The controls were a little odd, but I got used to them pretty easily. Then, things quickly changed. After I broke free of the tutorial stage, (which, again, was a little goofy, but necessary or I wouldhave fallen flat on my face and fast) the game picked up and started to become as gritty as the description describes.<br /><br />But let's talk about the combat for a moment. As a terrible gamer, both Skyrim and Fable alike can vouch for the fact that I am allergic to the tactic of 'blocking'. I run into battle, hit things as hard as physically possible, and lick my wounds later, doing nothing to prevent them, in a classic barbarian style, I suppose. Risen, however, quickly broke me of that habit by having a great combat system with realistically difficult enemies that might go down easily enough, but hit like a truck. Even a lowly boar can put an end to you if you aren't paying attention, and I love that. It makes you pay attention. It got me to the point where I started to actually learn the tactics of the monsters I was fighting, because each had a different style. It injected a great amount of realism into the game. What really drove home the attention to detail in combat were, of all things, the wolves. When I first encountered a wolf in the game, it's just a singular wolf that liked to run circles around me, which I found to be quite annoying while I was trying to land a hit. Later on, I ran into a pack of the damned things and I started to find their tactic a little less annoying and much more... deadly. Not only was it hard to focus on killing one at a time when they're all dancing around each other, but they ended up flanking me and getting behind my blocks, attacking me from the side. As I stared down at my character's lifeless body, I fell a little bit in love. A game that has so much attention to detail that a pack of wolves behaves much like one in real life would was the thing that really captured my heart about this game.<br /><br />It wasn't the first thing that caught my attention, though. The very first thing was the voice acting. Yeah, sure, it comes standard on pretty much every video game these days, but after growing up with PC games with terrible voice actors or playing games like Skyrim that had maybe 20 voice actors that they used over and over, this game took me buy surprise. Every character I talked to had a different voice, or, if they had the same voice actor, the personality or accent of the character was so different that I could hardly tell. And there's another point: personality. Sure, there are a few generic NPCs that you can't talk to, (labeled clearly so they're impossibly to mistake for other characters) but if you have to talk to them for a quest or training or even to buy something, you can bet they have a personality and the dialogue will be sure to flaunt it. Even when you train, they have snippets of dialogue that has the trainer actually talking to you and giving tips instead of the generic \""LEVEL UP\"" you tend to get in most games. I also found myself frequently laughing out loud at jokes or sarcastic remarks that an NPC makes. That being said, the M rating on this game is well-earned in the dialogue alone. I ended up in an outlaws camp, and you can put a good bet on how much they love to swear like sailors and make crude remarks. Normally, that would turn me off a game, but the realistic setting of such language made it natural instead of forced crudeness for laughs.<br /><br />The main character, though. Ah, I could write sonnets about the main character's sarcastic humor that frequently has me in tears without use of unnecessary swearing for a crutch. He has his own voice actor that I must say, is a brilliant human being for being able to portray a sarcastic, realist personality without it turning out vapid (I'm looking at you, male!Shep). To be honest, I thought I was going to resent the main character as I normally do when I'm not allowed to change the gender and even more so when I'm not allowed to change any features whatsoever, but the character is so well thought out and lovable that I didn't mind at first. I minded even less when I started to see how customizable characterclass is. It's akin to Skyrim in which you start out with no class can do pretty much anything (as long as you train in it) and your fighting style slowly evolves into what fits you best as a player.<br /><br />On a more meta note, I've seen a few glitches (Characters and mobs clipping through walls, ridiculous camera angles that bring you right up in someones face during dialogue, etc) but none of them have been game-breaking. Even when I've managed to get myself stuck somewhere, I manage to jiggle out somehow. The glitches I've found are mostly just aesthetic and really doesn't have a negative effect on the game at all. So far, it seems like the developers have made the game about as fool-proof as physically possible, but as a particularly talented fool, I'm sure I'll find something before I finish the game.<br /><br />Before I risk rambling for too long, I'm going to give a bottom line: As a lot of the reviews have said, it takes a little getting used to before you start to find your niche, but once you find it, the game is very enjoyable and makes up for its little shortcomings. I would most definitely recommend buying it.",2012-11-29,1328,extra_long,2012-11,games

You can also play with a stripped-down, browser-based version of OneNote if you have an MSN or Hotmail account and you add the free Windows Live SkyDrive feature to it...just start using the Office 365 features and you should be able to access the browser-based version.  Last, Microsoft will let you download a free trial copy of OneNote at the Microsoft Office website.<br /><br />The #1 problem with OneNote is simply that no one I run across seems to know what it is.  However, if you take just 5-10 minutes to poke around you'll find that Microsoft OneNote is the most useful part of the suite that you never knew existed.<br /><br />Put simply, OneNote is a place for your stuff.  Think of it as a switchboard for MS Office.  OneNote lets you organize groups of topics into \""Notebooks\"".  Each Notebook you create has a series of tabs across the top (called \""Sections\""), and each Section contains one or more pages.  The structure is similar to a filing cabinet, with tabs, folders, and files, but because this is a piece of software we're talking about, it does oh so much more.<br /><br />The goal behind OneNote is that you should open the program and immediately be able to start working.  The is no Save button, anywhere:  everything you do is saved in realtime--that way, you don't have to think about anything but what you're trying to do.  It isn't designed for detailed text formatting like Word, but it is smart enough to auto-create some of the things you commonly use, like bulleted lists and tables of information.  For example, if I want to start typing rows and columns in a grid, I simply...start typing.  Hit tab and a grid is created, with the cursor scooted on to the next cell every time I hit tab (and new rows created when I hit Enter).  I can pick bulleted lists from the toolbar, or I can just type a dash and a space and OneNote gets the idea that I'm enumerating--and of course it does the same for numbered or lettered lists (a., b., c., etc.).  This makes it easy to just sit down in a meeting, start taking notes, and dress it up later if you want to.  I have a handy \""Meeting Minutes\"" template in MS Word.  I type my notes in OneNote, and when I'm done I open the template, copy/paste the notes into it, save & send the document, and I'm done.<br /><br />This becomes a huge benefit when you realize that OneNote is searchable:  if I need to find which meeting it was when my team talked about X, I just search OneNote and get a listing of all references.  I can dial down the results to one Section of tabs, or grow it out to every OneNote Notebook I have.  What blew my mind was when I dropped a screenshot into a page and found that OneNote used OCR to pick keywords out of my picture!  Searches are fast, and the best part is that OneNote will let me get away with being sloppy.  If you want to take a \""junk drawer\"" approach, you can start dumping files of all kinds into OneNote.  When you paste a file, you are given the options to drop it in like an e-mail attachment (has an icon, you double-click, and it opens), as the content (dumps the contents of the doc into the page), or as a link to the place it came from.  If you copy/paste information from another place, including the web, OneNote will automatically drop a citation link in for you, be it to a place on a network, on your hard drive, or on the web.<br /><br />But that's just the beginning.  You can share your notebook across computers, across a network, or via the web.  If you have a Windows Live SkyDrive account, you can get Cloud-y and use SkyDrive as a nexus so that no matter where you are, you can get to your Notebooks and sync them across machines.  Shared notebooks can be restricted at the notebook level, by section, or even by page.  You can encrypt and password-protect.  You can log into your MSN account and access SkyDrive to work with your Notebooks if you're on a computer that doesn't have OneNote installed.  You can move notebooks around, merge them, and more.  You can record meetings with your computer's microphone and it'll be saved directly into your Notebook or out to a separate file.  You can also use a screen grabber to take screenshots of just about anything.<br /><br />OneNote also bridges the gap across programs:  you can \""Print\"" to OneNote, e-mail to OneNote, or right-click a file and \""Send to OneNote\"".  If you're feeling lazy, you can just point it at OneNote and go, without telling it what to do with the content...OneNote will put it in a section called \""Unfiled Notes\"" and let you sort it out later.  If you have a tablet-based computer, drawing tablet, or even one of those old \""pen-based computers\"", you can draw directly on the screen.  There are drawing tools, too.  Or if you just like drawing and don't have any of those, you can mark up your notes using the mouse, just like freehand drawing in Photoshop.<br /><br />So here are two very good examples, work and home, of how OneNote can be the Right Arm of Microsoft Office:<br /><br />Work:<br />I manage IT Projects.  I have a notebook for each project, with sections labeled \""Overview\"", \""Initiation\"", \""Planning\"", \""Development\"", \""Testing\"", \""QA\"", \""Production\"", and \""Meetings\"".  Each phase of my project has important information in the appropriate section--for example, \""Overview\"" gives the history of the project, who asked for it, why we're doing it, and who to contact.  When I'm in a meeting, I open the Notebook, start typing in a new page in the \""Meetings\"" tab, and when I'm done I copy/paste into my Template, \""Save As\"", and e-mail it.  It makes quite an impression when the people in my meeting have the minutes waiting for them before they get back to their desk.<br /><br />Home:<br />I had a real problem with Post-It notes:  I loved them too much.  I'd write stuff down on these sticky colored scraps and they'd end up everywhere.  Sifting through them to find the one I was looking for was annoying.<br /><br />I made a OneNote Notebook with sections for each logical group.  Now I have a \""Contacts\"" Section for people/companies' contact information that really doesn't need to be in my Outlook Contacts--or information that doesn't fit on my phone, like mailing addresses.  I have a \""Computers\"" section that has separate pages for each computer, with specs and information I need to know at a glance.  Most importantly, \""Electronics\"" - all the stuff I have that I sometimes have to go back and fool with.  My Onkyo receiver, Samsung Flat-Panel TV, PlayStation 3, and more have their own pages with notes on my settings and copies of the user guides.  If I buy something online, I no longer print my receipt, I just choose \""Send to OneNote\"" and point it at my \""Purchase Receipts\"" section, where it gets its own page.

The personal notebooks I password protect and sync through my SkyDrive account.

The book went into so much detail about the character's lives and their plight in District 12, and this movie did VERY little of that. I felt the movie took a few ideas from the book and then pieced together various action sequences. One of the things I loved about the book was Katniss' ability to survive everything thrown at her and to be resourceful, and the intuition between her and Haymitch. The book spent time talking about Katniss' struggle to find water and she wondered why Haymitch wasn't sending her water. Then it occurred to her that Haymitch was trying to tell her she must be close. The movie made Katniss' time in the arena look like a cake-walk. The story of her father teaching her to hunt and sing was barely eluded to in the movie. The relationship between Katniss and Peeta was not developed and left me wondering \""why are we routing for these 2\"". In the book you fell in love with Peeta and Katniss on when she washed him, cleaned his wound, they took turns keeping watch in the cave, they were sent a feast by the sponsors--these moments were briefly skimmed over by the movie.

As your tribe emerges into increasingly hostile landscapes you must use your magic powers to sculpt the natural world in order to protect your people and aid them in their quest for the \""Ancients-\"" a past tribe that mastered similar powers. To do this you can move soil and water, pour out lava to make stone, evaporate water with brilliant sunlight, and perform a variety of other miracles which you unlock by helping your villagers settle towns on each map.<br /><br />As a technical demo, From Dust is amazing. Flowing water conforms to rivers you create in the terrain, dirt settles and erodes (and plant growth resists this), lava flows on rock and cools in water, and burns sand into hard stone, and wildfires rip through forests frighteningly. The simulated natural world you interact with feels very real, and everything you feel like you can do totally works- damn a river to make a lake, douse a sandy coast in lava to turn it into a hard stone bank, or blast a trench in a mountainside to divert lava- it all behaves convincingly and organically.<br /><br />As a game From Dust is fun, but has its shortcomings. The challenge is uneven- some later maps are easier than early maps. It is also very short, and astute players may finish in a single setting. Your villagers are also as dumb as bricks and will take the worst routes possible when exploring the map for relics and spells- at one point my shaman ignored a sturdy stone bridge directly from his village to a relic in favor of hiking over an active volcano. And while the game looks fantastic, it also uses the same basic materials in every level, so after a while all the horrible disaster areas you march your peons through start looking samey.<br /><br />For what it's worth I have not experienced the server outages many users have- but I will warn that this game demands both Steam AND Ubisoft's DRM client, which I think is excessive.

That's not to say this book about fate was predictable, but rather it foreshadowed a tone that was continuously delivered.<br /><br />Having been a frequent visitor to Mr. Wendig's blog Terribleminds, I was initially surprised by his choice of cliche plot device, a girl Miriam who sees how people will die just by touching their skin.  This disenchantment quickly faded as I dove into the witty dialogue and coy story structure which flirted with the promise of being a little more than your average urban fantasy.  Miriam's sharp tongue and rye attitude towards life was an intriguing character trait that kept me reading to find out more about this bad apple than caring so much about the nagging notion that it might all end as fate intended.  Though a shift in perspective was a little jarring, mostly because I felt settled into Miriam's point of view several chapters in, it was more telling of this young spitfire scavenging along the highway of a life she doesn't even know herself.  What could cause a woman to become so dark and terse towards death that even a psychic power couldn't explain?<br /><br />I'm not gonna tell you because even knowing ahead of time won't stop you from wondering.

The film overcomes racism by using captivating camera angles and music to evoke more of an emotional response from the audience. Remember The Titans is about America's goal in attaining racial harmony and the price people have to pay in order to do so.<br /><br />The struggle of being black in such a radical time is reflected on one of the first scenes in the movie. T.C. Williams High School was one of the schools that were forced to integrate and because of the integration of the three American public high schools, black coach Herman Boone was to replace white coach Bill Yoast at T.C. Williams. Due to the strong racial tensions in Virginia, coach Boone recognizes the unspoken racial rules that he will be breaking, but also acknowledges the respect that he will be bringing to the black community in Virginia. Yoast is extremely hesitant under Boone and this clearly establishes the relationship between the two races. From his hesitancy, we see the whites still see themselves as superior. Despite all the criticism coach Boone receives from whites, he responds professionally - and vows to blind himself from skin color and treat all football players the same.<br /><br />Right before the school year starts, pre-season football camp begins. Black and white players are extremely suspicious and distrustful of each other and even when they get on the two buses, separate by race. Coach Boone sees this and orders the team to sit by what position they play on the field, either defense or offense. By doing this, Boone quickly establishes himself as a disciplinarian. He refuses to be viewed as inferior - yet, he is fair when he deals with both blackand white players. He forces the team to get to know each other - demanding that until they do, they will have to practice rigorously three times a day. When the players realize there is no way out, Alan, one of the white players and Petey, a black player, \""get to know each other\"". In this scene, Petey and Alan are sitting on opposite sides - facing each other as if they were enemies. Right in between them is a path running between up the Building of Gettysburg College - this metaphorically resembles the slave-ownership times and how it still reflec ts on the tensions between black and white today. The scene continues on with Alan asking Petey, \""What's your daddy's name? Wait. You do have a daddy, right? ... What's he do? Wait. He does have a job, right?\"" Alan's questions reflect on the misconceptions whites have on blacks - that most black men are unemployed and aren't around for the family. This scene is especially important because it allows the audience to realize the huge racial gap.<br /><br />Camp goes on, and even during practice, heavy racial tensions unravel. White players refuse to help defend the black players, which in turn pushes the black players to do the same. This leads to a confrontation between black player Julius Campbell and white captain Gerry Bertier. Bertier complains that Julius only plays for himself, and Julius responds, \""Nobody plays. Yourself included. I'm supposed to wear myself out for the team? What team? Nah, nah what I'm gonna do is look out for myself and I'ma get mine. ... Attitude reflects leadership, captain\"". The scene eminently displays the distrust both races have for each other. It also evokes emotion in the audience - it is clear both players want to play their best, but the only thing stopping them is their skin color.<br />In reality, this confrontation never happened. Gerry Bertier and Julius Campbell had always been good friends - and maintained that friendship up until Bertier's death in 1990. The film dramatizes racial barrier by showing the two boys as enemies before they became best friends.<br /><br />One night during camp, Coach Boone wakes the whole team up at three in the morning to go for a run. This is one of the most important scenes in the movie, as it significantly alters the relationships between the black and white players. When they arrive at Gettysburg cemetery, coach Boone gives one of the most powerful speeches in the movie,<br />\""This is where they fought the battle of Gettysburg. Fifty thousand men died right here on this field, fighting the same fight that we are still fighting among ourselves today. This green field right here, painted red, bubblin' with the blood of young boys. Smoke and hot lead pouring right through their bodies. Listen to their souls, men. I killed my brother with malice in my heart. Hatred destroyed my family. You listen, and you take a lesson from the dead. If we don't come together right now on this hallowed ground, we too will be destroyed, just like they were. I don't care if you like each other of not, but you will respect each other. And maybe... I don't know, maybe we'll learn to play this game like men\"".<br />The camera is shot through a high angle in this scene - painting Coach Boone as more superior, which adds more strength to his speech. The Titans Theme music also draws weight to the decisions the players have to make; they either start working together as a team or they fall apart. The next day, the team begins cooperating - defending one another and even in the locker rooms, a clear bond begins to forge.<br />In reality though, the team never ran up to Gettysburg cemetery at three in the morning. Coach Boone did not give an inspirational speech quite like that one - this scene was inserted to represent the beginning of the overcoming of racial tensions between the team.<br /><br />In the movie, there were still some players who are unhappy about the segregation. Ray, one of the white football players, refuse to work together as a team and constantly allowed his black players to get hurt. Team captain Gerry Bertier sees this and convinces Coach Boone to kick him off the team. Despite Boone's rule to never kick anyone off, he makes an exception - Bertier's concern represents a huge step towards racial harmony; he is no longer limited by skin color and sees beyond that with his teammates. In reality, no one was ever kicked off the team. Ray was a fictionalized character - the scene was added to the movie to display the united front the team faced together.<br /><br />The film also emphasizes a lot of attitudes and beliefs white people had. This is indicated when the team returns from football camp. Unlike the past couple of weeks, the racial hatred in Alexandria is much more intense - demonstrated through the protests of desegregation outside of T.C. Williams High. The whites are still very bitter towards the segregation. In one instance, Bertier introduces his white girlfriend Emma to Julius- and when Campbell offers his hand, she refuses to shake it. This did not actually happen in real life, as Emma was also a completely fictionalized character. The titans website addressed this and said, \""Emma is, at best, a composite of bad traits of a lot of people\"". This scene was only added to emphasize the superiority the whites felt. (put sentence in beginning and add, so reader knows why you're giving example)<br /><br />There are also many made up scenes to make the movie more interesting. This allows the audience to become more empathetic towards the players. For instance, right before the first game, Coach Boone is told that if he loses even one game, he would be fired. Under intense pressure, Boone works his players fiercely - and even before the first game, vomits due to stress. But because of his drive, the Titans win every game - and while doing so, gaining more support from the community. Right before the state championships though, members of the school board rigged the game in wanting for Boone to get fired. Coach Yoast realizes what they have done and threatens the referee. The referees yield - which results in Coach Yoast losing the potential position in the Hall of Fame. This scene is vital to the movie - the Hall of Fame is one of the most prestigious awards you can receive in the community. Yet, Coach Yoast is willing to sacrifice this award for the better good. It is clear here that Coach Yoast has stepped over a barrier many in the town are refusing to do. In reality, this did not actually happen. This scene was put in to represent the unity of Coach Yoast and Coach Boone. It is also here that we see the diversity of roles the actors can play. At the beginning of the movie, Coach Boone is portrayed as a disciplinarian, very self-controlled and composure. In this scene, Coach Boone loses a bit of his coolness, succumbing to his anger when he thinks the referee is intentionally making bad calls. Tough movie reviewer James Beradinelli agrees. Even though he doesn't particular like the movie, he says about Denzel Washington (Coach Boone), \""And, even though nearly every individual is pretty much a cut-and-dried type, those whom we get to know on a first-name basis are likable. Of course, the presence of an accomplished actor like Washington doesn't hurt, nor does the fact that some attention is paid to giving his character depth and complexity\"". Not only did the actors do a good job, but the music also represented the tone of the movie well.<br />The popular tune, \""Ain't No Mountain High Enough\"" in the film represented the break of the barrier. On the bus ride to the camp, one of the black players begin singing before another player tells him to shut up. Later on when the two racial groups come together as a team in the locker rooms, the song is blasted on full volume, with both races singing along. This represents the cooperative team spirit they finally attain.<br />Another important song in the movie is the 1960's song, \""Na, na, na, na/na, na, na, na/ Hey Hey Hey/ Goodbye\"". The song is played throughout the film in different tones in representing the mood of the scene. When the team returns from football camp, they're all singing the song in the original tune. In that certain scene, they're saying goodbye to the racial tensions that they were able to break and were finally able to come together as a team and celebrate. The second time we hear this song is when the Titans win their first game, and similar to the first time they sing it, it's a celebration of the team's coming together. The last time we hear the song is at the end of the film when the team comes together for the final time to mourn for Gerry Bertier's death. Julius, who eventually becomes Bertier's best friend, begins humming in a grieving tone. It is sung with pain, yet through pain comes unification.<br /><br />Remember The Titans was not all that perfect though. There was controversy that the film was not actually all about race - since the three schools integrated, there was a much larger gene pool of talent, which could have been the reason why the players didn't get along during training camp.  An English teacher at T.C. Williams said kids \""adjusted pretty well to (the integrated) situation. The kids behaved a whole lot better than most of the adults\"".  Screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard disagrees. He says, \""Yeah right. Who wants to say `I hated (black people)?' Who wants to say, `I hated white people?' Who wants to say, `We hated each other?'\"" Not only was there controversy, but some movie critics believe the film played \""safe\"". New York Times Review sarcastically adds, \""Before it's all over, there are only good people, although they retain their original color. Given the film's general tone, it's a wonder Washington doesn't convince everyone to turn beige\"". Since the movie was targeted for a younger audience, the critique the movie received was rough. Remember The Titans generally received good reviews, and manages to avoidclichés while attaining to its original message.<br /><br />Although Remember The Titans was extremely dramatized, it had some truth to it. Like Tim O'Brien said,  \""Stories are to console and to inspire and to help us heal. Stories are for those late hours in the night when you can't remember how you got from where you were to where you are\"". It is only through movies like this are we able to move forward - to talk about the big elephant in the room and to understand the true meaning of why we are the way we are. Remember The Titans is not about winning or losing the games. When we cheer for the victories of the Titans, we are not cheering for the points on the scoreboard. We are cheering for a defeat of overcoming racism, every single time.",2012-03-28,2218,extra_long,2012-03,videos

You read that right.<br /><br />farsot. is an incredible band, they don't fall into the trap that Black Metal MUST be poorly produced to be true and authentic to the genre.<br />The songs are ambitious, epic, calming, and brutal. \""Insects\"" might be a wee bit better and easier to grasp, but IIII will stand the test of time because it seems so much more mature, despite being their \""debut\"".<br /><br />One of the things I like is you can understand (despite his singing in German) the vocalist, who is cryptically named: \""10.XIXt\"" (no really, I think it's some kind of math equation). He may be screaming, but his words are clear. I especially love the points at which the vocals turn to a drone, like a chant, in the background of the song.<br /><br />farsot. brings to the table new ideas never tried before in black metal (at least not successfully): experimentation with rhythms, moods, sounds, song structure and tempo. This is not your traditional black metal album, it's sophisticated and artistic... dare I say: modern. The old fashioned black metal epicness, speed, and wall of sound is still there, but this time that wall is made from cinder blocks instead of stones or bricks.<br /><br />The band and this album convey emotion through the medium of black metal, a somewhat narrow range of emotion, but emotion none-the-less; and THAT is why I consider this album art, and the band, artists.<br /><br />If you even kind of like black metal, do yourself a favor and purchase this.

If I could give it 3 1/2 stars I would, but between 3 and 4, 4 would feel dishonest.<br /><br />So, the bad:<br /><br />There could be better proofreading here, but overall not too many cringe moments with grammar or spelling. I've read far worse!<br /><br />A lot of nothing happens. I guess this is a reasonably accurate portrait of smalltown America, especially at that time, but I did have to wonder occasionally what the point was of actually reading about it. That said, I did keep reading despite myself, even though I got this book for free and so wouldn't have lost out by giving up on it. The fact that I kept reading through the humdrum bits has to speak to the talents of the writer.<br /><br />It seemed rather odd to me that not one person seemed to call the sisters out on the rather unhealthy relationship, for example the fact that Griselda could do more or less nothing outside of church, town events and work without risking her sister flipping her lid, or the fact that Griselda continued to feed her sister obscene amounts of food (including lots of cakes and candy) when Agnes was over 600lbs.<br /><br />I realise, again, this is probably partly an \""of its time\"" thing, but I did wonder why the good doctor didn't sit one or both of them down and say, OK, this diet is going to kill her, and do you really wonder she keeps getting sicker and sicker? It seemed like it didn't even occur to Griselda (who seemed a reasonably intelligent woman, and had a enough about her to run the library single-handed), or to any of her friends (for example, Vidalia, who seemed the most grounded person in the town) to think that maybe Agnes having a second lunch every day, and constantly snacking on M&Ms, might not be the best way to look after her. I could understand her not being able to go through with controlling Agnes' eating, but I don't know how realistic it was for her never to even ponder it.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />There were at least a couple of events which I absolutely did not see coming.<br /><br />I liked almost all the characters I was supposed to like; even the demanding Agnes and the enabling Griselda were not unlikeable. Most of the characters felt well realised and well-rounded, which is always a huge plus for me.<br /><br />The biggest selling points: some genuinely funny moments, some genuine pathos and poignancy, and some absolutely beautiful descriptions. I almost felt I'd spent a few months in the Poconos.<br /><br />Similarly, Magnin is a genius at describing food just well enough to make your mouth water: I'll definitely be looking up the recipe for lemon squares!<br /><br />I'd happily read more books about Bright's Pond.<br /><br />I guess the easiest way to put this is that I'd like to read more - but I do hope that future books have a little more plot or character development to them. There was one quite huge plot point here, but I didn't feel there was as much growth in the characters as I'd've liked, and the big plot (which I won't mention as I don't want to post spoilers) seemed almost ludicrous when SO little else actually happened.<br /><br />There are quiet books where nothing happens... and there are books which border on comatose. This one erred a little too much towards the latter. I wouldn't by any means write Magnin off, but I won't be rushing out to buy more of her books at full price unless another of the freebies of hers I have is a little more satisfying.d:<br /><br />There were at least a couple of events which I absolutely did not see coming.<br /><br />I liked almost all the characters I was supposed to like; even the demanding Agnes and the enabling Griselda were not unlikeable.

While aiming for back to roots, it ended up a bland, generic trashy pop album.  It is hardly the pioneering, cutting edge work we saw in Ray of Light.  In an era of DJ infused beats and house driven remixes, this falls short of anything remotely creative.  It begs for a modern-day DJ remix version of just about every song.  She never could carry a note, but her music was always saved by cheap controversial sexcapades or good producers.  She lacks real talent like Lady Gaga who can actually sing and play piano.  Give Me All Your Luvin is about as talent drive as Mickey by Toni Basil. If bubble gum pop is considered cutting edge, these reviewers need their heads examined.  Madonna should either show maturity in her talent or exit gracefully from the scene. I would have thought she would use her years pop experience would have lead her to newer, creative heights rather then a simplistic back to basics.  There are so many cool DJs out there now which she could have teamed up with to cultivate a new DJ house infused pop album.

However, the plot fails ultimately, taking down the entire book with it, and here's why.<br /><br />Problem 1. There is no voice. Not one character emerges as having the book's story to tell, to become the reader's motivation for continued reading -- to bring excitement to and invigorate the tale. All the 5 or 6 primary characters appear rather as equals in the story. Even the heroine and main character, Sophie Marx, shows no heroic features in her persona. I really didn't care if she and the good guys won out in the end or not.<br /><br />Problem 2. The story is a bit too cute. By that I mean the plot is vague and murky from start to finish. Who are these people? What are they doing? Who's in charge? Why would I care? When do I find out some of the answers to the puzzle of money laundering? The basic set-up of the fake investment company in London to fund the operations of the secret black ops CIA-stepchild agency doesn't fly, and worst of all, the attempted explanations of how it all works (financially) are uber-muddy and not logical, let alone credibly detailed.<br /><br />Problem 3. The book is too easy to put down and way too difficult to pick up. It took me 3 weeks to read the thing. I would normally read such an international espionage thriller in 3 days or less. Thus, sorry to say, I found no compelling reason to persist in reading it.<br /><br />Problem 4. The \""love story\"" is not believable - at all. It's just plain silly at its core. Sophie's new love interest (as it works out in the end) may be a brilliant guy, but he's a total boob.<br /><br />Problem 5. The entire denouement lacks credibility.  It all works itself out in about 9 quick pages, unconvincingly and rather unbelievably as well.<br /><br />All that said, the story has some redeeming characteristics. It is current. That is, the locales, people and the story's raison d'etre make sense in this hateful modern world of terrorist activity by everyone. In addition, most of the descriptions of various locations and situations in which the scenes occur are first-rate, believable and, to my knowledge, accurate.

Once installed, however, I realized that the software labels itself \""Not for commercial use\""--meaning, it's not licensed for use in a business, and this was going to be for use in an office.  This was clearly my fault:  I was only looking at the included products, and not thinking about the license terms.<br /><br />No matter; I figured I would simply upgrade him to \""Home and Business\""--only to find that Microsoft's latest upgrade strategy is...well, there isn't one.  According to Microsoft, this keeps things simpler for consumers, because apparently we were having trouble understanding the difference between \""upgrade\"" and \""full\"" versions.  So to upgrade, you just have to buy the higher-level version at full price.  For this reason, I feel Microsoft should do a little more \""are you sure?\"" work during installation (for example, \""Is this software going to be used in a business environment?\"" would have been a great question in my case...)<br /><br />So if you're purchasing this for a business, OR you think you will need Outlook, Access or Publisher eventually, strongly consider buying either the Home and Business version (adds Outlook and business licensing) or Professional version (additionally adds Access and Publisher) instead of this one.<br /><br />As far as the software itself, this suite is everything most people need:  Word (the word-processor), Excel (spreadsheet), PowerPoint (presentation software) and OneNote (a note-taking app optimized for laptop and tablet use), with a number of nice improvements over 2007:  They replaced the big round button with a \""File\"" tab for a more consistent (and less confusing) interface, image editing is much improved (not Photoshop, but WAY better than before), and PowerPoint transitions are much easier to control now as well.

I was not sure what to expect with the original, but I had read glowing reviews of the show, and decided to give it a try (it didn't hurt that season one of this show was available free for download for Prime members, but alas, not the subsequent seasons).<br /><br />This show has an amazing cast, not to mention riveting plot lines. As a costume drama, it is pretty enough but due to the age of the show and the budget constraints back then, the production quality is not as great as contemporary period dramas such as seen on hit series Downton Abbey, the remake Upstairs, Downstairs and others. Some of the episodes in Season One are rendered in black and white instead of color due to a strike back then. This however did not spoil my enjoyment of the show.<br /><br />The series ran for five seasons from 1971 to 1975. The primary setting for the show is 165 Eaton Place, a roomy townhouse, and the time frame spans Edwardian England, the First World War up till 1930. The series explores the lives of the upper-class Bellamy's (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs), and some of the themes covered during this season is the difference between the upper and lower classes, societal changes, and the plight of the poor, among others.<br /><br />The Bellamy's are made up of Richard Bellamy, MP (portrayed by David Langton) and his wife, Lady Marjorie Bellamy (played by Rachel Gurney), the daughter of the Earl and Countess of Southwold, and the couple have two children, James (Simon Williams) who is serving in the military, and strong-willed Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).<br /><br />Meanwhile, the servants downstairs comprise competent and firm butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson); cook Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley); head house parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh, who returns in the remake and takes on the role of housekeeper); a footman, a kitchen maid, and many more.<br /><br />Each episode has an interesting plot hook that keeps the viewer interested and eager to learn what happens next. The second season was even better than the first and that's saying a lot! Bellamy daughter Elizabeth is married, but her marriage remains unconsummated. The sexual tension between husband, the poet Lawrence Kirbridge, and Elizabeth have some serious consequences that places the Bellamy family name in jeopardy. James, the philandering son and alcoholic gets more seriously involved with former housemaid Sarah Moffatt (Pauline Collins) and this too provides more heartbreak for all concerned.<br /><br />Steadfast through it all is head parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh) who helps Elizabeth set up her new household but who eventually finds her way back to the Bellamy's at 165 Eaton Place. A new staff joins the household - a cunning young man named Thomas Watkins (John Alderton, real life husband of Pauline Collins).<br /><br />There is much excitement this season, with clever plot twists that had me riveted to the screen! Even staid, dependable Hudson has a moment of weakness, giving in to vanity and pride, and suffering the consequences.

Not completely unexpected, but annoying nonetheless.<br />b) the Norton pricing for subscription update is significantly higher than buying a new copy of the exact same software from Amazon, thus I bought it through Amazon which leads to a significant issue I had during install:<br /><br />The key provided by Amazon does not activate the version 6 software that I downloaded from Amazon.<br />Fortunately enough the Norton installer informed me of the software that it would activate (Norton 360 version 5) and took me to the download page. In the end there's no harm since version 5 is simply upgraded to version 6 through the program updates, but what a hassle. I don't know if that's Norton's fault or Amazon's fault, but that's pretty lame and I wasted at least an hour chasing it around.<br /><br />The long version is this: I already had Norton v6 installed (Ironically enough I had installed the software update while I was under subscription so that I could more easily make the transition to a new key. hah), so I tried to renew my already installed 360 with my new key from Amazon. It wouldn't let me do that telling me the key is not valid for this software, so I downloaded the just purchased software (ver 6) from Amazon and ran the downloaded installer. A reboot later it still wouldn't let me activate with the key from Amazon. Finally I clued in and clicked through the installer link to the Norton website and it provides me a download link to version 5. Fine, so I download version 5 from Norton, uninstall my unactivate-able version 6, reboot, install version 5, reboot, go to check for update, download the version 6 update from Norton (I didn't feel like trying to install the version 6 that I had downloaded from Amazon and figured I'd just go through the normal update process), install the update... finally done.<br />If the provided key was valid for version 6 this would have taken 5 minutes.",2012-05-04,408,long,2012-05,software

This edition comes with federal, state and e-file (free for federal, +around $20 for states that don't have laws against e-filing fees - in NY e-file is free).<br /><br />I filed by hand in previous years. I finally took the plunge and upgraded to the modern era. One of my relatives is an enrolled agent so I'm mildly familiar with a couple of these other programs, especially Taxcut, which he likes. Taxcut seemed a bit too buggy for my taste and this had a better interface, in my opinion so I went with this. There are a couple of different versions - there are several cheaper than this that doesn't have the investment tools. Make sure you buy one with state and e-filing.<br /><br />I filed a 1040A and didn't itemize (took the standard deduction). I had multiple W-2's, a 1098-T, 1099-DIV, 1099-INT and a broker's statement.<br /><br />Until you get to stocks, the program's excellent. The interface is very easy to use and holds your hand as you go through it. It also uses entered data to find additional deductions and credits. For instance, it notified me of the $250 above the line for teacher's supplies (which I thought had lapsed, honestly). It effortlessly transfers information from the federal return to the state and you can import your W-2 and don't have to even provide it from certain participating employers. You can e-file with the IRS and state (even when you owe or have a refund). In some states, an additional state e-filing fee applies (in NY, however, due to legislation, it's free).<br /><br />Anywho, I have a decent amount of stocks and the occasional ETF. I have to say I'm mixed on this program's treatment of them. I spent the better part of an hour going through the clunky stock portion interface (you have to go to another screen to edit, and only 7 stocks at a time) and making sure the wash sale rule was properly applied for fractional shares of stock that I had sold previously, but had still received dividends in the form of fractional shares because of selling shares after the ex-div date. This would take me about 10 minutes or less by hand. The import also wasn't in the same order as my broker's statement and I had to manually enter a good amount of other information. I imported the information from my brokerage account at TDAmeritrade, who I suspect are partly to blame as well.<br /><br />With ETFs, they also don't ask enough questions and seem to lump them together with mutual funds. Additionally, they don't ask too many questions about precious metals and various other instruments. If you're using this for stocks or other related instruments and investments, you honestly need to already know what you're doing. It's not plug and chug like the rest of the program.<br /><br />The 1098-T and other sections were painless.<br /><br />Overall, quite satisfied. I could probably do most of my investments quicker by hand, but the rest of the program more than makes up for it, especially the e-file and importation. I didn't even have to type in one of my W-2s, and the transfer from Federal to State consisted of one button press. E-filing at 4AM 2 days before the return's due worked great. It also saved the return (as a file and as a Pdf), which I've archived for safekeeping, along with a print copy.<br /><br />Recommended - with one caveat. If you have complex financial instruments (esp. foreign equities and instruments) or frequently trade stocks, make sure you know your tax circumstances thoroughly before using this, or have a CPA or other qualified tax preparer do your return. If you're filing a fairly simple return, this is far and away the best thing out there.",2012-04-15,653,extra_long,2012-04,software

I loved the game on the 360, highly entertaining, smooth controls, great graphics and acceptable view distance. Not so on a PC. My laptop can run Skyrim on highest settings for everything at about 40fps. I got low quality textures and lighting at 30fps with this game. That's fine, I don't care too much about graphics as long as I can play a highly entertaining game for hours and hours. Even with the difficulty in getting things to work, it'd be worth it because GTA IV is so goddamn fun, there's a reason it got a 10/10 from multiple reviewers.<br /><br />Except it wasn't, because the controls were *horrible*. Controls can make or break a game, especially on a PC. The difficulty of a game comes from the player's ability to use the interface to control their character. On a PC, you have 50 keys to work with, and they're not set up to play games, so sharp controls are crucial for PC developers. The button layout makes no sense, the sensitivity is inconsistent when doing different things, delays everywhere etc.<br /><br />But the part that made the game unplayable for me was the clunky car controls. Sharp turns are impossible. With a 360, you can control how sharp you want to turn with an analog stick. Here, they kept it to buttons which are either pressed or not, so the turn sensitivity was just a fixed value that's too low. High speed chases common in the game are impossible because you are forced to drive like a grandma. Why couldn't they do what Halo did and use the mouse to control your car's turns? Car turns are now controlled continuously and not discretely. The whole fun of the game is driving around random places and stealing cars. It's called GRAND THEFT AUTO. Not to mention a couple storyline missions are difficult on the 360 even with sharp car controls, it was literally impossible on the PC(I'm looking at you Little Jacob). Once I realized this, I just quit, uninstalled the game, and got mad at myself for spending money on this without thinking about whether or not it was a good port. It wasn't.",2012-12-29,396,long,2012-12,games

I bought the albums all the way up until the multiple compilations. Lyrics have never been the reason for me to buy a song, but I guess with this song having the line \""Money makes the rules\"" I should know. But stupid me keeps on hoping that the gold of the 70s magic will be repeated is something I keep on getting stuck on.<br />This song is like a reject from HOT IN THE SHADE, even the blurred mix is the same. The song starts on a good riff, straight out of the 80s period, then the mix drops to the cloned sound ( Iced Earth has a vocalist like this song sound), and even the solo guitar work is an attempt at the Ace sound, no individual sound. Totally unreal that the brand has been spoiled to this extent, but  with Gene's voice having the same power, I keep on hoping. At least with the Anniversary editions of Deep Purple Editions, you get more cool material, but if I saw this done on KISS albums, silly me would buy it, but I am sure that Gene and Paul would veto that stuff ( we might actually find out who played on what album, and since he has publically said he does not do that, well no albums like the DP Anniversary releases). As I say to people who know me, I don't apologize for loving KISS in the 70s and the Re-union group with the originals, but what the hell is happening now. All I do is keep on hoping. Maybe Eddie Trunk will have some comment on his site and on THAT METAL SHOW.<br />The Slap down from this review is to be expected. I buy the CDs, as I will the one in October. Keeping Faith with the band is a laughable comment when 2 classic Makeups that belong to other musicians are used by musicians with clone styles. No new makeup ? I give the new music a chance, but if they say its 70s music, and its a re-hash of the 80s albums that dropped ( yet I still bought ); apparently I am still entitled to someone else's opinion. There are plenty more like me who enjoy the classic band, and believed the statements about the last tour(more than 10 years ago). Paul and Gene are great when they fire on the classic tone, but \""money makes the rules\"".<br />  What galls me greatly is that the fans who smack me down act like I am less of a fan just because I react to what KISS has become now. I am definitely emotionally invested in what I experienced as KISS, and I do indeed hope that they come back to what KISS does best, but that seems unlikely, however I do still hope. But when the iconic KISS is continually represented as the original members, but then 2 people are represented as the real deal. Paul and Gene are unique in their 70s creation, but the way they seem to selectively draw on the 70s content ( except when it makes a few Million, see how the Merchandise sells with the original members Photos ) and then they keep up a show that is definitely great, but have 2 members who imitate the 2 members not there. Just who is fooling who?<br />I Love the KISS I knew, seems like the show goes on purely for money, not for any other reason. But, I still hope.",2012-07-19,601,extra_long,2012-07,music

Boy, I didn't know what I was getting into.<br /><br />Installation of the download was actually a cakewalk, just wait for it to download, punch in your key, and the installer does the rest. I must say, Amazon's downloads speeds were impressive, clocking at about 2 Mb/s.<br /><br />However, once the game is installed, it's a totally different story. Apparently, the way the game was coded, the CD key is encrypted in your registry. This causes loads of issues when attempting to join ranked servers. A simple Google search will bring up tons of threads on how to fix the issue, which involved editing a couple of values in my registry.<br /><br />Once this was fixed, the trouble continues. The game crashes every time after about 15-20 minutes of play (I'm running Windows 7 SP1). Along with that, if you wish to play the Project Reality mod, you're out of luck, because the CD Key bug carries over to those servers as well. While there are loads of suggested fixes for the issue (one of which was the one I already used to get the original game to play), I couldn't manage to get anything to work.<br /><br />Other than these issues, the game is fun, and there are still plenty of players to game with and servers to play on. However, if you've played Battlefield 3 at all, you'll realize how much this game is starting to show its age, as the gaming mechanics and graphics are pretty dated. The game suffers from a few balancing issues, namely, the jets are extremely overpowered and can take out a tank in one run. It's a shame that EA doesn't support their games the way they should, as EA is known for having various issues with their games, such as the CD Key issue, that they never address.

Sung by ""JOSEPH TONER, BROADWAY LEGEND""","Intensive research has found that \""Jerome Kern\"" melodies or songs or collections, are a group of copywritten songs that a person must get permission to record. Through the 1940's that person was Sigmund Romberg's orchestra. Most people think of John Charles Thomas as a stiff sounding old time singer. Well, perhaps in his early years he was! And perhaps it is a type of \""character\"" that the man behind the voice played! What I can tell you is the following:<br /><br />FIRST THIS DOES NOT SOUND LIKE THE ORIGINAL ALBUM, the vocals are severely distorted. That is good for the \""Joseph Toner Broadway Historical Society, Inc.\"" founded under \""Joseph Toner, Broadway Legend\"" , as it is going to market the original and more, and maybe with AMAZON if they become more responsible!<br /><br />Al Goodman left Victor Records about 1934 and dedicated himself to recording only for Columbia! IN the FIRST \""Kern\"" COLLECTION IS THE ONLY VOCAL OF RAVENAL EVER RECORDED BEFORE 1933! THAT IS JOSEPH TONER, but see that album set for yourselves. This fits with findings from the NATIONAL THEATRE DATABASE and antique undisturbed playbills!<br /><br />\""John Charles Thomas\"" JOINED THE ARMY IN THE 40's and worked with Romberg's Orchestra, had special events with Andre Kostelanetz and a special worldwide Christmas special with Kostelanetz in 1949. Romberg had one collection of his work from Columbia with Kostelanetz, one from Columbia from Al Goodman (both have disappeared). Romberg conducted a concert in Detroit with \""John Charles Thomas\"" personally to kick off the now denied 25th anniversary tour of Blossom Time, and oh yes, Amazon was hosting a site that reported a 1945 radio broadcast of Jerome Kern tunes was made by EARL. NO. It was made by JOHN CHARLES THOMAS, and none of those albums can be found!<br /><br />What is the serious mistake made by this album? On the back it states \""Mr. Wrightson joins her (Ms. Hunt) in \""All the Things You Are\"" from the 1939 production \""Very Warm In May\"" WHICH WAS KERN'S LAST SCORE FOR BROADWAY.\"" (emphasis added) THIS IS NOT TRUE, and was known not to be true by the time of the 1946 Show Boat! True, Kern died in 1945, however, Show Boat was supposed to open in 1945, and was put off, the score was written, and a new piece added that Kern has recieved full credit for. This collection was made by 1945, and notes were prepared, perhaps, but when a set of pieces are collected and when they are released are two totally different matters! BEFORE 1959 this new piece was recorded and discussed extensively. HOW DID THEY GET AWAY WITH THIS?<br /><br />I have obtained on vinyl and shellac multiple copies of \""Goodman's\"" \""Jerome Kern Melodies\"". They are COPYWRITTEN 1933! The albums themselves can be dated directly by scientific means as well. First, is knowing when Goodman moved on. He tries to convince that because one song was used in a 1944 movie, it is a current album. NOT SO! Ira Gershwin in 1930 gave a full page article on his writing habits, and they included the fact that he would work on some pieces and store them, including working them out with a singer, whose input he felt invaluable. These he just kept, until the right project came along. These are recorded circa 1933-4. They do not have what is called \""microgroove technology\"" which the next set of records done by Mr. Goodman for Columbia had, and have an extremely limited bandwidth, making JOSEPH TONER, not EARL WRIGHTSON, sound like he is a mouse. If you have any doubt just listed to the \""RED MILL\"" being downloaded by Amazon! Do you know why they do not download MOONBEAMS? When \""EARL\"" ruined an historic recording he and the family of the then current Stones said it was not written by Victor Herbert!<br /><br />\""JOSEPH TONER, BROADWAY LEGEND\"" is the singer of this material under the pseudonym of \""JOHN CHARLES THOMAS\"", and the world has been duped as to what that man really sang in the 40's!<br /><br />He sang Romberg's works that are in \""A Night With Sigmund Romberg\"" which wasthe actual name of Romberg's show for the military. He was a member of the Air Force (special division).He gave the 1945 tribute to Jerome Kern. He was part of a series of music of Gershwin. He sang a lot of material by modern (at the time) artists.  Wrightson had the audacity to use a known song that Joseph Toner IE JCT sang on air, on TV! It was recently put on ITunes, but happens to be the flip side of \""The Army Air Force\"" which Toner sang but was not given credit for either as JCT or as Joseph Toner. JCT sang the STUDENT PRINCE \""SERENADE\"", the 1946 version of \""DESERT SONG\"" and other related Romberg recordings, etc. Note that Romberg was recording Friml, Kern, Rodgers, Victor Herbert - oh and one thing, THINE ALONE by JCT is gone too- among others, and recordings now said to be BRUNSWICK or other ancient companies were done by EUGENE ORMANDY, others falsified as various different companies, some conflicting depending on the country the falsified album went to! Red Seal Century says that JCT started with them in 1934! I have the documents from Victor themselves that say that 1934 was just \""JCT\""'s first introduction to the Metropolitan Opera, but that is not true either. It was 1920.<br /><br />Why do I claim that it is JOSEPH TONER that is the real Earl Wrightson? It is a simple matter to prove that \""Earl Wrightson\"" the 1st and 2nd stole music from John Charles Thomas. e.g. it was JCT who sang POLONAISE, and then both POLONAISE and EILEEN, in RED SEAL form were sent out of the country, with NO NAMES ATTACHED AT ALL, including the absence of Al Goodman!<br /><br />However, the specific copyright for the \""Student Prince\"" that was stolen by Earl lasted from 1926 to 1934-5. I have the documents and an old version to match Joseph Toner's from Canada, and two new versions under the new copyright. In EARL's Day, the Copyright was totally different, requiring a completely different set of pieces, which Romberg recorded. What happened? He died in 1951! Others have tried to respect his copyright, and an international album placing \""Earl's\"" album in the early 30's was issued! But I will explain all that more under the Sigmund Romberg album.<br /><br />Did \""Earl\"" sing during the 40's? YES! With Al Goodman and Jack SMITH. I forget the woman, they changed a lot. Under Columbia. Lots of Gershwin, especially noted was OF THEE I SING. ALSO noted was that Al Goodman said that they put out FIFTEEN SHOW ALBUMS TOGETHER. FIFTEEN? Romberg tried and successfully saved Blossom Time (barely, it was never put on 33 vinyl, especially after the edict in 1947 that all Blossom Time, Friml, Student Prince etc productions were the prevue of Sigmund Romberg's orchestra to add to the Armed Forces Radio Programs.

That in itself is an interesting premise: a `compendium' or `a book formed by drawing existing content from several related Packt titles. In other words,<br /><br />it is a mash-up of published Packt content - Professional Expertise Distilled in the true sense. Such a compendium of Packt's content allows you to learn from each of the chapters' unique styles and Packt does its best to compile the chapters without breaking the narrative flow for the reader.'<br /><br />This idea might be valuable. Offer a medley of 'samplings' from various books, perhaps to bring together all tips in a certain area (say security or governance) or all content for specific roles or to help readers make a choice between several books he or she may be interested in. However, this book does not really achieve nor even seem to have the intention for that. The chapters are not showcases for the books they are taken from (there is no indication in the chapter to explain which book they are taken from and what more that book has to offer). The target audience for the book is not very clear either: many chapters are probably food for architects, but then some are more targeted at developers while others are so high level and introductory that perhaps IT managers or business folk new to the areas of SOA and integration are best served by them.<br /><br />The preface warns the reader that \""the chapters in this compendium were originally written and intended as a part of various separate Packt titles, so you might find that the information included in this instance is more akin to that of a stand-alone chapter, rather than creating step-by-step, continuous flowing prose.\"" That is a fair warning. And since all authors are knowledgeable and write well, the chapters were quite similar in style. But of course, a book composed of chapters takes from various books cannot be read as a back-to-back-story but instead will be more like an essay-bundle or a reference guide. I feel that bundle of essays is the best way to describe the most logical way to process this book. Some chapters might have had their use as reference material too - the more technically detailed ones - but these have suffered the most from the progress of time and the evolution of technology since first they were written.<br /><br />Some of these books were released as long ago as 2007, and that is one of the problems I have with this book. While it contains a lot of valuable content, it also contains many sections that are simply outdated and not relevant anymore. Chapter 14 for example relies on tutorials and software that the reader should download from Oracle Technology Network (OTN); however, that content has been unavailable for several years. When this compendium was put together (December 2011), a simple check by the editor would have made that clear.<br /><br />Many other references in the later chapters are to SOA Suite 10g and JDeveloper 10g, releases now quite long in the past, as is OpenESB - an open source project that does no longer exist (and did not in December 2011, the time of compiling this book). The chapters on JBI (Java Business Integration) have lost most of their relevance - given the events around Sun Microsystems.<br /><br />Content<br /><br />Having said all that, you may wonder what is in the book? Let dive in a little.<br /><br />Chapters 1 and 2 have a lot of overlap. They both introduce many terms, acronyms, challenges and patterns from the world of integration at application, enterprise and inter-enterprise level. In an at times almost scientific manner - with lots of literature references - a fairly factual overview and explanation is given of many aspects of EAI and SOA. These chapters were probably used in their respective original books as the foundation tobuild the book on. As such, there is a bit of repetition between the two. They also do not get very practical but rather discuss concepts in conceptual (!), theoretical way. Chapter 1 talks about the Trivadis Integration Architecture Blueprint that reappears in chapter 3. Nowhere is explained what exactly that is and why it is mentioned (probably one of the consequences of taking these chapters from their original context).<br /><br />Chapter 3 discusses Base Technologies - a list of standards (primarily though not exclusively) from the world of Java/J(2)EE) and more detailed architectural concepts for example for transactions. It is a fairly short chapter, no more than a primer for readers new to integration architecture with very readable, one page introductions to for example OSGi, JCA and JBI.<br /><br />Chapter 4 is a deep dive compared to the previous chapters. It discusses XML as the vehicle for most integration implementations. As such it discusses tools for creating XML Schemas and tips for designing XML Schemas. Note: at this stage, Web Services have hardly been introduced; it remains a little unclear how the XML should be exchanged and where the XML Schema Designs exactly come in. The tips on namespace definitions and XSD design are very useful - and probably the most concrete and relevant ones in the entire compendium. I like this chapter in that sense. I am surprised that the term `canonical schema' is not used (but that is probably related to the provenance of this chapter) and while XSLT is discussed, XQuery is strangely absent. Standards like JAXB and JAX-WS are mentioned but not introduced, which makes the discussion of the programmatic creation and processing of XML documents somewhat incomplete.<br /><br />Funny enough, this chapter does not mention JDeveloper or Oracle tools at all - while other chapters seem only to recognize Oracle's technology. It does however contain this line on StAX: \""The StAX project was started by BEA with support from Sun Microsystems, and the JSR 173 specification.\"" [sic]<br /><br />Chapter 5 is introduced with the objective to \""Leverage the orchestration capability of Oracle BPEL Process Manager to enable standards.based business process integration that complements traditional EAI middleware.\"" It describes in great detail how BPEL can be used to execute a business process and orchestrate the interaction with two existing ERP systems (Siebel CRM and SAP) in this example through the interaction points exposed by Tibco and webMethods respectively. The exact technology and tools used in this chapter are quite outdated by now - and all the detailed instructions on how to to things can safely be ignored. However, the overall approach and the design of this integration solution and even by and large the role of BPEL in it is still applicable (even though of course BPEL is just one of many ways to approach it).<br /><br />Chapter 6 seems to be doing something very similar as chapter 5; this chapters does a step by step approach for \""integrating PeopleSoft 8.9 CRM with Oracle Applications 11i using BPEL.\"" I do not feel like chapter 6 adds more than a repeat of chapter 5 and again the tools used in this chapter are no longer in use.<br /><br />Chapters 7 and 8 are well written, probably the best and most clear introduction to JBI I have ever seen and read. Unfortunately, the relevance of JBI especially in association with NetBeans and GlassFish & OpenESB is a little uncertain at this point, to put it mildly. Unfortunately, OpenESB does not longer exist, the JBI support in GlassFish is dead and latest releases of NetBeans do not support JBI either. I fear JBI is on its way out and these chapters are probably not worth the reader's time anymore.<br /><br />Chapter 9 is titled \""SOA and Web Services Approach for Integration\"" is a bit back to chapters 1 and 2: introduction of IT challenges, reiteration of integration patterns, before it comes to stating the case for Web Services and listing aseries of \""application patterns\"". The chapter finishes off with a discussion on the design of interoperable web services - including concrete WSDL snippets and XSD fragments as well as the concrete implementation of WebServices and Clients using both Java/JEE and C#/.NET. This part of the chapter fits in well with chapter 4, and is among the most concrete (and still relevant) sections of the book.<br /><br />Chapter 10 has again some overlap - with chapter 9. It is titled \""Service- and Process-Oriented Approach to Integration Using Web Services\"". It introduces the challenges in integration and explains why EAI is not enough and then introduces the Enterprise Service Bus. ESB as an architecture pattern and an infrastructure is discussed at length. The functions represented in an ESB are made clear and the various flows of messages through and process executions in the ESB are illustrated. Until deep into this chapter, no specific ESB product is introduced and the discussion is purely conceptual - and good too. At some point, the author reveals his colors: JBI is the container that he has in mind and the Service Engine architecture of JBI is the way he envisions the ESB concepts to be implemented. Still, most even of this part of the chapter is relevant in the presence of other ESB products as well. The chapter is a long one - 90 pages - and I think it is pretty good. It should probably have come a little earlier on in the book and some of its contents make parts of at least chapters 1 and 2 redundant. For anyone contemplating service based integration and the introduction of an ESB, it is excellent reading and that applies as well to current users of ESB technology who want to validate their current approach and look for improvements.<br /><br />Chapter 11 is a fairly detailed example of using Oracle Service Bus for achieving decoupling. The chapter starts with a fine expose on what types of coupling exist and what strategies can be applied to reduce the extent of coupling. One good example is a search operation in a web service that not only accepts search criteria but also meta-data that specify the `batch of search results' to return - to retrieve search results in multiple sets of say 10 or 20 records. The chapter presents the WSDL and XSD for such a service that can offer functionality that does not rely on state being retained by the service yet helps to simulate a multi-request conversation. The second part of the chapter introduces OSB. Unfortunately and a little surprising, it does not explain the implementation of the 'search with state' service discussed in the chapter, but a very basic service instead (without demonstrating a test invocation of the service, which would have made it more tangible). Of course it is only the reader's first introduction to OSB - so very complex examples are not in order. As a newbie reader by the way, I would be thoroughy confused at this point: we have seen BPEL being used for these integration patterns, read a dicussion of a JBI based service container, seen basic Java and C# baed Web Service implementations and now this OSB example. The rationale for when to use which tool and the disparity between the tools is a tough act to follow.<br /><br />Chapter 12 is about the next level of integration - from low level pure XML based EAI (chapter 4) and synchronous service interactions without or with ESB via the process (or at least orchestration) based complex ERP integration with BPEL (in chapters 5 and 6) it introduces BPMN for true Business Process design and implementarion. Its title is Integrating BPEL with BPMN using BPM Suite . Note that this chapter is very much about the Oracle BPM Suite 11g, not so much about BPMN in general. It is one of the most recent chapters (I believe from the SOA Suite 11g Developer book by Matt and Anthony). It builds on the elaborate introduction of the SOA Suite 11g design time and run time environment and the development of SCA composite application they provide earlier on in that book. For the readers of only the compendium, it may be a big leap. Additionally, the example in chapter 12 of designing and implementing a BPMN process builds on services developed earlier on in the book this chapter is taken from. Readers of just the compendium will be wondering where certain services - for example the EmployeeTravelStatus service - appear from. Of course in order to deploy and test the Composite Application on the BPM/SOA Suite 11g run time, the reader needs instructions on where to get the software and how to get it installed. However, this chapter does not provide such instructions nor does it refer the reader in any way. Although I am impressed - as someone well versed in SOA Suite and BPM Suite - how much material the authors have been able to squeeze into this chapter, it must be a challenging roller coaster ride for a reader not already familiar at least with the latest Oracle tooling for SOA.<br /><br />Note the chapter states \""Oracle SOA Suite 11g PS2 introduces an interesting new feature--BPMN 2.0 execution engine\"" which is not entirely the best way of putting it: on top of SOA Suite 11g, one has to acquire an impressively priced additional license for BPM Suite 11g in order to get access to the BPMN based functionality.<br /><br />Chapter 13 - SOA Integration--Functional View, Implementation, and Architecture - starts with a little reiteration: chapter 1 and 2, a little bit of chapter 3, and many other chapters besides are repeated to some extent in chapter 13. What this chapter adds is the link with legacy applications running on mainframes and how to integrate with those. It does so using technology from Oracle - and a fairly old generation of the Oracle stack - all predating the BEA acquisition and subsequent migration of Oracle's middleware to WebLogic Server. Most of the solutions described though will still be valid, using today's set of products. The chapter also describes mainframe interaction `the IBM way' (briefly) because, as it writes, \""No chapter on Legacy SOA Integration can be written without considering the IBM mainframe hardware and software that have an impact on Legacy SOA integration.\""<br /><br />Chapter 14 seems to be the direct successor to chapter 13: \""We are now going to show an example in detail for--Web Enablement. We will use JSP, JDBC, the Oracle Legacy Adapter, Oracle Application Server, Java EE Connector API, and XA transaction processing to show a two-phase commit across an Oracle database and VSAM on the mainframe.\"" This chapter demonstrates how - again, using somewhat outdated technology- a Java web application can be created with data taken from the mainframe. The reader is refered to OTN to find white papers and tutorials that help set the scene for this chapter. Unfortunately, those resources are no longer available at this moment. Another set of tools that this chapter relies on quite heavily is the Relativity tool set (RMW Application Analyzer, RMW SOA Analyzer, RMW Architect, RMW Business Rule Manager) ; this set helps analysis of mainframe COBOL applications for the purpose of exposing them in a SOA environment (or at least that is my understanding). The URLs provide in this chapter are unfortunately no longer valid. Details on Relativity can be found though at: [...] The chapter provides a very detailed overview of inspecting a legacy COBOL application and describes how to open it up with Oracle Legacy Adapter to allow its integration through a JCA connection opened from a Java Web application (without using ESB, OSB or BPEL). For readers with a COBOL background or interest, I suppose this is all valuable. To the rest of us, it is too much detail in my opinion.<br /><br />After chapter 14 there is another section, one of the most interesting of the book in fact. However, for some reason that does not become clear, it is not a chapter but an Appendix instead. Appendix A - Establishing SOA Governance at Your Organization. The topic is important enough to warrant a real chapter - or perhaps Appendix means place of honor. The discussion to my taste should have started with a discussion of the objectives - what do we want to achive with governance. Other than that, I consider it a good discussion of the roles involved and the areas and topics involved. It primarily explains what should be taken care of, not necessarily how that could be done. But still, Governance is frequently overlooked so I am glad with this appendix.<br /><br />To the end of the appendix, some tools and technologies that may aid in implementing Governance are briefly discussed, on a conceptual level, not naming any specific tools (except when Microsoft BizTalk and Windows Communication Foundation are briefly - and quite redundantly as far as I am concerned- are mentioned).<br /><br />Best of Packt<br /><br />The suffix to the title - Best of Packt - is simply not true. The good folks at Packt do themselves an injustice with this tagline. I have read recent publications from Packt in the area of SOA that are excellent and contain material that is better than what is in this publication. I can only surmise that since these titles are still current, Packt decided it to be commercially unsound to use (much) content from these titles in this `Best of Packt' compendium. Instead, less current content was used.<br /><br />It seems that this publication was not so much seen as an opportunity to update and refine existing content, and correct mistakes or outdated sections, but rather to make some additional money from work otherwise forgotten.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />The short of it: given the size of the book (700 pages) and the many parts that are useful it is still reasonable value for money (at least the eBook). However, if Packt really wanted to publish `the best of Packt on SOA and Integration' they could have provided us with much better, more up to date content and ensured that the pieces have a better mutual fit with less overlap.",2012-02-26,3050,extra_long,2012-02,ebooks

No character development at all so you don't care at all what happens to the unfortunate humans in this sad excuse for a movie. The main antagonist is an alien that somehow became a \""hybrid\"" when it impregnated a predator. Seriously? Somehow when a predator gets face-hugged the alien can become a hybrid? Okay... whatever. Totally disregard any pretense of actually sticking with any part of the \""Alien\"" back-story. Maybe if the viewers had never seen an Alien movie we could get past that...<br /><br />The hybrid also somehow has the ability to bypass the whole \""egg laying\"" process that normal aliens have and can implant multiple eggs into hosts by giving them a big sloppy kiss. Let's try to ignore how far out and ridiculous that is, and how much is screws the whole \""Alien\"" concept even more, but the directors of this lamentable use of film decided that this hybrid needed to prance through a maternity ward and give eggs to multiple pregnant women. It was heart-breaking. Overly gory. Revolting.

I will do 2002 in film & 20 years ago on my other account. But I'm going to review a movie that wasn't wanted & wasn't needed at all. As you know it's this movie The Thing prequel, premake preboot it is what it is it's a back door remake. Let me tell you all why this movie was completebulls h i t. Back iin 2004 John Carpenter wanted to do a sequel to The Thing Universal said no Carpenter said this to Empire Magazine in October of 04 \""I have a great story for part 2 which kicks off with the 2 characters left alive from the last movie. I'm interested in doing it. Unfortantly I dont't think Universal is. Well there interested in doing it but there not interested in having me direct it! You know that the studio will end getting some commercials hotshot to direct it & that will be that. I don't care I'm certaintly not going to beg. Despite the fact that these people don't even get The Thing even though it is it's a favorite film of my own.\"" He's right they got some tool in Mattijs van Henijnigen like the drink only not spelled the same. This gy has directed Zien & Red Rain Red Rain was a short film from 96. Zien was a musical from 2004 he has about as much credibillity directing a horror movie let alone a prequel to 1 of the best horror movies ever made as George Tillman did directing an action movie. So Universal said no NO! To a sequel directed by John Carpenter & Kurt Russell & Keith David returning in favor of a prequel. I'm sorry I hate prequels imo there not needed the only time a prequel is good is if it's Missing In Action 2, Psycho IV, He l lraise Bloodline which serves as a sequel & a prequel both or Terminalor Salvation which again is a prequel & sequel both. The movie stars Mary Elizabeth Weinstead as Kate Lloyd & I'd be lying if I said she was complete s h i t but I didn't care about her character 1 way or the other. Also stars Joel Edgerton as Sam Carter, Ulrich Thmpsen  as Dr Sander Halverson & Eric Christen Olsen as Adam, Now if you love this movie & think it is a wonderful companion piece then be my guest but don't try to comment & tell that it's good this is my opinion. Ok so you start off these 3 Norwegians have discovered an Alien Body frozen in the ice & right off the bat you have 1 of these Norweigians tell a joke. \""A man & a woman are doing it 1 night & there young son comes in & is horrified. The Woman says what do we do? Then the man says I'll take care of this. The man finds his son on top of his Grandmother & he tells his dad it ain't so funny when it's your mother.\"" I pause right there & I stared cussing I was like WTF!? But then you're introduced to Kate Lloyd & the guy from NCIS LA & Dr Halverson. The Norwegians have found something so The Norwegians need an American to go to Antartica to tell them with the proper tools it will take half a day.. Really it's to have the final girl. I wouldn't know that was taking place in 1982 if it didn't say so at the beginning. Kate is listening to Who Could It Be Now by Men At Work cause it has to do with paranoia that's so brillant ha ha. The opening reminds me of AvP in it's look & feel cause they found something in Antartica & you have your Ellen Ripley knock off, So these group of Americans go to Antartica they get The Alien out of the ice & I swear to G o d you mean to tell me that they couldn't even get a real block of ice the had to use CGI. So there celebrating the find you have this guy looking at the ice some other guy comes from behind & says boo. Literally he says boo. So the creature breaks through the ice then you have that guy run down the hall in the same exact way as in The 82 film & you have a dog biting on the cage. You have these people looking for The Thing a tentical goes through this 1 guy & pulls in they set it on fire & kill it & try to figure out what is going on & this is the only time you get pratical effects when they have the body on the table so you have Kate who took a blood sample she finds out  that it can copy human cells perfecly just like this movie perfectly copies The 82 film. When they were looking at creature they had burned they found a metal object in it & it was from that guy that was killed earlier cause he had surgery on his arm. So later on this guy got sick he has to be taken out of the area Kate finds some teeth fillings in the bathroom cause The Thing can't assimlate metal. She tries to get Sam Carter to land The Helicopter 1 guy transforms into a creature in some turely awful CGI. The Helicopter crashes & we think Sam & The Helicopter piolet are dead. Kate tells everybody that they can't leave & that The Thing is coping it's vicims like I didn't already know that from The 82 movie. So then you have this 1 girl taking to Kate & then you get another horrid CGI transformation. That creature is burned. Then Sam & The Helicopter Piolet come back. They decided to do a blood test I already knew that going to the lab is torched. Cause Kate looks at there teeth to find out that there not human open your mouth. You find out that none of these people are infected & you know not everybody has teeth fillings by this movies logic if you don't have teeth filling you'refv c k e d. Sam & The Helicopter Piollet escaped they all run into them The Helicopter Piolet shoots this 1 guys Flamethrower Tank it blows up. They take this guy who is hurt to The REC room just like The 82 movie & we get some s h i t CGI transformation you have the low Flamethrower Fuel scene recreated The Windows death scene copied from The 82 film. The Thing kills The Helicopter Piolet gut it crawls up to a wounded Adam & rubs it's face up to his & never in a million years would I have thought that the body they found in The 82 mvoie woudl be part of the dip s h it from Dumb & Dumberer & NCIS LA. You have Dr Halverson escap cause he is infected they follow him which leads to a medioce fanale with Kate & The Thing. She throws a grenade in it's mouth & it dies. If the space ship worked all along why WHY oh why did it just go there The Thing is suppose to be Stealthy & don't tell me that oh this thing is brand new it's learning. In The Documentary Carpetnter says that it's been around for 1,000 of years theres no fan fiction allowed in this dojo. Anyway Kate tells Sam you know who I knew you were human your ear ring she burns him & WOW! The Final Girl I haven't seen that before in except for 50 other fv c k in g horror movies. That Sam guy mentioned that we need to get to The Russian Outpost they never mentioned that in The 82 film & in thiis film they never mentioned The American Outpost. Then OMG this Helicopter lands at The Norwegian Base then all of a sudden a dog pops out of it there was only 1 dog & it was killed so where did it come from so they chased it down the ending of that was the start of the 82 film & if I didn't rent this I would've broken the disc & I got it with a gift card thankfully. This movie is a disgrace it is an insault to John Carpetnter it's an insautl to me being a massive fan of the 1982 film I even liked the original The Thibg From Another World so I know that The Thing was a remake but you know what it became it's own movei not a carbon copy. A movie I'll mention Levithatn it gets s h i t on people complain that it is a ripoff of Alien & The Thing I'm sorry it had characters that you cared about Peter Weller Richard Crenna, Ernie Hudson, Amanda Pays, Lisa Eilbacher & Daniel Stern. It had an inferction plot but it was underwater & did enough where it became it's own movie. Levithan didn't haves # ! t effects that looked like video game graphichs. The writer even said pratical effects will be used whenever possible wtf ever the only time I saw pratical was on the autopsy table maybe. I'm hard on CGI most of the time cause pratical effects look better effects from an almost 30 year old movie look better than anything today. It's sad that old school pratical effects are being phased out in favor of CGI. CGI was never ment to replace old school pratical effects it was to be used to do the impsooible like in T2 & The Abyss.CGI will never ever ever ever ever top pratical effects by the masters like Rob Bottin, Rick Baker, K&B John Carl Bechler & The Late Stan Winston. & please don't tell me that CGI is better cause you will just get c us se d out. The characters are forgetable Kate Lloyd is just another final girl. Joel Edgerton doesn't do much he's barley in the movie & he has 2nd billing. Eric Christen Olsen is a wimp. Urlich Thompsen is nothing special. Why was this movie made we didn't need to know what happend to The Norwegian's we know enogh that someF U B AR I N G went on. So if you want to know what happend to The Norwegian's just watch the 1st 15 or 20 minutes of John Carpenters The Thing. Don't tell me that it's a story that needed to be told a story that needed to be told was a sequel with John Carpenter coming back to direct with Kurt Russell returning. I mean think of the possibilities of The Thing in a city or The Thing in a deset or The Thing in a jungle. So this was a cash iin with 1 note characters video game graphic effects & a plot I don't care about. I remember MacReady, Windows, Norris, Dr Blair, Childs, Nauls, Gerry & Palmer why cause I cared about them. I remember The Dog transformation scene Infermary Scene The Norris transformation scene I remeber a lot of scenes.

American orchestras have priced themselves out of making more than a handful of recordings, and it would be a boon if the Web turned into a saving grace.<br /><br />Here from Oct. 1-3, 2009 is a concert which was broadcast on PBS, I recall. I don't remember the entire program, but this release consists of the Symphonie fantastique and a new commission, Magnus Lindberg's ten-minute overture, EXPO. the overture is bright, fast, and appealing, a sort of update to works like Barber's vivacious School for Scandal Over. but with the skittering 'moto perpetuo' and up-and-down surge of Adams' Short Ride in a Fast Machine. Lindberg was clearly out to entertain, and with its chugging energy and intermittent fanfares, EXPO deserves to stay around, hampered only by its opaque title.<br /><br />There is no need for another Symphonie fantastique in the catalog, but fans of the Philharmonic will want to hear them play it. Leonard Bernstein made a specialty of this work and produced two recordings with the orchestra, both of them exciting, world-class performances. Gilbert's is musical, straightforward, and middle-of-the-road. He is a technician with a penchant for tidiness and elegance (in the mode of Michael Tilson Thomas), and on the basis of the orchestra's beautiful playing, captured in excellent sound, this is an enjoyable reading. The first movement is taken briskly, with a minimum of rubato. The avoidance of swooning and swaying is welcome, but the overall effect is a bit efficient. The work is about dream and hallucination, after all.<br /><br />Un bal also clips along with a spring in its step and minimal shaping or pausing. (the version without cornets is being used.) So far, Gilbert's interpretation verges on the matter-of-fact. The Scene aux champs features a beautifully played interplay between oboe and English Horn, one of Berlioz's most magical inventions, and at 15 min. one cannot say that Gilbert rushes it. He settles into the pastoral atmosphere, even if the air of efficiency continues to linger. The brisk pacing works best in the Marche au supplice, even if it isn't particularly grim or frightening. We could be marching to a drunken picnic as easily as to the scaffold. finally, the witches' sabbath movement, which was a highlight under Munch, who took every opportunity for Halloween mischief, as written into Berlioz's remarkable orchestration. Gilbert is more quietly spooky, intent on keeping the score moving, as he has been since the beginning. the midnight chimes are very tame tubular bells.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very enjoyable Fantastique, and its briskness is an unusual approach, but the essence of fervid romanticism has been missed - or not aimed at, to be fair.n verges on the matter-of-fact.

First, please note I did NOT buy this product when first released.  I purchased it yesterday, after an amazing 6 updates/patches had been released by Intuit.  I can understand the frustration ... who releases a product only to patch it six times within a month?!?!?  Anyway, the patches seem to have worked ... at least for me.  I encountered no problems converting my Quicken Premier 2011 data to Premier 2013.  I also experienced minor headaches with the mobile feaure.  That said, my wife loves the mobile feature, as she is now able to enter her transactions in real-time through her iPhone and sync the data when she arrives at home.  She loves not having to put in receipts when she gets home.  So, this, alone, seems to make this purchase worthwhile.<br /><br />There are some other incremental upgrades from the 2011 product I've noticed, but none of them would have moved me to buy the 2013 version.  The only reason for the purchase is the mobile/sync aspect of the program, although we have experienced a couple minor headaches regarding the feature, which were sufficient to knock off a star.<br /><br />Hope all of you who had problems with the program following initial release have been able to resolve them through the numerous patches released by Intuit.

This was fantastic!<br /><br />In the last book Amelia got a deeper taste of darkness as well as some answers to her questions about her past. She may have discovered who her birth mother was, but there's still far more questions about what she's capable of and what exactly that means to her. The previous book also left off with a text message from Devlin, which of course means that her relationship with him will figure heavily into this book.<br /><br />Fans of Amelia and Devlin's relationship will be glad to see some progress made in this book as well as progress with Shani and Mariama. (Not saying how far it goes, but there is definite progress.) I have to admit that I wasn't as fond of him in this book as I was in the first one and I have to say that I hope that he manages to move on more from his past so Amelia can finally have a love interest that isn't overly invested in a past love. Then again, I think that this might be due to some of his actions in the book, which involves him cuddling with another woman earlier in the book and then kissing Amelia later on. This does get explained in some format later on in the book, but it definitely makes me raise an eyebrow as to how Devlin could so easily do this. I know that there's a magnetism between Devlin and Amelia, but so far she's the only one doing any compromising. A soul mate-esque connection can only go so far and Devlin needs to show that he's worthy of Amelia. I can't wait for Thane to make a reappearance later on in the series. (Of course I think he's coming back- he's too good to only appear once!) He took Amelia's abilities in stride and I felt that he gave her an acceptance that Devlin only grudgingly gives her.<br /><br />Other than that, I really enjoyed the read- especially the look into the supernatural angle of the book. Part of the supernatural focus in this book was vodun and Stevens seems to have really done her homework here and tries to avoid an overly Hollywood depiction of the religion. It's good that she does this, as this is a religion/practice that really doesn't need to be gussied up to the nth level. It can do that on its own. This is really part of the charm of this series. Rather than give us a completely fantastical version of magic and the supernatural, Stevens tries to be as realistic as she can without being over the top.<br /><br />We get a pretty intriguing new character here by the name of Darius Goodwine, a darkpractitioner of vodun with big (read evil) plans for Amelia. Darius is shown as a sinister and evil force here, but there seems to be other aspects to his character that haven't been shown and I can't wait to discover them.<br /><br />This is a good addition to the series and while it wasn't as \""OMG!

Inside said package was the brand new long player from Italy's own rock revivalists Mojo Filter. Mrs. Love Revolution is 10 songs that pretty much encapsulate a critical period in rock and roll music. This album is a tribute to classic rock, from Italy with love.<br /><br />Mojo Filter consists of Alessandro Battistini on vocals and guitar, Carlo Lancini on guitars, Daniele Togni on bass and Jennifer Longo on drums. Starting the album off with 'Just Like A Soldier', Mojo Filter wears their influences proudly on their Versace sleeve. This is a four on the floor rocker with the Stones and the Black Crowes hovering above the proceedings in approval.  'No Comment Please' starts out like something off of the Black Keys Magic Potion, but quickly steps back about 30 years and raids Zeppelin's 'Black Dog' and 'The Crunge' for some riff heavy magic.  Led Zeppelin and Cream play heavily on the sound throughout Mrs. Love Revolution. Lots of big riffs and wah pedal funkiness collide with the tight rhythm section to make this an enjoyable listen for anyone pining for that lost Vanilla Fudge or CCR BBC session. Speaking of Creedence Clearwater Revival, 'The River' pulls almost directly from CCR's 'Born on the Bayou' for a swampy, extended groove that lasts maybe a minute or two too long. From the river we head to the country with 'Las Vegas', a hoedown of a track.  Complete with slide guitar and a chick'n pick'n guitar solo in the middle, 'Las Vegas' is a nice break from the power chord guitar riffage that permeates this release.  Old school Let It Bleed fans will be reminded of 'Country Honk' when hearing this foot stomper. Sound-wise, this a great sounding record.  A very clean production, while still retaing the feeling that this is four individuals jamming in the studio.  Mojo Filter got some help from American producer Jono Manson, who's worked with the Spin Doctors and John Popper of Blues Travelers fame.<br /><br />At times, listening to Mojo Filter's Mrs. Love Revolution I'm reminded of how certain things in this world have a hard time translating from one language to another.

The movie has some well executed action scenes, and poignant emotional moments, but the overall story has a few rough spots.  Major spoilers follow.<br /><br />Olga Kurylenko ([[ASIN:B001PPLIFU Quantum of Solace]]]) plays Galia, a Ukrainian working in America for the Russian mob as an escort.  She and a co-worker attempt to escape from their masters, but are recaptured, and brutally beaten.  The other woman is murdered, but Galia pleads with her gangster boss Mishka for a chance at freedom, and surprisingly her wish is granted.  In return for shooting someone, she will be freed from the sex trade.<br /><br />Galia dreams of going back to Ukraine, to be with her young daughter.  Faced with a tough choice, a terrified Galia completes her first assignment, and in return is allowed to live in a shabby apartment.  She is occasionally called on to eliminate a target, but otherwise, her time is mostly her own.  Galia discovers that her neighbor Eleanor (Ninette Tayeb), a clerk at a market, is being abused by her husband, and the women form a friendship borne from a common language (Hebrew) and their mutual hardships.  Matters eventually reach a critical point, as each of them attempt to escape from their respective nightmares, leading to an explosion of violence.<br /><br />Despite any language barrier, Olga Kurylenko seems to be a very capable actress.  The special relationship that develops between Eleanor and Galia becomes the heart of the film.  While they have their ups and downs, there are some special and genuinely tender moments.  Tayeb and Kurylenko are terrific in their scenes together, which often feature very natural sounding and thoughtful dialog, usually spoken in broken English.<br /><br />One of the movie's strong points is the exciting and often brutal action scenes, however logic and consistency is an issue.  The brutality and ruthlessness that the film opens with, sets the tone, which is mostly sustained through Galia's first mission, although trusting her with a loaded weapon makes little sense.  After this less than rousing success, matters strangely seem to shift in Galia's favor, as she begins to rebel and make demands, and then is cut a lot of slack, after she fails to complete an assignment.<br /><br />This \""softening\"" by the Russian thugs doesn't make much sense, as attempts to disobey are typically crushed mercilessly.  Mishka has no problems with murdering people in public, and has plenty of muscle to accomplish what Galia is reluctant to do, so his waiting around for her to \""get with the program\"", seems completely ridiculous.  Galia eventually has the courage to take on the gang, but then returns to the first place they will look for her, where she and Eleanor have to make a bloody escape.

The brutality and ruthlessness that the film opens with, sets the tone, which is mostly sustained through Galia's first mission, although trusting her with a loaded weapon makes little sense.  After this less than rousing success, matters strangely seem to shift in Galia's favor, as she begins to rebel and make demands, and then is cut a lot of slack, after she fails to complete an assignment.<br /><br />This \""softening\"" by the Russian thugs doesn't make much sense, as attempts to disobey are typically crushed mercilessly.  Mishka has no problems with murdering people in public, and has plenty of muscle to accomplish what Galia is reluctant to do, so his waiting around for her to \""get with the program\"", seems completely ridiculous.

Did you like grand theft auto III, IV, & San Andreas? Did you like Prototype? If you like the 3rd person shooter games where you roam the city blowing stuff up, running over pedestrians, smacking prostitutes, driving souped up cars, and flying around in hover jets.. then you will absolutely love this game. The pro reviews, while somewhat well received, undervalued the playability and fun factor of this game.<br /><br />I have all the downloadable content so my review is from that perspective.<br /><br />Sound track: is immense. Like GTA as you drive around you can flip through radio stations to hear modern music or import your own.<br /><br />Voice overs: are excellently done. The girls are sexy, the guys are bad ass, the cops are whining nerds. Just as it should be.<br /><br />Weapons: there are dozens to choose from and you can upgrade them all. Big shotguns, dual wielding SMG's, Air strikes, tanks, fighter jets, attack helicopters, mind control devices, vehicle control devices. Upgrading them can increase ammo capacity, fire rate, targeting abilities, or even the type of ammo from armor piercing to anti-personnel. With the vehicle control device you can upgrade it to control and detonate military vehicles. Of course you can control military vehicles directly as well.<br /><br />Main quest: is great and fast paced. The difficulty scales well. The guns, sound track, voice overs, and character development all comes together to just make a fun brawl.<br /><br />Side quests: there are tons of them and they are all fun.. ramming through people with a burning 3 wheeler, throwing yourself in front of traffic for insurance money, delivering prostitutes, and causing as much damage as possible with a tank to name a few.<br /><br />Car are fast and handle well. You can customize them like crazy. There are motorcycles, suburbans, BMW's, Porsche's, Lamborghini's, econo-boxes, mo-peds, news vans, cement trucks, big rigs, and many others.<br /><br />There is a huge variety of character customization. You can have a floppy tittied bimbo wearing pink spandex, or a fat old balding biker dude wearing a gimp hat, or a skinny nerd wearing heart boxers and a tube top with a bunny hat wielding a giant dildo into combat. You can buy tattoo parlors to get tatted up. You can buy cosmetic facilities and totally alter your character at any time, if you want to go from that floppy tittied bimbo to the fat biker mid-game, or vice versa, you can do that.<br /><br />You earn money and experience by doing quests, killing enemy gangsters, and just driving wildly. Almost every action will earn you some kind of reward, which is.. rewarding.<br /><br />You can purchase properties which earn you money.<br /><br />With money and experience you can upgrade your character to have more health, carry more ammo, be able to call in vehicle deliveries, deliver you a helicopter, call in gang buddies to help out in fire fights, reduce damage you take, etc.<br /><br />All in all this is a great sandbox game. The cities have a decent amount of detail but you can't enter many of the buildings. That is one thing the game is lacking. More interior environments would have been nice.. i.e. strip clubs, casinos, bars.. some stuff like that would have been a great add.<br /><br />But I'm happy.

I was disappointed because what I got was a generalized muddy account of assault rifle history, begrudging acknowledgement of the AK and a ridiculous glorification of current US military rifles. So let me help you with some facts you can use if you decide to watch this show. First- the milled receiver AK-47 from the late 1940s and the 1950s does weigh almost 12 pounds loaded- but the far more common AKM weighs only 7.9 pounds loaded. The M4 carbine we (the U.S.) use today weighs in at 7  pounds loaded but when you add optics and rails and forward grips and all that anodized, allen-screwed junk \""operators\"" add on the little thing can weigh 13 pounds! The M4 has the same flaws as the M16 which preceded it- it is undependable- has to be cleaned constantly and \""tuned up\"", messed with and mollycoddled all its life. The show failed to mention that the Heckler and Koch 416 is an M4 with a PISTON! Why? Because the U.S. Army wants to find a more dependable M4! The gas impingement system of the AR15 type rifles is just not dependable. The AK-47 is cheap- you can get one for a few hundred dollars- and the allen-screwed anodized fancy pants junk WE use today costs thousands per unit. The vaunted accuracy of the M4 is matched by other far more dependable AK type weapons (AK-74, Galil) again at less cost. We would be better off buying assault rifles from Russia or Bulgaria- both of which make purpose-built specialized rifles for every \""operator\"" need. They even make accurate suppressed assault rifles. The ridiculous contest at the end of the show did not test the strengths of AKs vs M4s but rather seemed to be an ad for our military's continued use of butt-ugly iffy small arms...",2012-04-06,322,long,2012-04,videos

I personally don't think it's that much better than your typical mmo but there is a difference and it makes tera more unique.<br /><br />The political and guild systems are pretty cool imo and have a korean mmo feel to it. Your guild can own certain regions, tax people, and fight for the right to rule and also has the guild bank where everyone can deposit but only the guild leader and certain officers can withdraw. Guilds may also declare war on up to 3 other guilds for some crazy battles and since each guild can have hundreds of people it will be interesting to see big guilds battling it out. These are features that traditional korean mmos like atlantica online had but american mmos are lacking and features I personally like.<br /><br />The quests and leveling are really nothing new and the vast majority of them consist of killing x of this and collecting y of that and report to the next quest giver for more of the same quests. There are some unique quests like tame x number of animals, escort this guy to x, or defend this area for this amount of time but for the most part you will be doing the same thing over and over again and the creatures you fight aren't even that different. You may need to dodge a little differently for each creature but they are overused. The same tiger you fought at level 10 you will fight again with a different skin at level 20. Only good thing is youwill never have to grind on creatures without quests as there are just barely enough ample quests to keep you going.<br /><br />There is very little story in this game and I have never needed to actually read the quest details other than the objective. There is also a lack of items in the game and until you reach max level, the all of you items you will be using will be from quests as the unique items dropped from monsters usually aren't any better for the same level requirement. So lets say I have a bow with 10 req i got from a quest. That bow will very likely be better than a bow with level 10 req I get as a drop from a random mob.<br /><br />The classes are also very unbalanced and changes your experience of the game pretty dramatically. I tried toe warrior which is the hardest class to play in the game and the archer which is the easiest and there is a world of difference between the two. With the archer I have never died, had use bandage/potion or even have to rest to recover hp/mana<br />because I very very rarely get damaged since creatures will never get near enough to damage me. As an archer I have 2 step back dodge abilities, a slow trap, and a chance to knock down an enemy for a couple of seconds which makes the game super easy and leveling much faster as there is no down time to heal. As a warrior I would have to heal after every couple of fights which is super annoying and come prepared with bandages. On top of that I would actually have to dodge attacks from monsters since i'm always in melee range or otherwise get penalized greatly for taking damage.<br /><br />Even in PvP or endgame despite being the hardest to play you get no benifits later on as a warrior. I dueled warriors a couple level higher than me with my archer and won most of those fights without getting a scratch. For those people who play warrior class in every mmo but want an easier time you will not like this and for those who play the ranger in every game and want a challenge this would also suck for you.<br /><br />The two PvP servers are the only ones with a decent amount of people are the most worth playing in. For those people who don't like PvP servers you will be stuck in worlds often with 1/3 or less the amount of people. Luckily PvP servers don't actually differ much from PvE and most people do not kill random low levels anyway as there is no reward for doing so unless you just find it funny but I have no encountered this yet. There have been some people who come in groups of 2-3 and disrupt soloers from questing though.<br /><br />The starting areas and quests you do for every class and race are all the same. Luckily each race/class has as pretty different feel and the combat you do will feel quite different too so it makes part for it a little.<br /><br />Overall my first impression with the game is ok and hopefully the game will just keep getting better and better. Guild wars 2 won't be out for a couple of months anyways and I think tera is better than diablo 3 as I tested that in beta so if you're on the fence on getting this game I would recommend it if you're just pretty bored but don't buy it hoping for great expectations.",2012-05-06,955,extra_long,2012-05,games

In his youth, rather than move with his kid brother and ailing mother and assume a George Baily man of the house role (It's a Wonderful Life), he remains in-town to: 1.) get training from his father denied to him when Hardy's character was around 2.) marry his high school sweetheart. Turning the corner at 30, the has-been all around failure returns to MMA to make ends meet, subsequently losing his position as a highschool physics teacher; he is a New England Walter White of Breaking Bad minus 15 years, in his own way.<br /><br />Deadbeat absentee alcoholic father (Nick Nolte) has cleaned up with AA and finds younger son on his porch. His overtures at reconciliation vacillate between hopelessly self-pitying and pathetic, and vicious ambition.<br /><br />-- -- --<br /><br />Review and Analysis by principle characters<br /><br />Hardy's darkness, the war, is completely glossed over. From his first take down of Mad Dog Grimes in the gym sparring match onwards, it had to be clear that he does not care if he kills his opponents in the ring and that that is perhaps what he aims for. Hardy represents the socioeconomic/moral blowback of the other two's actions as well as those of society (the war, the banking shenanigans). The film ends with a fraternal reconciliation offered as a memory hole cover for predatory housing loans, bailouts, war, desertion charges and personal betrayal.<br /><br />The financial compulsion/desperation of Edgerton is not felt acutely enough; the foolish vanity of not declaring bankrupcy is not utilized/explored nor the strain on the marriage made manifest by it. His idolization by his students also marks him for an Icarus-fall with them as witnesses. Edgerton's character is not a credible master tactician cum Rocky, who overcomes his physical disadvantages by biding his time. The triumph of Edgerton's huberis is the principle dramatic and moral failure of the film.<br /><br />Nolte's character has the least flawed writing and the only fully developed character in the film. The Nolte-Hardy dialectic is masterful and correctly done (he HAS to relapse, and does Hardy holds the mirror up to him), but the Nolte-Edgerton relationship was not maintained by his resentment against his father for not being the favorite son as much as was required; \""I've forgiven you Dad, -but I don't trust you.\"" As Hardy notes on the beach of the Sparta event, \""You're full of s*** man, I feel sorry for you.\"" Edgerton -the sensitive reflective guy- has the biggest chip on his shoulder of the three with the most to prove and never realizes it.<br /><br />The gains of having Edgerton's character come out on top (the son most like his mother gives the alcoholic father's favorite son a beat down and the father as well by proxy) are so grossly outweighed by other plot dimensions/possibilities that their merits are not worthy of enumeration here. Edgerton represents the American Dream as is currently understood today.

The intro is spooky good until Busta throws a hat in and it's over.  Or should have been.  Lil' Wayne's contribution I hadn't heard when my friend was playing as he mixed out beforehand and I'm holding it against him that he didn't warn me.  It's not that Wayne's an average rapper, but compared to Busta, on THIS track?  He sounds like a lagging amateur and that's how nasty Busta is here.  Add that to a tacked on and trite homosexual slam and Wayne came out the gates tried and tired.  It's not that I'm particularly sensitive to gay-bashing, but I am sensitive to worn out ignorance in general.

An alarmingly high percentage of reviewers were overtly upset about how DA2 ruined a masterpiece, some going so far as to describe it as terrible.  In the PC version, for example, over 100 of the 260 reviews are 1 or 2 stars.  I finally bought it at the discounted price of $5.  I haven't finished the game, but here is a quick review while the sale is going on.<br /><br />Strengths:<br />-This game is fun.  I really enjoy the team based mechanic and pausing the game to assign different characters skills.<br />- The story is engaging.<br />- For an average player this is still Dragon Age.  The things that defined the game for me are still all in this game.  I think there were elements of DAO that certain types of gamers really liked that were removed from DA2.  For me personally the world, the combat system, and feel of the game are consistent and remind me of what I liked about DAO.<br />- Nice graphics and cut scenes with a cinematic feel.<br />- Dialogue choices are interesting (emoticons and wheel selection don't in any way bother me as they do some reviewers).<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- There are fewer companions (than DA)).  Also, the first few you encounter are quite bland.  Still, this is only a weakness in that the companions aren't as good as DAO.  Judged on their own merit they are still quite engaging.<br />- Very linear level design.<br />- There are better \""loot games\"" available.  Weapon selection is interesting but not amazing (OK, the mage staff with a blade is actually somewhat amazing) and you can't equip armor you find on your companions.<br /><br />Value:<br />At the $19.99 going price I'd say DA is a good solid 3 or 4 star game.  At $5 it is an amazing game that can't be missed.",2012-06-30,325,long,2012-06,games

Thus spawning the title \""freak\"", of which is only fueled by her unique mixed heritage of Korean and white, her plain features and her all around awkwardness.  Grace Shelley's general existence is a lonely one.<br /><br />The range of emotions I experience while reading this book spanned the gamut. My heart broke for Grace and all she endured not just at the hands of the superficial and cruel cretins that were her school peers, but at how she was treated by the one person she had trusted completely and relied on most of her young life only to have it thrown in her face like she was nothing, less than nothing. Wow, my gut bled for her when Graham's rejection was given so callously and seemingly without remorse...[complete B@st@rd].  But I think I was even sicker (if that's possible) at what transpired between them later on... and then was sated when he was taken down a peg by an unlikely foe...and so on... like I said... emotions ran the gamut! And that's the humans; without bringing the beautiful and complicated Angels into the equation, who introduce yet another layer and an emotional rollercoaster all their own.  Needless to say, I was completely captivated by this book.<br /><br />There are a lot of characters to love and hate in FALLING FROM GRACE as well as those that straddle the line. And although the teen paranormal thing has been done seemingly to death over the last 10 years, I felt there was definitely some originality and creativity to the storyline in this first installment of the Grace Series. Yes I was able to spot many of the plot twist ahead of time, but they weren't blatantly obvious, more so cleverly entwined enough in the story that some may not see where they're headed.<br /><br />Being that this is just the first book in a series, I was surprise that while there is an opening at the end for the story for it to continue on, there was not a huge cliffhanger; so FALLING FROM GRACE could easily hold its own as a standalone novel if one decided not to continue on with the series. But for me, I'm intrigued by the lack of questions left unanswered and look forward to see just where Mrs.Naeole will take the story in the next three installments and hope she is able to keep it exciting and fresh to the end.<br /><br />**Oh and BTW, contrary to statements by some reviewers; I saw no correlation between Twilight's story line and this one aside from the fact that the characters are all in high school and the male lead is an immortal being. Bella and Grace are nothing alike in looks, personality and depth of character, empathy, social status, or general over all stories.f the plot twist ahead of time, but they weren't blatantly obvious, more so cleverly entwined enough in the story that some may not see where they're headed.

Winifred Phillips, who composed the entirety of the video game's music, has been involved with other such lauded titles as God of War, LittleBigPlanet 2, Legend of the Guardians, Spore Hero, and Speed Racer, the first two of which I've played and thoroughly enjoyed. But short of recalling her name from the list of contributors on those works, I wasn't intimately familiar with Phillips or her musical talent before Assassin's Creed III: Liberation. I can now proudly sum it up in one word: wow. The Liberation score seemingly takes influences from both video game and film score titles, wraps them all up into one, and lovingly forms a uniquely strong coherent, cohesive, and unflinchingly excellent work of musical brilliance.<br /><br />\""Liberation Main Theme\"" does an effective job of summing up what one is to hear on the album's twenty-six lengthy tracks, combining tribal drumming, guiding strings, and soaring female vocals to create a distinctly impressive leadoff introduction. Once diving into second track \""Stealth,\"" the many influences of Liberation start to become clear, beginning with Hans Zimmer's meandering string cues, sharply turning a corner upon track three, \""Virtual Pursuit,\"" utilizing a John Powell Bourne series' chase scene foundation given its own identity by what is clearly one of Phillips' strongest suits, her sense and deployment of multi-flavored and layered percussion. This contemporary skill continues to shine as one of the album's aural highlights given varying attention in the structure of next tracks \""The Docks,\"" a soothing and delicate string composition mired with apprehension, but where percussion is used sparingly, and \""Abstergo Ops,\"" an eclectic ethnic and orchestral piece with jarring male/female leads and chorus, where the percussion simply explodes into an intentional cacophony of obvious skill and almost casual presentation. \""Secrets of the Bayou\"" then illustrates a different type of sound, with ethnic drums, wavering synth, and oriental-sounding flutes, reminding of a modern-day Bloodsport track culled from an imaginary Paul Hertzog score. Then, with \""Poverty,\"" the album's first real melancholic track makes an entrance, shoveling heaps of layered synth strings upon the listener, a momentary lapse in the excitement of prior tracks but no less entrancing.<br /><br />\""Aveline's Escape\"" begins the fast pace anew, with wild percussion and jarring moments that could easily fit the framework of a horror film score, coupled with string flourishes and female chants. \""Society Suite In 4 Movements,\"" one of the album's highlights, unexpectedly provides a shelter of Elizabethan Renaissance-style keys, harpsichord, and string work of effortless beauty, with the first and second \""movements\"" being more careful constructions of gentle baroque flavor, followed by the last two which exude a romantic ballroom/dance-style sound. \""Ride to Oblivion\""'s pace then develops into \""Mayan Labyrinth,\"" which is the track most reminding of legacy Assassin's Creed series score work by Jesper Kyd, but whose eeriness wouldn't sound at all out of place on a past Tomb Raider soundtrack. With \""Chasing Freedom\"" and \""The Hunt,\"" film score influences again take shape, referencing the Pirates of the Caribbean works of Hans Zimmer yet with a more fruitful and layered approach, and with \""Bayou Fortress,\"" Phillips again changes direction in the slightest, tagging Basil Pouledoris' work for Conan the Barbarian yet in a suppressed and still impressive manner.<br /><br />It's with fifteenth track \""Safe Harbor\"" that the score seems to begin its conclusion, but that's not to say the emotional roller coaster slows down. Quite the contrary: \""Safe Harbor\"" begins as a beautiful synth and string track yet very quickly becomes ripe with deftly placed piano and flute-led melodic lines, reminiscent of Nobuo Uematsu's work on Lost Odyssey. \""Deliverance\"" continuesthis pattern with female-driven lead vocals and an excision of piano, yet an incorporation of dueling high- and low-octave strings. \""Cathedral Grounds\"" will capture the heart of even the most casual Castlevania fan, with its prominent organ and string arrangements, and in turn \""Animus\"" softly heralds Akira Yamaoka's industrial sounds of Silent Hill weaving between mournful, echoed synth. Soon later, \""In the Service of Humanity\"" paints an epic and legendary vibe over its male and female choral-laden foundations, and then \""Virtual Reality Room\"" boldly closes out the album with a mysterious and beautiful denouement that sheds the heart-pounding pace of previous tracks for the sake of overwhelming escapism and slack-jawed awe.<br /><br />I'm unable to tell if Winifred Phillips intended all the aforementioned influences to be noticed on Liberation, but regardless, for an album that seemingly wears so many on its sleeve, the score does the unexpected in bettering, and most cases conquering those sounds. With Assassin's Creed III: Liberation, Winifred Philips has created a staggeringly impressive work of white-hot excitement and effortless quality and beauty, breathing new life into the music for the Assassin's Creed series and musical scoring in general for both video games and films.

They've already released two great albums filled with modern pop music, so their first American EP is basically a Greatest Hits up to this point (with a couple of non-hits tacked on). Because of this, it's already got a leg up on most albums. After all, the Wanted are a strong singles group.<br /><br />1. Glad You Came - The lead single from their second UK album, and the one that broke them in America. It's an addictive slice of tropical euro-pop and definitely Summer appropriate. Not their best, but close. 10/10<br /><br />2. Chasing The Sun - Pretty much, \""Glad You Came\"" part two, but I actually think I like this one better. One of the two \""new\"" tracks on the album, this definitely deserves its single status. It's just ridiculously catchy. 10/10<br /><br />3. All Time Low - Their breakthrough single, and still their best. Basically, what Coldplay's \""Viva La Vida\"" was for alternative music, this is for pop (though I'm aware that describing Coldplay as \""alternative\"" is pretty ridiculous, but you get the point). If there's any justice, this should be a US single. It's too good to go unknown. 10/10<br /><br />4. Satellite - One of the \""new\"" tracks on the album, this Ryan Tedder written track feels a little generic. I don't know... the melody just doesn't do anything all that interesting. Though it's nice to have a new track, I'd rather they would have included the excellent \""I'll Be Your Strength\"" from the second UK album. 8/10<br /><br />5. Lightning - Not my favorite single, but certainly not bad. I loved the melody the first few times I heard it, but it wore thin pretty quickly. I think they could've done something more interesting with the production. Still, overall the pros definitely outweigh the cons. 9/10<br /><br />6. Heart Vacancy - I never understood why this was their second single after the brilliant \""All Time Low.\"" It's just such a basic boyband ballad. I've grown to like it much more than I used to, but it doesn't exactly stand out. 8/10<br /><br />7. Gold Forever - The first time they really experimented with a dancier sound (paving way for \""Glad You Came\"") and it's an utter triumph. The lyrics are a bit naff, but the band has always had pretty horrible lyrics. The song itself is magic. 10/10<br /><br />8. Lose My Mind - The third single from their debut, and definitely one of their most underrated singles. It sounds a bit like what Kings Of Leon would sound like if they went pure pop. Excellent. 10/10<br /><br />9. Warzone - A slower, dubstep influenced track from the second UK album. I don't remember this doing much on the charts. They definitely have better ballads, not that this is horrible or anything. 8/10<br /><br />10. Rocket - I find it weird that, of all the non-singles they could've added to this last slot on the album, they chose this one. Maybe it's because some of the vocals sound mysteriously Backstreet Boys-esque? I love the production on this, but I would hardly consider it an album-standout. They've got a few 10/10 tracks they could have picked. Still, this gets a 9/10<br /><br />Album Grade: 9.2/10",2012-04-24,566,extra_long,2012-04,music

The Hawkins are not really siblings, they found each other and called themself brothers since all three of them were shapeshifter demons, even if of different breed. And in fact Caleb is the less \""devilish\"" of all of them, and when he is in demon form he is not as much different, only his features change. Due to his nature Caleb needs to hunt living prey, usually wild animals, and his sexual urges are very strong. Usually he has no problem to find a willing woman to satisfy them, but one night a unexpected event prevent him to finalize his hunt; Jake, one of the dearest friend of his sister-in-law Risa, is in trouble: six years before he lost his beloved wife and he is still grieving; in this night all he wants i to reach his wife... Caleb can't let him alone, and he spends the night with him, looking after the sleeping man. This cemented a friendship between the two men and the morning after Caleb offers a job as foreman to Jake. Having the man around on the ranch serves only to Caleb to take more and more notice of him, not like a friend but as something more. The problem is that nor Caleb or Jake has never imagined possible to desire another man, and they are moving on a shifting territory. Plus Jake is still mourning his lost wife.<br /><br />The story is very very long, almost 350 pages, and has a lot of sex scenes among with an interesting plot, with some unexpected turns. It's true that there is a lot of sex, but it's not the only reason of the story, the sex is well balanced in the story.<br /><br />Caleb and Jake's relationship is very intense, and both men approach it at the same way: they are not gay, they are not realizing something of them that it was always there ready to be unveiled, they only happen to fall in love with another human being, and the fact that the other is a man is only a details. Moving in an unknowing territory, it's only natural that at first they are not at all comfortable with the idea, but I like their approach. I like also Caleb's way to deal with the memory of Jake's lost wife, even if maybe, he reacts in that way since he doesn't judge himself worthy of the full love of Jake: if Jake retains something of him in their relationship, Caleb is feeling a little less guilty for him, a demon with a dark past, to love a good man like Jake.<br /><br />I also felt a bit sad for Gabriel (I don't want to say more to not give up the story); I'd be glad if Cameron Dane would take in consideration the idea of writing also his story.ble with the idea, but I like their approach.

Liberty Frye and the Witches of Hessen by J.L. McCreedy is a well plotted, fun, adventurous read. The novel follows a classic fairy tale structure, but is written in a modern style so modern readers will enjoy reading it. The story is full of well developed, colorful characters and moves at a fast pace that will keep you entertained. Young Children will love to read, or have their parents read this story to them. A big plus is this story isn't dumbed down for kids. Adults will enjoy it as much as young readers.<br /><br />The story starts when a strange envelope is delivered to Libby's home. Libby's mom reads what's in the envelope and decides she must return to Germany, her home land, and see her parents whom she hasn't seen since before Libby was born. Libby is unaware she had grandparents and is upset that her parents keep so many secrets. Once Libby and her parents reach Germany, the adventure begins.<br /><br />This story is well written and well edited. The kindle formatting is perfect and it is obvious a lot of love was put into setting this eBook up professionally. Some small issues I might not have done, and this is being picky, is the misspelling of words to simulate a German accent. When I first encountered it, I thought it was missed typos. Later, Libby explains that sometimes her mom pronounces w's as v's. I'd rather have seen the words spelled correctly and the structure of the sentence rearranged to simulate a German accent. The biggest reason why is because when you use text to speech on a kindle, the kindle doesn't know how to handle the misspellings and it makes it hard to understand those sections. Not a huge problem, but something to consider.<br /><br />A parent warning, there is one adult word in the novel, p**s, which I was surprised to come across. Not a big deal to me, but some parents who monitor what their children read may want to be aware of it.<br /><br />There is some passive writing in the story as well. Not a lot that it is distracting from the story, but enough to possibly cause an editor to reject it. The words: very, just, seemed, there was, even, etc. were used frequently enough for someone who is a writer to notice. These are considered passive words that should be avoided if possible. A child or a non-writing adult wouldn't notice at all. Just pointing it out as something to be aware of for the next JL McCreedy novel, and I do hope there are many more.

I didn't even know the dude rapped!  Yes he's an actor, but I dare say he is in the upper echelon of rappers out today.  To be a good rapper I believe you need to have a few things.  First off, you need to be clever and have a good sense of humor, and not take yourself too seriously.  You also need to have flow and an appealing, distinctive, pleasing voice.  Beats obviously.  To say this album has all three is an understatement.  This is one of those albums that you need to listen to three or four times before you fully appreciate it.  Similar to a Tarantino movie, every time you watch it you notice something new that is just brilliant.  I also appreciate the guy's honesty.  Some rappers are so scared to be seen as less than 100% cocky and confident, that they can't allow themselves to be honest and admit to their issues.  I believe this is the era of elite lyricists.

There are only a few instances, however, of the exact same plot being reused, almost scene for scene and word for word, under a different episode name. One was \""Shadow of Suspicion\"" (1946) which was repeated, with some minor changes, as \""Stake Out\"" (1948). The other is \""A Pass To Death\"", which was a needless 1944 remake of a very good 1938 episode called \""Guest of Death.\""<br /><br />\""A Pass To Death\"" opens with a man being executed in the electric chair as a he begs for mercy. Cut to Lamont and Margo chatting with a young friend of theirs, an aspiring journalist from down South named Peter Wentworth, who wishes to take a tour of the state prison. Lamont arranges it, and is horrified when Peter turns up dead without a mark on his body. Though the medical examiner can find nothing wrong, the last man to see Peter alive is a 50 year veteran of the prison named Ardice, who has fond memories of his brief turn as the state's executioner, a post that was taken away from him against his will. Lamont suspects Ardice may have been behind Peter's death, but it's up to The Shadow to see whether the old man is conducting executions just for old time's sake...<br /><br />Although I don't think it was necessary to remake a fine episode like \""Guest of Death\"" at all, the reason I gave this two stars is because of its terrible sound quality. There is a metallic warbling to all the dialogue that makes much of it hard to understand and all of it rather unpleasant on the ears. Why this episode was chosen for sale when \""Guest of Death\"" is available, and of excellent sound quality, baffles me.

But Season 2 Outlook Dubious,"Just watched on PBS.org, and Episode 1 of Season 2 (@ nearly 2 hours long) is indeed entirely watchable--but sadly not as delicious as Season 1, which was an unmitigated pleasure. Regrettably, the creators appear to have decided that having captured a mammoth international audience, it is now their duty to preach to them about the horrors of war and the crippling inequities of a class-bound society. This is most unfortunate because, I don't know about you, but for myself, I am already far more familiar than I care to be with both life's unfairness and its more unpleasant aspects, thanks much, and not yearning at all for additional edification in this gloomy area. Again, just my POV, but that is certainly NOT what delights me about watching Masterpiece, and it would be most unfortunate for the team who make Downton to have taken this smugly self-righteous turn. The human interactions were as fascinating in Season 1 as the costumes and locations fun to ogle. In this viewer's opinion, that's the point of watching:  it makes for a welcome respite from the ugliness of the world and it's inhabitants. Admittedly, one episode is not enough evidence to make a judgment, but the course of the new season does appear to be writ large--already there are leaden servings of the shell shock we now call PTSD, depression, alienation, self-mutilation, suicide and the rest of war's ugly effects on civil society--and I can't say the outlook promises to be nearly so enjoyable as last season. Let's hope I'm wrong, but it does appear success has gone to the show's head, and not in a good way.<br /><br />Additionally, Brideshead Revisited, undeniably the absolute pinnacle of British Television and arguably one of the half dozen most brilliant series in the entire history of the medium, kept coming to mind awkwardly often, and the similarities are clearly no accident.  In some ways, the entire Downton oeuvre is one extended homage to the 1981 Granada TV epic.  That's o.k.  Anything that good is worth trying twice. (Ouch!

Nonetheless, despite imitation as sincere flattery, it's beginning to look a tad bumptious to so blatantly ape the Great-House-in-War-Time routine, not to mention Mary's impending nuptials to the craven newspaper magnate, while all the while deeply in love with a social inferior intimately connected to the family, paralleling Julia Flyte's marriage to Rex Mottram, the crass Canadian social climber, so closely it might be said to resemble plagiarism more than flattery.<br /><br />Then again, Brideshead happened over forty years ago, and likely most of Downton's audience has never heard of it.

The new patch seems to have cleared up many of the bugs that others have mentioned.  I have had a handful of minor graphical glitches, but the game-breaking bugs at launch now seem absent.<br /><br />That said, the game itself has its ups and its downs.  The game plays like the previous titles, and I enjoy trying to effectively place my buildings, and squeeze out every last resource that I can.  However, it doesn't do anything new or exciting, aside from provide graphical boxes to aid the player in building placement.  Nor are there any new, exciting buildings.  The battles are still simple, which is fine with me, as this is primarily a city-builder.  It does what it should, albeit with lackluster gusto.<br /><br />Graphically, this falls behind the rest of the city-builders.  Even on ultra-high, ground textures are weak and unrefined.  Buildings are just a few notches above Stronghold 2.  And while many games of the genre utilize neat little animations for city-workers' activities, Stronghold 3's peasants just seem to aimless meander and stand around.  There aren't even cutscenes, rather pen and pencil drawings to illustrate the story.  Really, the only graphical satisfaction is your own, as you marvel at your own building prowess and organization.<br /><br />I'm no audiophile, but the sound functions.  The gameplay doesn't call for any exciting music, so medieval music suffices, although it becomes repetitive (as there is only so much lute the modern man can hear over and over).  The voice acting isn't top notch, but nor is it bad.  For lack of better description, it feels alright for the game.  Otherwise, swords clang, wolves snarl, and military guys \""oof\"" and \""ouch.\""  Really though, you're probably better off with a CD playing in the background and keeping the sound effects to low volume.<br /><br />The real problem, however, is that the game consists of a lot of trial and error.

Bread making, introduced very early, has wheat go to the stockpile, not the granary.  Further confusing steps are required before the player ends up with bread in the granary.<br /><br />While the lack of explanation does not break the game, it makes it very frustrating early in the game.

One touch and she could accidentally infect someone with a deadly plague that could very well kill them. Raised by only her alcoholic father Jenny if forced to to keep her distance from everyone for fear of killing them. She is isolated completely in life, and what little human interaction she does have is done with the protection of long sleeves and gloves at all times. She is an outsider, forever an outcast in her small little town and the target of constant cruelty from the popular crowd who hates Jenny for being different. Jenny's only freedom is on her daily runs through the forest behind her home with her 3 legged dog.<br />But what Jenny doesn't know is that there are others in her town that are like her. They can also wield power through their touch. Power that they don't have to hide behind gloves and long sleeves while avoiding human contact unless absolutely necessary. Once of which even uses their power for their own personal gain, and will use it against Jenny if every given the chance.<br />Through a series of unexpected events, these characters are thrown together in a battle of wits, a battle of powers and a battle for love.<br />I was completely drawn into the book. The author so vividly described the events so realistically that I felt like I was there. I could not get the characters out of my mind and when I wasn't reading I was anxiously awaiting the chance to get back to the book.  Jenny isn't you normal good girl. She holds a deadly power, but is a good soul....that is until she is pushed too far (but I will say nothing more, because I don't want to give anything away). I liked her from the very beginning and was sypathetic to her plight. She had been cursed in her life, and forced to sacrifice everything to save the others around her. At least until she finds the \""antidote\"" to her deadly infection in someone who holds the power exactly opposite of hers, and the one person in her entire life that she is actually able to touch. And it is a touch that she refuses to let go of without a fight.<br />When you first really get to know Jenny, she appears as a pushover, or a weakling bound to live out the rest of her life being pushed around and doomed to live in self pity.

She relishes each glimpse of his shirtless abs, and is dying to see more. But it's hard to connect with a man who doesn't seem to know she exists...<br /><br />Ivan feels at home in the lab, not in social situations. When he finally approaches his attractive neighbor, it's not for a date--he wants tutoring in how to behave at an important fundraiser. Ivan doesn't expect the chemistry between them to be quite so explosive, and is surprised when Cami actually accepts his proposal to embark on a series of \""lessons\"".<br /><br />Cami soon discovers Ivan's schedule isn't the only thing he likes to be strict about--he needs to be charge in the bedroom as well. She's shocked at how much she comes to enjoy her submissive side, but wonders if a real relationship is in the equation...<br /><br />  My Thoughts<br /><br />Whoever said nerds/geeks are not sexy never met Dr. Ivan Reynolds, socially clueless he may be but a cutie nonetheless!<br /><br />Camilla is a very \""rare breed\"" in the apartment complex where she lives, she is one of only two women in the middle of a group of guys. What makes her truly special though is she is popular because of her ability to accept these particular males as they are, after all every one of them is a \""nerd\"" or a \""brain\"" or a \""geek\"" depending on what you choose to define someone whose intelligence IQ is probably close to or beyond the genius level but their social IQ is almost below zero.<br /><br />Dr. Ivan Reynolds, her next door rocket scientist neighbor is a case in point. Ivan has some major difference that sets him apart from the other guys, he is cute, has a nice physique and the \""idiot\"" has no clue Cami exists as an available attractive member of the opposite sex!<br /><br />I loved this books beginning, the way that Cami basically is \""stalking\"" her neighbor by being so aware of his schedule that she even knows it is time to get ready for work when he goes off for his morning jog on weekdays! Plus living in a complex with people who are about as brilliant as they are clueless has to be quite an experience all on it's own.<br /><br />The relationship between Cami and Ivan is very much something that was fun to watch as it took the turn from \""neighbors\"" to friends to \""friends with benefits\"". The understanding that Cami shows for all the OCD behavior that Ivan exhibits is nothing short of wonderful, her patience in looking beyond his brusque attitude to see that the man inside is so focused that he cannot understand why people just do not say exactly what they mean and point out exactly what they want warmed my heart and showed that she really \""got\"" Ivan for who he is and did not try to change him into who she wanted him to be. (At least not too much anyway, smoothing his \""rough edges\"" with some tactful tips was needed for the poor guy to learn to function in public situations better.)<br /><br />The side of Ivan that Cami learns about almost by accident, the dominant articulate male that he becomes behind closed bedroom doors not only surprises her but it excites her beyond measure as well. This is a small taste for Cami of a lifestyle that she has not even associated with her rather uptight neighbor, BDSM is not something that she would have dreamed that he was aware of much less something Ivan actually regularly participated in. After spending more time with him and talking more about what his limits are in social situations it becomes clear to Cami that his sexual preferences are actually quite in keeping with his character as it is all about being in charge, being in control but at the same time relinquishing that control by trusting in his partner. An eye opening revelation for both Cami as well as the reader.<br /><br />I had a good time reading this novella, the characters were fun to interact with, the plot was not hard to follow andthe steamy sexual encounters made a hot summer day even hotter! All in all a quick, easy read that pretty much anyone who enjoys erotic short stories will find interesting and entertaining.<br /><br />The story is very short, it however encompasses all the elements of a longer tale without any problems for me.<br /><br />  [EArc from Netgalley in exchange for honest review]the steamy sexual encounters made a hot summer day even hotter!

If you transfer $2,000 from your checking account to your checking account(note the sequence), your total net worth will increase by $2,000. Perhaps there is a strange accounting rule which allows this, but I cannot understand why this should happen. Either the software should do an automatic check to make sure transfer has to happen between two different accounts, or the software should take $2,000 out of the checking, and in one nano-second put the $2,000 back to the checking. For personal finance, there are only three types of transactions: income, which money flows into the account; expense, which money goes out; or transfer, which money moves around. I don't quite understand the logic of allowing this type of \""transfer\"" to occur. To me this is equivalent to putting your hand into a cookie twice and actually \""creating\"" more cookies! You may think this is not a big deal. But when you reconcile the online transactions, the \""renaming\"" mechanism can sometimes make this happen. If you have one item in checking named \""John Doe\"", \""From savings\"", and the same item will be named \""John Doe\"", \""To checking\"" in your savings. So now you have a renaming rule which can be mapped to \""John Doe\"", either \""To checking\"", or \""From Saving\"". Next time when \""John Doe\"" renaming rule applies, which one should you choose? (Another question is why I have to choose, why cannot the software to be smart to figure this out?) This \""feature\"" existed in version 2009, it's also in 2012. Why? I don't know. Perhaps the accountants at Intuit can give us an answer.<br /><br />For the rest:<br /><br />Like:<br />1. Nicer user interface (compared to older versions). But I am really trying to find a justification for spending the money on this software<br />2. Can't find anything positive to say about this software<br /><br />Dislike:<br /><br />1. Price. Why should I spend money on this software.

I used to use Ms Money, then switched to Quicken. Both are poorly designed and over-priced. The situation only gets worse after Microsoft discontinued Money.

After reading this biography by her friend Sarah Bradford, I'd say she gives God all the credit. Her Christian faith is very prominent and unashamed, which is a shock to this reader 150 years later, but much appreciated. Bradford wrote the book to raise funds for Harriet's ministry in her old age, providing a rest home for aged former slaves. Regarding Tubman's faith, Bradford writes,<br /><br />Harriet's religious character I have not yet touched upon. Brought up by parents possessed of strong faith in God, she had never known the time, I imagine, when she did not trust Him, and cling to Him, with an all-abiding confidence. She seemed ever to feel the Divine Presence near, and she talked with God \""as a man talketh with his friend.\"" Hers was not the religion of a morning and evening prayer at stated times, but when she felt a need, she simply told God of it, and trusted Him to set the matter right. p. 14<br /><br />Tubman's faith is real and gritty. She doesn't stop at letting us know that not only did she pray for her owner's conversion but also for his death, so that his wickedness against here and her family would end. God responded to the latter prayer!<br /><br />...all I could say was, 'Oh, Lord, convert ole master.' Den I heard dat as soon as I was able to move I was to be sent with my brudders, in the chain-gang to de far South. Then I changed my prayer, and I said, 'Lord, if you ain't never going to change dat man's heart, -kill him-, Lord, and take him out of de way, so he won't do no more mischief.' Next ting I heard ole master was dead; and he died just as he had lived, a wicked, bad man. p.14<br /><br />The genocidal cancer of slavery was malignant and could not be confined to slave states, which resulted in the federal law, the Fugitive Slave Act which allowed slave catchers to head into free states to reclaim escaped human beings. Tubman had to conduct her escapees a couple hundred miles farther north into Canada to assure their freedom.<br /><br />...she brought her people to what was then their land of Canaan; the State of New York. But alas! this State did not continue to be their refuge. For in 1850, I think, the Fugitive Slave Law was put in force, which bound the people north of Mason and Dixon's line, to return to bondage any fugitive found in their territories. \""After that,\"" said Harriet, \""I wouldn't trust Uncle Sam wid my people no longer, but I brought 'em all clar off to Canada.\"" p.22<br /><br />Life in southern slave states was not the libertarian ideal some people I know claim it to be. The examples are abundant, but I keep finding new ones. One man was condemned to prison for possessing the most popular work of fiction in those times.<br /><br />They met at the house of Sam Green, the man who was afterwards sent to prison for ten years for having a copy of \""Uncle Tom's Cabin\"" in his house. p. 23<br /><br />Slaves had no right to privacy, so their letters were previewed by whites to protect their \""property\"".<br /><br />Jacob was not allowed to have his letters in those days, until the self-elected inspectors of correspondence had had the perusal of them, and consulted over their secret meaning. These wise-acres therefore assembled, wiped their glasses carefully, put them on, and proceeded to examine this suspicious document. What it meant they could not imagine. p. 34<br /><br />This mindset of slaves as property and not as fellow humans led to ridiculous assumptions about their fellow creatures, such as they did not care about the separation of their families.<br /><br />I have often heard it said by Southern people that \""ni**ers had no feeling; they did not care when their children were taken from them.\"" I have seen enough of them to know that their love for their offspring is quite equal to that of the \""superior race,\"" and it is enough to hear the taleof Harriet's endurance and self-sacrifice to rescue her brothers and sisters, to convince one that a heart, truer and more loving than that of many a white woman, dwelt in her bosom. p. 37<br /><br />Everyone Tubman liberated remained liberated and were never recaptured.<br /><br />... of the three hundred and more fugitives whom Harriet piloted from slavery, not one was ever recaptured, though all the cunning and skill of white men, backed by offered rewards of large sums of money, were brought into requisition for their recovery. p. 25<br /><br />Harriet Tubman later volunteered for the federal forces in the American Civil War as a nurse, a liaison to slaves bewildered by the invading forces, and as a spy. This 2nd hand account Bradford records while trying to retain the flavor of the local dialect...Den I heard 'twas de Yankee ship firin' out de big eggs, an dey had come to set us free. Den I praise de Lord.

And while built on archetypes, the characters are generally well fleshed out and their dialogue feels real enough when you read it that you are not continually dumped out of the novel by way of inconsistencies or silly annoyances.<br /><br />Now sure, there are stereotypes and clich&eacute;s, but this is foremost an adventure novel, and a Boy's Own Adventure novel at that.  Whates does not push the envelope of any particular high tech concept here - be that military hardware, star ship design, AI melding, aliens or even the Human condition - and nor do the characters get bogged down in introspection to the point that you are skipping pages to get back to the story.<br /><br />Instead, he sets up some familiar scenarios and then weaves the interaction of the various characters and those high tech concepts into each plot thread until they all converge toward the end.  I liked Leyton, his jaded black-ops soldier with the very intelligent, very versatile gun.  And trying-to-outdo-my-father industrialist Philip Kaufman is equally pleasing, esp. because he had the makings of a 'step back' kind of anti-hero and I can never sympathise or empathise with those types.  Now perhaps Kaufman seemed a bit simplistic for a guy who heads a multi-billion (trillion? squillion? A HUGE amount in any event) conglomerate.  But that did not detract from my enjoyment of his being one of the main protagonists, it was just a background thought and as I can't count any multi-billionaires as friends I gave him the benefit of the doubt.  Leyton was even more fun as a character, being that quintessential 'Man with No Name' who comes out all guns blazing to save the day and then leaves others to ask questions of the dead bodies.<br /><br />So, keeping in mind that this is an action novel, I think that if you like high-tech, military, conspiracy sci-fi, you'll likely enjoy 'The Noise Within'.  It is certainly better than most first novels, and while Stephen Baxter's \""24 meets Starship Troopers. If you read Reynolds, Hamilton, Banks - read this\"" recommendation is a tad hyperbolic, 'The Noise Within' is certainly is no worse than Hamilton's [[ASIN:0316021830 Fallen Dragon]] and definitely does not impose page upon page of descriptive prose the way Banks tends to do when he's in full flight!

It addresses the etiology of contagious diseases, how they begin, how they are introduced in to the world population, how they can be viewed as instances of germ warfare, how they are examined by both the US Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization, how they are disseminated, the processes required for creating a vaccine, how the treatments are managed, how individuals are affected both directly and indirectly, who decides the priorities of treating large number of people around the globe, and how in the face of a world crisis certain evil people can take advantage of the fear and make millions off unsuspecting terrified people. Yes, this information is in articles readily available for public consumption, but nothing surpasses a well-written film for getting the message across in a memorable way. Writer Scott Z. Burns produced the script and Steven Soderbergh mold this story with great skill. The cast is filled with major actors but in a film of this size few of them are given much screen time.<br /><br />Interestingly the film begins with the marker 'Day 2' and the significance of that move is held until the film's satisfying end. Beth Emhoff (Gweneth Paltrow) is returning home form a business trip in Hong Kong, has a layover in Chicago where she calls her husband Mitch (Matt Damon) informing him of the delay. She arrives home ill and son is dead form a seizure disorder brought on by encephalitis - and infection of unknown type that has spread to her brain. Soon after her death her son dies leaving Mitch terrified by the unknown disease. The US Center for Disease control is headed by Dr. Cheever (Lawrence Fishbine) who engages Dr Mears (Kate Winslet) and Dr. Hextall (Jennifer Ehle) and Dr. Sussman (Elliott Gould) to investigate the disease. The World Heath Organization represented by Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) becomes involved as the point of origin of the disease seems to be Hong Kong: her attempt to help the Chinese is at first assisted by young Sun Feng (Chin Han) until the Chinese forces decide to hold her hostage until the vaccine can be sent to save a province in China. As the contagious disease is studied, identified, and a vaccine becomes available some smarmy people such as 'journalist' Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) goes on the internet blogging the use of forsythia as the cure, bilking millions of dollars around the world for his fake cure. The story is both catastrophic and immediate as Soderbergh intentionally develops personal stories to demonstrate how a severe contagious disease can impact both throngs of peoples and individuals as well.<br /><br />The supporting cast is filled with fine actors and the momentum of the story is almost intolerable fast.

US,13955236,R3JYSGNA51VMJK,B004774ISM,25399286,Mafia II,Digital_Video_Games,4,0,0,False,False,Great game with a few annoying flaws,"Mafia II is a good example of a linear game that allows for open world exploration. Unlike Grand Theft Auto, Mafia does not allow you to choose certain missions to do. All the missions are done right after each other, with no \""down time\"" except for the travel time between missions. This means that you can never explore the game world while not \""in a mission\"", even if your objective is just to travel to a new destination. This makes the game much faster, but also allows for more hardcore gamers to explore and find collectibles (playboy magazines and wanted posters) and just cause some chaos. The guns feel great, and the cover system works very well. Friendly and enemy AI are both intelligent. Enemies will try to flank you, and friendlies will watch your back.<br /><br />Now for the few annoying flaws.<br />1. You do a lot of driving. A LOT of driving. There isn't one instance in the game where you have a group of people in a car but you aren't driving. This can get very annoying, especially during long play sessions. You will be driving to a point on one side of the map to drop someone off, and then have to drive all the way back to go to sleep or complete another objective.<br />2. The police are too alert. They come after you for small things (hit and run) and large things (murder). But their response can vary so much. For example, you can murder a civilian in front of a cop, and sometimes them not notice. But if you hit another car down the street from a cop, they are on your ass in a second. This would all be okay if shaking the cops were easy, but in Mafia, it's not. First you have to get out of the \""alert\"". This involves driving around to lose your pursuers. Then, while avoiding any other cops, you have to either change your license plate, color of your car, or get a new car. If the cops are after YOU, rather the car, you have to change your clothes. This gets quite annoying. You can bribe the cops by using a payphone, but they are hard to get to without beingdetected.<br /><br />All in all, Mafia II is an exceptional game with a great storyline and great voice acting. The few flaws are easily overlooked by the incredibly gameplay mechanics and characters.",2012-07-19,407,long,2012-07,games

I was excited to discover this book and bought it for my kindle. I was terribly disappointed. The writing was terrible. It was very choppy, and there were tons of grammatical errors and misspellings. There is also a lot of questionable information about Lucy and Desi themselves. At one point, he refers to Lucy on the day she died as the girl born Lucille Esmeralda McGillicuddy - this is not Lucy's real name, it is the maiden name of her character in I Love Lucy. She was born Lucille Desiree Ball.<br /><br />The one plus side to this is that there are quite a few pictures included in the book. The downside to this is that the formatting for the kindle is not quite right. A picture will appear on one page with a description at the bottom, but 9 times out of 10, the description is continued onto the next page.

Mr. SOS left the group, and Kno began focusing almost solely on the production, bringing in Kentucky veteran Natti to trade rhymes with Co-Founder Deacon the Villian. The changes were immediate. With Natti & Deacon trading rhymes about Race relations, Politics, and the occasional ode to simple pleasures like Sex and gettin High, coupled with Kno's drastically improved production, infusing samples of Psychadelic Rock, Classic Soul & a lil bit of Jazz, they truly proved to be the air to the Soulful Southern Sounds of Outkast, Goodie Mob & Organized Noize.<br /><br />The album is a loosely tied together concept record circling around various aspects of Faith & Religion, but the songs are also perfectly capable of standing out from the package and are enjoyable simply as songs, something alot of conecpt albums arent capable of doing. The Guest spots are all carefully chosen and arranged with masterful sequencing. Immortal Technique makes an excellent appearence on \""Never Know Why\"" adding his unique and oft-times controversial political opinions, Tonedeff appears as a recently deceased Racist at the Gates of heaven, weighing his good & bad deeds out for Saint Peter and even Cee-Lo Green Himself comes thru for the hook on \""Caved In\""<br /><br />This was the album that really made them one of my favorites groups.

US,47470005,R1CFUYH4WQ286H,B007C89B44,78829106,Norton 360 6.0 - 1 User/3PC,Digital_Software,1,6,12,False,False,Find a Better Solution,"I've learned not to fear a potential virus; I fear Norton.  I have learned the hard way that we cannot believe everything we hear.  In this case: Buy an anti-viral program to protect yourself against a virus or malware attack.  After what I've been through, I now suspect that the people who manufacture the anti-viral programs are the ones who produce the viruses.  It's the cyber version of the Al Capone protection racket: Pay me and I won't break your legs.<br /><br />It's my fault, I didn't learn from past experiences with Norton. Many years ago, I installed a Norton Utilities program in one of my computers and later spent hours correcting the modifications they had made.  Fast forward to around 2001 when I bought their Internet Security and everything seemed to be okay, so I eventually upgraded to the 360 version.<br /><br />With the 360, everything you do will eventually slow to a snail's pace, if that.  While I tried to type e-mails, my cursor would disappear or the computer keys would not respond if I tried to type.  Reason? Norton was apparently busy downloading garbage onto the computer.  Tap, tap, tap my fingers while Norton was busy in the background and I was getting nowhere.  Then came the constant messages: Internet Explorer is using too much memory (of my limited 512MB RAM - yes, one of my computers is somewhat outdated).  Sometimes when I checked, the computer was using only 100 or 300 of the Toshiba's 512 MB RAM.<br /><br />Other problems included: desktop icons that took up new residency, unable to cut and paste without the font changing to another style and size, allegedly correcting errors on add-on devices (such as my portable hard drive which I will now have to trash), constant updates, such as one of nine, that wanted to download as I was shutting down for the night, despite the fact that I had configured the system not to do that, but Norton would reconfigure over my settings, and, finally, my computer was sometimes unable to interact with theprinter.  So, I decided to remove Norton from each of my computers.  To make a long story short, the Uninstall process wrecked my second computer, a Vista HP.  I had planned to send it out for repairs, but luckily, I found the Recovery DVD, and waited about four hours while the Recovery DVD did its thing and restored my computer.  The next day, I spent another five hours installing programs and updating the machine.<br /><br />Then there was the incident with my brand new ASUS.  By the time I unwrapped that little baby a few weeks ago, I knew that I was not going to install an anti-viral program.  I transferred all the programs and files from my old Toshiba onto the new ASUS.  I enjoyed working on a new computer with all my old programs, but that was short lived.  I wasn't familiar with Windows 7 and needed to visit ASUS to install their latest keyboard driver, which was allegedly free.  I entered the URL for the driver and hit enter.  I ended up at a Bing Search engine and selected what I thought was an ASUS website because it started with the asus address.  In hindsight, I know that you cannot assume such things.  I proceeded to download a driver manager.  As soon as the download was complete, I was invited to subscribe to Norton for approximately thirty dollars in order to activate the product.  I declined the offer, but when I returned to my desktop, that little download had managed to deactivate all the programs and files that I had transferred a few days earlier.  To eliminate the problem, I had to recover the computer to its original factory state and start from scratch.<br /><br />My brother, friend, and ISP people have given me the following collective advice:  Anti-viral programs don't destroy viruses; they allegedly isolate them.  Whenever you get a new computer, make sure you have recovery DVD's for it, and store all your program Key numbers in a safe place, in case you ever experience what I did.  If you don't know how to do a transfer/migration using Windows, it may also be a good idea to keep a computer transfer/migration program on hand that will allow you to transfer programs from one computer to another.  To protect yourself against potential viruses, activate your operating system's firewall.  Don't visit any suspicious websites, e.g. porn sites and sites that offer \""free\"" stuff.  \""Free\"" can be very expensive.  Periodically delete cookies, temporary files, and internet history from your browser.  You can do that by going to the control panel and finding Internet Options.  Do not open any chain e-mail, e.g. the silly jokes and other mindless nonsense that your friends send you.  I have been very guilty of that because, while I discard the USPS junk mail, I do entertain myself reading nonsense e-mail, which is sometimes funny.  That shall come to an end.  Watch over your young children, and make sure that they don't \""click\"" on anything inappropriate.<br /><br />Norton 360 UPDATE<br />After investing the time to repair my computers, I reflected on the following: Windows has its own security system and updates, and they offer several free services.  So, if you learn how to use what Microsoft already has for free, you may not need any additional security for your system, except a book that can explain all that Microsoft has to offer.  Regrettably, today's software programs can do a lot more than what they did ten years ago, but they don't come with a manual, and if they did, we don't take the time to read them.  Then we end up buying other programs and services that we already own, but we don't know that we have them.  I regret that, prior to encountering the aforementioned problems, I didn't take the time to read a Dummies, Idiots, or any other book that explains how most of my software functions and the support services that it includes.  Case in point, my sister recently asked me to recommend an inexpensive program that she could use for making slides and movies.  \""Yes,\"" I said, \""It's called Windows Movie Maker or AutoMovie.  There's also Microsoft Office PowerPoint.  You already have them on your computer, and they play on Windows Media Player.\""  I then directed her to her local bookstore to find and thumb through a book that she might like and to visit the Microsoft website for more information and ideas.  To make sure that you don't end up at a bogus website, go to START, click PROGRAMS, and find Windows UPDATE.  Click on that or find a legitimate site through BING or GOOGLE.  BING is a search engine, just like Google, but it's Microsoft's search engine.  Once you're in the UPDATE webpage, go to Microsoft HOME or enter what you seek in the Search Bar.<br /><br />So, here are the fix-its that I found at Microsoft.  Microsoft has updates for their products that contain all sorts of things: new fonts, new languages, better ways for a program to work, and security.  They also offer free and paid-for technical support that will probably last longer than the warranty on your computer.  They were supporting Windows 95 up until last year; that's a long time.  In April, 2014, they will stop support for Windows XP.  You can find out when support for Windows Vista and Seven will end by visiting their website.  How did they help me?  After I re-installed all the programs on my Windows Vista computer, the Internet Explorer would not work after I downloaded every conceivable update and upgraded, for free, from Explorer 7 to 8, and finally 9.  Nothing worked.  I installed a FireFox browser with a CD, and went on line that way.  From there, I went to the Microsoft website, found the Contact section, and got them to call me.  The Indian technician talked me through what I needed to do to reset the browser; it worked beautifully, and it didn't cost me a dime, for a computer that's about six years old.  Yes, they offer paid services, but if what the first tech does works for you, you don't have to go the \""Check Out Desk.\""  Security, repair, and update programs are free because Microsoftapparently realizes that if they don't protect their products, they won't keep their consumers.  So, the very first thing that we all should do is buy and study an instruction book.  In areas of the country where people commute to work by train, we should be reading those books as we travel.  You probably won't remember everything when you get home, but you'll at least have a general idea of what your computer and software can do for you.  Secondly, learn to turn on that Windows Firewall; it's free, it usually comes with your computer, and you won't have to be fleeced by anti-viral con artists.  Without Norton 360, my computers boot faster and I can finish my e-mails quicker.  I will probably continue to download the Microsoft Security updates; you can program your computer to do that automatically or you can visit the website and install them yourself.",2012-05-26,1535,extra_long,2012-05,software

I had even less of an idea that this band existed since I stopped listening to alot of this genre halfway through high school. Needless to say, I've been out of touch.<br /><br />I was exposed to FiR last week at the Warped Tour kick off party. I was blown away at the response they received. To be quite honest I didn't get it because Ronnie's voice was pretty terrible and the whole performance felt like a joke. I seriously felt like I was at a filming of an SNL skit. The band seemed like cool people you would want to be friends with, but their music didn't do anything for me. Ronnie was entertaining, but definitely not for the right reasons. I couldn't take them seriously if I tried.<br /><br />But with this much of a following there had to be something I wasn't seeing or hearing. The music had to be pretty great, right?<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />Here are a few things I felt about The Drug In Me Is You:<br /><br />- Ronnie can't sing. I mean he can hold a note, but not a very good one. It sound's more like he's speaking with rhythm.<br /><br />- This album is so lyrically immature that it's difficult to connect to on any level whatsoever. I'm barely an established adult at only 22, but I feel like this whole album was written by a child who doesn't understand anything. That's the worst aspect of this album. I honestly feel like if the lyrics weren't so horrible, Ronnie's voice wouldn't bug me as much.<br /><br />- The album as a whole was put together well. There's a good balance of musical styles incorporated into the songs so it was musically enjoyable to hear from start to finish.<br /><br />- The band is made of good musicians. The songs weren't just glorified scales, they were well put together pieces of great rock music. If this album were instrumental it would be a staple on my iPod.<br /><br />- As horribly written as they are, the songs on this album are pretty damn cathcy. \""I'm Not A Vampire\"" and \""Pick Up The Phone\"" will get stuck in your head for sure.

It's the singularly most absorbing fantasy game I have ever played, and certainly one of the absolute best available for the Mac Platform. The world is incredibly rich--I've played through as about eight different characters, all with unique skills and backgrounds, and I STILL don't think I have seen all there is to see. There's an unbelievable amount of lore and backstory to discover about nearly every character, creature, and location in the game. Each different character you play as allows you to see the world in a new way and use entirely different approaches. Your choice of followers and your interactions with them can dramatically change the storyline in ways that are subtle and unpredictable. The characters are rich and complex--humorous, noble, two-faced, sexy, greedy, fanatically pious, fashion-addicted, the works. This might be a good time to note that this is decidedly an adult game--you can have a \""grown-up\"" relationship (By which I mean sex) with both male and female characters in the game, and the level of splattery gore is at near-horror-flick levels. There are also some fairly mature themes and frightening images as well.   The combat follows the Bioware \""pause--issue orders to your group members--unpause and watch the fireworks\"" mode but you can also play in \""real time\"" for a more visceral experience. Combat and leveling don't offer a super-micro-managed granular level of choices the way a D&D-based game does but there are enough character-building options to allow you to play through dozens of times and never build the same character twice. You can have a mage that specializes in elemental magic, in combat magic, in dark \""blood magic, \""and so on, for example. Plus your choices on whether your character is ruthless, self-serving and ambitious or merciful, generous and noble will affect your skills as well. It's not as mindlessly \""click-and-kill\"" asDiablo 2 and it's not as D&D-math-nerdy as Neverwinter Nights or Baldur's Gate.  The graphics are somewhat dated at this point--they look their age. But once you are in the game you stop caring pretty quickly. While, at its heart, Dragon Age is a conventional fantasy tale with wizards, dragons, elves, a dark peril that threatens the land, etc., there is both a healthy irreverence for these cliches AND a desire to do it right this time that makes the game really fresh and engaging.  With the inclusion of the \""Awakening\"" add-on it's almost as if you're buying two full games--call it 1.75 games. The Awakening storyline expands on the original premise and enhances the gameplay in a way that most game companies would be happy to call a sequel and charge full price for.  Once you add in the additional DLC in the pack it really is an incredible value. And, while I have not personally tried any of them, there are many, many user-created adventures available on-line.  If you are a Mac-only gamer like me sometimes you can feel pretty left out--constantly ignored by the AAA game makers. If you feel this way you can't afford to miss this game--the cost-to-hours-played ratio is nothing less than astonishing.",2012-01-23,535,extra_long,2012-01,games

You'll want to listen to every tune from a historical perspective, but only add half of them to your Jazz-party-shuffle for your friends.<br /><br />The Charlie Parker Wikipedia article mentions three tunes on this recording as a historically important low point in Parker's recording career:<br />\""Prior to this session, Parker drank a quart of whiskey. According to the liner notes of Charlie Parker on Dial Volume 1, Parker missed most of the first two bars of his first chorus on the track, 'Max Making Wax.' When he finally did come in, he swayed wildly and once spun all the way around, away from his microphone. On the next tune, 'Lover Man', producer Ross Russell physically supported Parker. On 'Bebop' (the final track Parker recorded that evening) he begins a solo with a solid first eight bars. On his second eight bars, however, Parker begins to struggle, and a desperate Howard McGhee, the trumpeter on this session, shouts, 'Blow!' at Parker. Charles Mingus considered this version of 'Lover Man' to be among Parker's greatest recordings, despite its flaws.  Nevertheless, Parker hated the recording and never forgave Ross Russell for releasing it. He re-recorded the tune in 1951 for Verve.\""<br /><br />I bought this after enjoying \""All the Things you Are\"" so much (Art Pepper has another great version of this tune: [[ASIN:B002E7ITJG All The Things You Are]]).

The companionship, the turmoil, everything was perfect. The emotions that tore at the soul was exquisite. Season four  is dull. Each show with the exception of the first is awkward with everyone trying to fit into this new little family. That fake doll they've got playing Eve is creepy because it is so obviously fake. I don't care about the new vampire and his OCD ways. Love the werewolf but who doesn't love puppies?  Even Annie is boring. How the heck can she not know that she can send a vampire flying through the air and why doesn't she do it? Episode 5 has no sound and the thing is I don't care cause I'm not missing anything.  I know it's open for another season, but if it doesn't pick up soon, I'm gonna bail and stick to the Scyfy version. Gads! I never thought I would say that.<br /><br />update 1/30/13  Must of been in a bad mood when I wrote the review for I have continued to watch season 4 multiple times. I think I needed to get over the shock of the characters who left the show. It did leave me so sad and it all seemed so futile. But the dead must continue on living and I do love the new ghost and I'm enjoying watching the new wolf grow up. The new vamp... I think he can step up to the plate when needed. Not nearly as hot as Mitchell, but I think he'll grow on me.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the new characters that were introduced in this season - granted they are mostly dead-dead now as well, but it was good writing and good story telling. I'll be happy when season five arrives.  As for the Scyfy version - BBC is still way better. :-)",2012-04-06,308,long,2012-04,videos

(I've played Build-a-Lot on the iPod and then bought #4 in the PC series.)<br /><br />You're building dens and cottages and manors (those are the first 3 unlocked options I made it to) instead of different types of houses, but it's basically the same -- you need a certain amount of materials and workers to build, upgrade or paint your dwellings to increase the amount of rent you make on a regular basis.  There are some cute differences in that some of the property you're given at the start of a level might be a stand of trees which you can cut down for either money or material.  The workers are fairies.  And, instead of your house just suddenly needing repair, occasionally a dragon will show up to start it burning and you need to extinguish the fire (instead of repairing it.)  The area in which you can build is limited, so it's not an open \""sand box\"" in which you can play.  There are goals you must meet before you can go to the next level, such as having 3 painted cottages and 4 fairies, or you must demolish 2 houses and reforest 3 areas, that type of thing. If you need a property that is \""owned\"" by the game, you have to wait until the game decides to put it up for sale and hope that -- at that particular time -- you have the money to purchase it. And each level is timed, so you really can't sit there and just play until you get something that is pleasing to you. There is a \""casual\"" mode that gets unlocked after you successfully complete about 4 levels and it looks like all the options are available for you to play with in that mode, though the area in which you can build is still limited to the same amount as in the timed levels.<br /><br />It downloaded and installed just fine on my Windows 7 netbook.  The graphics are pretty; I keep speakers turned off so I can't speak to anysounds in the game.  You can replay any level you've either successfully completed or unlocked, later levels in the \""storybook\"" or what I call 'timed' mode are locked.  Casual mode, after you've unlocked it, seems to allow access to later levels (presumably more expensive domiciles and other structures I hadn't yet unlocked after 20 minutes of play.)<br /><br />I should probably give it a 4 star rating, but frankly I didn't find it different enough from Build-a-Lot 4 to get it past my \""oh, it's ok\"" feeling so I'll leave it at 3 stars.  Certainly if you like the fairy tale setting or have not played any of the earlier entries I have no qualms about suggesting you start with this one if only because it's specifically rated to run on Windows 7.  (I'm always leery about buying a game that claims to run on only earlier versions of my operating system; sometimes they run and other times they don't.  If you have a fairly new computer, particularly if you have not purchased earlier entries in this series, I really do believe this one is your best bet.  The gameplay seems to be exactly the same as the previous games, just the pictures/descriptions/tokens used have been changed to fit the fairy tale theme.)  I also find the price -- in the $5 - $10 range -- to be reasonable as it took me 20 minutes to make it past the first 4 of 35 levels, with the option of casual play giving you basically unlimited replay value.",2012-06-18,633,extra_long,2012-06,games

I found this item and, despite it costing 3-4 times as much as other popular GRE prep options, I thought I would give it a try. I sincerely regret this. There are an embarrassing number of typos and omissions, which make the already tiresome process of preparing for a standardized test even more frustrating. Among several of the reading comprehension sections, I became frustrated over the number of questions I was getting wrong. Upon reviewing the solutions for these problems, I realized that they were referencing portions of the passage that did not even exist!!! Do yourself a favor, avoid the frustration and confusion, and go with a more reliable test prep option. I picked up a copy of Kaplan's 2011-2012 \""New GRE Premier\"" from my local library and have so far been very pleased the the content - and it was FREE. Even the Kaplan guide has some errors, although not nearly as frequent and egregious as those found in this Barron's \""GRE Course for Windows\"". The only upside to this product from Barron's is the shear number of practice questions with immediate feedback.

I didn't know until yesterday that Amazon even offered this service,pay per view online for current releases when they're available everywhere else,except for Netflix.Don't get me wrong,the Netflix service is a great deal if you have some patience for must see new releases,which I usually have,but not this time!  As for the movie,my expectations were very high or at least very hopeful,and I wasn't disappointed...For the most part...I wish they hadn't rushed things like they did at times.I prefer slower reveals,more suspense,but overall,they did a great job.The other problem throughout the whole movie was a very dark picture making it hard to see anything.This did nothing to add fear or suspense,it was more frustrating.Maybe when watching it on dvd at home the picture will be a little brighter.  This would be a great idea for the next 'Thing' or for a similar movie,there should be some thought provoking dialogue between the alien and the humans.A moment when everyone knows who is what,and there's a pause in the mayhem to find out what is motivating the alien imposter,the why,what and how behind its actions...It would have been very interesting to find out if the alien was just a homicidal maniac or since it's very intelligent there might be a method to the madness,a plan,a vision.  And even bolder idea then would be to let the alien bad guy win to see what that agenda is after reaching full fruition!..If the \""thing\"" took over the world and won complete victory,how would the world change and how would the world be different...As humanoid things how would we be the same and how would we be different.  Such a movie would be extremely entertaining and thought provoking as well!..I suspect that eventually humanoid aliens would become just like we are today,only made out of different stuff,maybe better.  But I don't think movie makers have the guts to make such a movie where the aliens win,and we get to see what develops long term...Most movie makers don't have much original thought...Trust me Hollywood,let the aliens win sometimes,all the way,please.

After all humans are largely just the sum of their/our memories,and this alien creature not only absorbs and assimilates our bodies but also our brains and memories to not only pass for human but as the specific individual it's using as its host...

It was extremely promising and I had fun reading it, but it has a lot of new-author mistakes, in my opinion. There is nothing in there that I think will \""ruin\"" your experience reading the story, but certainly the flaws are enough to knock off a star from the rating. Please don't take from the rating of 3-stars that I don't recommend it:  just know that you're reading the work of someone who's still finding her legs as an author.<br /><br />On the plus side:  There is a lot that I consider \""fresh\"" in the story. Nothing wholly \""new\"" to me, but it's generally presented in a way that makes it almost feel new and exciting. The community they live in seems interesting, with an unsettled balance between the \""Regulars\"" and the \""Kindred\"" and a dark past that begs for more insight. Many of the background characters (Gareth in particular) are given a depth that's endearing. The story itself was fun and a little darker in parts than I expected. The set-up for future stories is there and I very much look forward to them.<br /><br />On the negative side... There's not going to be a whole lot that's going to surprise you if you read a lot of similar material. That's not to say it's not embroidered with its own distinct details, just I can't think of much that caught me off-guard in terms of overall \""plot\"" (situational circumstances, however, did). The characters are mainly stock as well and fairly inconsistent in personality. They're painted in broad strokes and the detail that makes, say, Gareth fascinating makes his sister, Raven, look almost cartoonish in comparison. Likewise, more research into certain villains would have turned them into creatures of nightmare rather than Scooby-Doo bad-guys. The relationship between Ivy and Nick is a little clunky as well. I can't quite decide if it's because Ivy's a little awkward and Nick is a demon, but Nick's personality set off all sorts of warning bells for me due to the way he attempted to begin his courtship. (The way her friends ignored Ivy's wants and tried to push Nick on her alarmed me as well. Nothing about that felt supportive or healthy, though at least the actual courtship got better towards the end and Nick came off less creepy.)<br /><br />The thing that bothers me the most is really that I don't recall demons ever being explained. From the way they were presented in the story, they just seem to be human spellcasters with an affinity for fire and \""intense\"" in relationships. Other types of Kindred were explained at least briefly, but the \""what\"" of one of the major characters in the story wasn't. It was hard for me to know how to take Nick's actions, because I had no baseline to work off of. Are demons typically considered evil? Are they birthed from Hell as a race or are they just a type of human spellcaster that got their name from fictional Hellborn creatures? Do they normally look different from humans and the human face is a glamour? I can understand a certain amount of glossing over for witches/wizards, werewolves, and vampires as the only real need to bring up the story's \""rules\"" for them is when something comes up that conflicts with what everyone \""knows\"" about them, but it seems like the lack of attention to demons was actually problematic and shows what I felt was a reoccurring problem with the writing: omission of the details that would make things more interesting or clarify.<br /><br />I think part of the problem here is that it might have had \""too many hands\"" and people might have been afraid to hurt feelings or step on each others' toes. I feel like chapters or sections may have been moved around and things taken out that actually needed to be there. On the plus side, this meant that there was only one typo that I noticed in the text (a \""you're\"" that should have been a \""your\"") and some scenes were rather marvelously polished. It sort of felt like what was good about the story, everyone was happyto point out and suggest how to make better - but the things that were a little awkward were left alone.<br /><br />Please understand that I'm only writing so much and being critical the way I am because I do think that the author has real talent and I'm very much looking forward to the next story. I wouldn't bother to take the time otherwise.

This book, not so much.","Firstly, let me start by saying that I only subscribe to four blogs, and the blog by these authors (The Minimalists) is one of them. At a time when so many people are being hit with so many things that look like they need to be done, the authors are really good at using minimalist principles to focus on what is important.<br /><br />That's what they do in their blog. That's not what I found in this book. Apart from the occasional sentence mentioning that minimalism helps you focus on the important things, the rest of the book contains:<br /><br />- Details on the authors' story of how they became minimalist and left their jobs. Only a small amount of added information compared to their blog, but I did enjoy that part.<br />- A chapter on the importance of eating unprocessed foods and doing exercise. No information that was new to me.<br />- A chapter on the importance of prioritizing the more important relationships in your life and working to eliminate relationships with negative impact. No real concrete directions other than to create a list of all the people in your life and catalog how close they are to you and whether their impact on your life is positive, negative, or neutral, then prioritize your use of time accordingly. Several pages about things like love and trust being important in relationships.<br />- A chapter on the importance of finding your passion, having a mission in life rather than just doing a job. One really good paragraph about the idea that if you don't know what your passions are then you still have anchors, things that are dragging you down (like stress from debt for example).<br />- Chapters on the importance of growing as a person and contributing, but again no real advice other than to get doing that stuff.<br /><br />The problem I have with all this is that I already know these things, and I would imagine most people do. The biggest gain I have had from reading the authors' blog is how to attack the clutter that gets in the way of me executing on these, and unfortunately this is not what this book was about. The authors do make attempts to talk about how to get the emotional energy to achieve the important things, for example they talk a little bit in this book about how you need to go from an attitude of \""should\"" to an attitude of \""must\"", but that totally leaves unaddressed the fact that the stuff that's cluttering up our time and resources somehow got itself into the \""must\"" category when it shouldn't have, and now what? How to actually wade through it to reverse this take-over? (Again, please note that I think their blog does speak to that).<br /><br />If you have the same problem as me, namely clutter (whether it be stuff, commitments, whatever), and want ways to help untangle yourself from it to actually make space for the \""real stuff\"" you want to do, and already know that real stuff to be important, then I wouldn't read this book.

If you're using 2009 or earlier then yes for the simple reason Intuit no longer issues fixes or support for them. It's always good to keep your software close to the current version. If you're using 2010 or later then you're probably safe for another year or two.<br /><br />The one thing I've seen in many of the reviews here is how awful the GUI is. I'm not sure if these reviewers received a different version of Quickbooks 2013, but if not then they need to make sure their monitors are set right or have their eyes checked. The color scheme is fine, and nothing is difficult to read. This is on a 24\"" monitor set at 1920x1080. The layout is a little different but nothing you can't adapt to fairly quickly. I suspect the backlash is not because things are difficult to read but, rather, the simple fact that Intuit changed something and the negative reviewers don't like change.<br /><br />Quickbooks 2013 isn't a necessary upgrade for anyone using 2010, 2011, or 2012. The only exception to this is if you upgrade to Windows 8 and Intuit decides not to support any product besides 2013 on Windows 8.

For die-hard gamers it is a yes, and for what made Sonic so popular in the first place for new ones, that could be a no.<br /><br />Sonic The Hedgehog 4: Episode 2, for download is actually a step back into the old direction that many gamers have loved about Sonic The Hedgehog 2 and 3 very well from the classic Sega Genesis days. The gameplay handles better as Sonic & Tails team up again to fight against Dr. Robotnik, and his plot to take over the universe, and stop Sonic at all costs. The graphics stand well just like Sonic 4: Episode did, but it has a bit more in the gameplay that is nostalgic, from the levels and bosses, all the way to the special stages for those chaos emeralds. The stages take it up a notch, while paying homage to Sonic 2 in its half-pipe speed stages. But the control handles better in the game, as you try and defeat menacing bosses, including the return of the vulgar Metal Sonic from Sonic CD, and a nasty boss fight with Dr. Robotnik in the Death Egg Zone, where a brawl awaits beyond control.<br /><br />All in all, this is what the first Sonic The Hedgehog 4 should've been made in the first place. Overall, there was much more that gamers have awaited, but should've been made sooner to continue celebrating Sonic's 20th anniversary. But it was made up for Tails celebration instead.

That's true. They'll also tell you that James Nesbitt burns as the real star of the film. Also true. Very true. But the real power of this film is in the three points of view represented, the cautionary tale of blindness due to one's cause, and the incredible representation of 33 years of un-relationship the two main characters have that explodes in the 5 minutes they spend actually physically together.<br /><br />To point 1, the screenplay gives us the obvious lines of Joe and Alistair, but also subtly weaves in the perspective of the Truth and Reconciliation crew, who have their own stories and reactions to what's happened, happening, and what they think needs to happen. All three perspectives, to point 2, are myopic in their focus. Joe wants to exact vengeance, Alistair wants to unburden himself of the lie he believes he is living, and the T&R team are after societal goals that seem bigger than the two men. Each would be successful to their own detriment, despite seeking corrective action for the past.<br /><br />But the biggest of these points is the slow and intense build-up of 33 years of gut-wrenching agony that the two men share having only exchanged a short stare on a dark sidewalk in the midst of horror. Their bond, their un-relationship, is the real story. Most reviewers refer to the climactic scene as the focal point. While it is somewhat cathartic, the story is in the telling of what these men lived with trapped in their own hells of regret, hatred, shame, and grief, inextricably linked to someone they never spoke to. Getting to watch as external forces drew them together, nearly unwillingly, is what kept me riveted. There are masterful moments of direction along the way, and then there is Nesbitt's performance. I am not sure I have seen a more emotionally authentic movie portrayal of grief, rage, and relinquishment. And in the end, it is two short deliveries he makes that are the real climax point of the movie.<br /><br />If you like movies to challenge your mind and heart, all the while making you appreciate the craft, this is one for you.the end, it is two short deliveries he makes that are the real climax point of the movie.<br /><br />If you like movies to challenge your mind and heart, all the while making you appreciate the craft, this is one for you.",2012-05-29,428,long,2012-05,videos

I love a good science fiction novel, especially with biology, and I really enjoyed the premise of the story. However, I had a very difficult time with the author's writing style throughout the entire book. Too many things were written in plain English, there was very little foreshadowing, the themes were not consistent, cause and effect relationships were ignored, and each character seemed to exist in his or her own glass bubble with respect to the feelings of other characters. It almost felt more like a play, as if the dialogue was there, and there were instructions to the \""actors\"" as to what they were supposed to feel, or portray, or do, but the words that were used to string out the story were not doing what they needed to in order to bring the characters to life. Aside from that, the author clearly did not do much research into the world of scientific publication, which might be fine for the lay reader, but as a biology teacher and a lover of sci-fi, I was rather disappointed because of the lack of reality this offered. Part of the enchantment of science fiction is the SCIENCE portion of it... the part that makes it seem as if it could almost come true.<br /><br />I downloaded this book when it was free on Kindle, but if I had paid for it I probably would've returned it.

I've never been one for RTS games.  Of course, I've played enough to know I only like them a bit.  Starcraft 2 never really did it for me.  So I decide to try out Shogun 2 at a friend's, and I'm amazed.  This game is awesome.  Just the way it's played.  The turn-based section involves taking over Kyoto, the Shogun's province, using diplomacy and war to get your way.  There's an unbelievable amount of options to choose from when dealing with other provinces.<br /><br />The RTS though is what's got me.  You control entire units instead of individual men, making it somewhat easier to control, while this also adds another aspect of strategy.  You can establish formations in single units, and the game also gives you formations for the entire army.  You fight on many different terrains, with hills, forests (which can be used to hide units), villages, and plains.  Occasionally you'll get into a siege battle.  Either you defend, where you just keep all of your men in a castle and keep out the attackers, or you attack, where you attempt to breach the castle walls (or you can have your men scale them.  Also, ninjas can sneak in, if you have a unit of them) and take over the castle.  There's a morale system, where men can be discouraged or encouraged according to the amount of men they're facing, how good or terrible they're doing in battle, and the general's rally cries (which you control).  This means you don't have to eradicate every single one of the opponent's men on the battlefield, because if you use the right tactics you can scare them away.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great blend of Turn-based strategy and Real time strategy.  I would recommend this to anyone, unless you have a real big problem with any type of strategy game.",2012-01-03,314,long,2012-01,games

It was very emotionally provocative and real for me. This is a really good motivator to keep me moving forward on improving my lifestyle.<br /><br />Specifically, I applaud the manner in which the film covered the following aspects:<br /><br />1) Not glossing over the fact that it is hard, that there are physiological challenges to get through, and also temptations associated with food lifestyle change that you have to resist. One can enter into a different environment for a little while to get a routine established, but eventually you have to 'go back to the real world' and face down your personal triggers, whatever they may be. And that just because it's hard, doesn't mean that there aren't ways to get through it, and how important having a strong motivation for getting past the craving is.<br /><br />2) Engaging random people in discussion which can inspire others to follow the same path, without getting evangelical on their asses. This one is hard, because you don't want to feel like you are shoving anything down people's throats, but at the same time, it doesn't make sense that those who are making positive changes in their lives should have to hide their successes.<br /><br />3) Initiating honest, open dialogue about it. There is a lot of stigma associated with eating close to 100% fresh food (and in certain circles even just the concept of eating healthy consistently!) But eating (or drinking) fresh produce works like a charm, and it was clear from the film that sharing their experiences with others (and helping those that wanted it) really helped Joe and Phil stick to their goals. Without talking to people about what they were doing, why they were doing it, what results they were getting, and learning from what people had to say, would they have done as well? It's impossible to say, but I suspect not. Ithink there's a lesson to be taken from that.<br /><br />4) Clearly demonstrating that food changes alone are not enough, that you have to look at other aspects of your life, how much exercise you are getting, and whether you are leading an active, engaged life, and opening yourself more to new experiences and new ways of being. That really resonated with me.<br /><br />5) Showing that you don't have to wait until you get a heart attack, or diabetes, or another debilitating disease to make a positive and lasting change in your health. I have multiple members of my family who have type 2 diabetes. I have no intention of being a member of that waiting list.<br /><br />In summary, great flick.

Renegade Ops lets you choose from a variety of characters with a special weapon each. You can level up and unlock new upgrades while trying to mow down as many enemies to rack up a high score. The story is actually really clich&eacute; and stupid with a commando leader named Bryant trying to stop the evil Inferno from taking over the world. The cut scenes are drawn in nice comic book style stills, but the dialog is as cheesy as it can get. No matter how you try to kill Inferno he always seems to survive and it's just one of those \""You'll never kill me Bryant! MWAHAHA!\"" type stories.<br /><br />Besides the cheesy story the action is really fun with some great graphics and physics. You drive around your vehicle using the right stick to shoot with your machine gun. Along the way you can get pick-ups to make your machine gun stronger as well as secondary ammo pick-ups like rocket launchers, rail guns, and flamethrowers. There aren't many pick-ups which is a real bummer, but this is just the start of what else there isn't much of. The enemy variety is interesting with varying degrees of difficulty, but it leads to the game being very difficult most of the time. You start off with 5 lives per level and if you lose them all its game over. The levels are very long and you will be infuriated if you have to go through all that effort again.<br /><br />My main concern about the game is that it gets very repetitive very quickly because all you do is drive around and shoot. The graphics are excellent so you could get some cinematic scripted scenes going, but instead you just follow an objective arrow around all over the place and kill everything in front of you. There are secondary objectives that lead to achievements, but they span the entire level and take way to long to complete. You are also timed on primary objective so if you don't get it done fast enough a 3 minute timer ticks down and if you don't complete it by then it's game over. This means you have to abandon the secondary and makes things just more frustrating.

The band released their debut album \""Lepidoptera\"" later the same year to critical acclaim, and their live support of it has been described as a successful one. \""The Book of Flight\"" is the band's second full length production, and was released in February 2012.<br /><br />And it is a fairly compelling sophomore effort they have made themselves, an album that will find a strong appeal amongst followers of symphonic progressive rock. That this is a conceptual creation is usually an advantage among followers of this type of art rock, and any CD that kicks of with a song clocking in at 17 minutes is bound to raise interest in itself. That the following three pieces all clock in at epic length another positive aspect for quite a few I surmise.<br /><br />But framework aside, the music itself is fairly intriguing too. It's easy to hear that the main composer in the band is the keyboardist, as quite a lot is based around the tangents for this band. Wandering piano motifs and an organ backdrop or more or less mainstay elements throughout, and soaring keyboard solos can be found aplenty. The guitar has more of a supporting role when not soloing, usually delivering harder edged, dark toned and dampened riff constructions that contrast the tangents quite nicely. Steady and often fairly sophisticated rhythms complement the dominating instruments quite nicely throughout. And the different instrumental elements are utilized in an efficient manner. Each part of this conceptual creation have multiple themes, with a nice and logical development to each of them. And they complement each other fairly well to. Sparse sequences that use guitar and piano only are used to good effect, gentle vocals and piano sequences too, but the most common mode explored and the one followers of symphonic progressive rock most likely will appreciate most are majestic,richly layered arrangements dominated by multiple keyboard textures where the guitar adds the darker tones needed for that really grandiose atmosphere to appear.<br /><br />Well made and well produced, and with some surprisingly well placed effects. The dissonant instrumental textures used on The Deception elevating this particular piece to a higher level a prime example in my opinion at least. But there's one aspect of this production that limits my enjoyment, which is the lead vocals. Dave Thwaites has a fairly uncommon vocal style, at least in my experience, and I suspect that his choice of tonal range and delivery both will be a feature that will, so to say, make or break this disc. Those who enjoy his lead vocals and are generally fond of contemporary symphonic progressive rock will regard this album as a strong one, while those who don't, those sensitive to lead vocals in particular, might find them too be too distracting. I'll readily admit to being in the latter category in this case.<br /><br />Overall this makes for a fine piece of symphonic progressive rock, and as long as you don't have a problem with the aforementioned vocal style this conceptual creation should be a nice addition to your collection. Especially if you enjoy fairly complex, contemporary sounding music of this kind explored within epic length compositional frameworks.<br /><br />My rating: 67/100",2012-08-10,555,extra_long,2012-08,music

He's had some great vocal collaboration in the past (e.g. Sofi Toufa was excellent for instance), don't get me wrong, but the vocalist Deadmau5 chose to collaborate with on this particular track I just can't stand.<br /><br />I'm a huge Deadmau5 fan, however the vocals on this song just kill it for me. Would really have appreciated a non vocal version of this track on the album as well.<br /><br />Other than that I'm really liking this album.",2012-10-21,138,medium,2012-10,music

The first episode is a bit slow and drawn out, not giving you an idea of where it's going as it's quite action heavy compared to some of the other episodes.  A lot of this show is spent on character interactions, conversations and conflicts - so it's quite 'drama' heavy.  That being said, 90% of the actors and actresses are quite well at pulling off their characters and that makes this show stand out in that sense.<br /><br />David Strathairn plays Dr. Rosen, a psychiatrist in charge of 'acclimating' what he dubs 'alphas', people with certain abilities like perfect aim, the ability to predict any sequence of events leading to an outcome and so forth.  Through this, he recruits a few of them who are stable and willing to work with him to track down rogue alphas who cause havoc while dealing with the mysterious 'Red Flag' organization.  What's a refreshing aspect of this show is that the characters all have a downside to their powers - whether it's using them or the consequences of using them.  Hicks can't achieve perfect aim if he's emotionally upset, Bill's super strength causes heart problems and Nina's pushing ability to mind-control someone makes it impossible for her to have personal relationships.  These are just a few examples of the downsides but it doesn't glamorize and make these people almost invincible - it makes them vulnerable and it strengthens the importance of Dr. Rosen really needing his whole team to accomplish his goals.<br /><br />Strathairn plays a mild, somewhat assertive Dr. Rosen but I find his performance somewhat lacking.  He's great at coming off as the expert on quasi-sci-fi phenomena to explain these abilities and yet he's too passive to seeminspiring or compelling as someone I'd want to work with and at times, risk my life.  Aside from Hicks, the least interesting alpha - all of the other main characters have their own quirks and dynamic with each other that's fun to watch.  You end up caring about them after a few episodes and despite the criticisms about too much personal drama, a series like this that doesn't focus so much on the powers but more so the 'politics' needs to depend on drama and for that, it's a refreshing action drama heroes series that deserves a try - or a second and third!",2012-09-08,434,long,2012-09,videos

At least it used to be but now most PC games seem to be not much, if any better than the junk they shovel out for consoles.<br /><br />I had this a while back and had forgotten how good it was barring a few cheap shots by the developers. It downloaded fine and works fine on my Windows 7 64bit. Not sure why so many people are having problems with that but it starts and plays just fine for me. One thing I did notice and have read about in the forums before is that for some reason the fan on my graphics card doesn't turn up when it starts getting hot. Not sure why this is and I'm not alone with it either but turning it up manually before starting the game works okay.<br /><br />I actually like the alien twist to the story that shows up later. Don't mind the swarms too much either which is something that usually turns me completely off of any video game that uses them. I think it's an extremely cheap and overused method of adding content to a video game. I'll tell you one thing I absolutely hate in this game and that's the VTOL aircraft. The very first time you ever fly this thing you're immediately faced with a swarm of alien ships that you have to shoot down... as they are shooting at you. To me, this is pure stupidity but it's about the only significant shortcoming, in my opinion,  that the game has.<br /><br />There are some bugs but not many. Probably the worst is the occasional failure to load the next objective pointer or acknowledge on the list that you have completed the last one. It'll give you the objective and it's location on the map (usually) but no directional indicator and it won't fade out the objective you've just completed, making you think there is something left to do. Kinda confusing to explain it and it doesn't happen often, usually only after you've rescued the first hostage early in the game and then it'll quit. If it happens to you, you'll see what I mean but just ignore it and head sort of east southeast to a waterfall and continue on with the game. Once you reach the next objective area it'll go ahead and fix itself.<br /><br />So, the game is very good and eventhough it's a few years old now the graphics quality is probably the best available in any PC game to date and the overall quality - voice acting, physics, AI, etc. is all top shelf programming. You're going to need a fairly good system to run it though. You definitely don't need a custom gaming rig (haven't seen a game yet that made owning one worth the cost) but you can forget using a low end card and weak processor for anything but the worst, probably unplayable performance.<br /><br />Just don't forget about that GPU fan issue.o a waterfall and continue on with the game.

It would be nice if each recipe appeared on its own page.<br /><br />The first recipe calls for 1/3 can of condensed cream soup.  You mix sour cream, soup, celery, pour it over chicken breasts, and bake at 400 for 2-1/2 hours.  Um, no.  No no no.  There is no way a boneless skinless chicken breast takes 2-1/2 hours at 400.  I cook whole chickens in under 2 hours!<br /><br />The author even says in another recipe \""With chicken as well, unless you have a whole chicken, preparation and cooking time is always less than an hour combined.\""<br /><br />The instructions are written in a numbered list format and are sometimes rather stilted.<br />\""In a bowl that is large you will need to combine the milk, egg, salt, cheese, and oats.\""<br />\""Let the boiling water ooze around the spaghetti.\""<br /><br />\""Pour enough water to cover the potatoes.  Boil it and leave it for twenty minutes to get cooked.  Check to see that it can be easily pierced.\""<br /><br />Measurements and units are not consistently written - some call for cups, some call for grams, some have metric and volume measurements.  One recipe calls for 1/2 cup white wine, 1 cup chicken stock, and 300 mL heavy cream.  Another calls for \""two third of a cup of ketchup.\""<br /><br />Some recipes say they serve 8, others have no information about how many people the recipe should serve.<br /><br />I know it seems obvious, but the Shredded Chicken Salad recipe really should specify *cooked* chicken.<br /><br />In addition to the 2.5 hours for chicken breasts above, there were a couple of other errors that make me wonder about the overall accuracy and attention to detail:<br />6 tbsp cup fresh parsley leaves,<br />The stroganoff recipe is called Ground Beef Stroganoff.  It calls for beef strips in the ingredients, but says ground beef in the instructions.  It doesn't give any kind of time or quantity information for simmering, just \""until vegetables are tender and stock is reduced.\""  The description promises step by step instructions to make these recipes easy to cook for anyone.<br />In the Tuna and Tomato Salad:  \""Prepare your vinaigrette by whisking together some olive oil, vinegar, black pepper and salt.\"" No quantities are given.  While the recipe following is for a vinaigrette with white vinegar, the information should either be given here or text saying \""prepare the vinaigrette using the recipe that follows.\""<br />Keema Pitta Pockets - two spoons vinegar<br />Fish pie - 1lb of pepper.  (That's a *pound* of pepper.)<br />Chicken Fajitas - \""Put the chicken in an oven at 350 degrees and grill for 15 - 20 minutes or until the chicken is done inside.\""  This would be baking rather than grilling.  Cooking terms have specific meanings.<br /><br />The meatballs recipe says \""start to boil the oil and just as it starts to boil, put your meatballs in.\""  This is in a skillet, not a fryer.  Honestly, this is not something I would want to do.  Someone else may be fine with it, but to me, I'll cook with hot oil but boiling oil on the stovetop is a way different issue to me.<br /><br />Sometimes the author seems to be a bit confused about her purpose and message.  At the beginning, we're told that these are recipes to help when you're stumped for dinner, and the description refers to family meals.  However, then we have Garlic Mushroom and Prawn Spaghetti.  \""Delightful and hassle-free, it's perfect for a fancy dinner at home.\""  At least for me, prawns, wine, and heavy cream don't really fit in the \""cheap\"" category and aren't something I'd think of as a cheap, easy, family meal.<br /><br />Creamy Potato Salad - author says it's \""delicious and nutritious.\""  I'll agree it can be delicious.  I'm a bit skeptical about the nutritious claim, what with the mayo, evaporated milk, sugar, butter and all.  I'm not sure potatoes, onions, eggs, and celery do enough to make it \""nutritious\"" in those circumstances.<br /><br />All in all, this just doesn't work for me.

I was thoroughly delighted with the acting of Kate Hudson (Marley Corbett) while looking for her to pull out her acting chops once again as I have seen her do before. In her engrossing portrayal of Penny Lane in Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical account 'Almost Famous', Hudson shines as the brightest and most promising new star on the horizon. In this movie, she also is able to deliver on several levels and in diverse genres.  She is not pigeonholed into being just a comedic actress.  While there is the element of comedy also present, Hudson also pulls the tears and much drama.<br /><br />Set in New Orleans, Marley is on top as an advertising executive and at the pinnacle of her career succeeding on her own terms.  She is fulfilled through her high power status enjoying many gratifying friendships and is completely lovable as her story unfolds and develops.<br /><br />Marley's most relevant friendship is with the wonderful Rosemarie DeWitt (Renee). Kathy Bates and Treat Williams portray her divorced parents.  First completely self-absorbed, emotionally vacant and severely critical of Marley.  One could easily respect her apprehension toward committed relationships with her bickering mother and father. As Beverly and Jack, they give a wonderful turn in their spot-on roles of her parents.<br /><br />Marley begins to notice herself feeling drained, fatigued and being told she is losing weight.  At her friends urging she visits Dr. Julian Goldstein, the superlative actor Gael Garcia Bernal in a different role for him. I enjoyed Bernal in this movie. He is charming through the dichotomy of feelings he starts having for Marley and is quite shy owning a sweet uncomfortable nature. After he relinquishes his position as her doctor, the two visit a jazz club in the French Quarter. Here we are treated to the music of local musician Ivan Neville (of the 'Neville Brothers') and his band.  The two begin talking more while singer Macy Gray lends a lovely background song as the two inevitably fall in love.<br /><br />Marley finally begins to resolve massive relationship issues with her parents and going forward to start relating to them as their daughter.  Co-workers and her very important friends need attending to also, the priority being the emotionally distraught Renee. The two actresses share an intense scene at Renee's home that may draw tears as DeWitt punches it home.<br /><br />There is an underlying subplot with this. For me, the movie would be better served by excluding it and taking it as the relationship driven movie it intends to be.  It is a solid piece with or without it.  The movie is a great view either way you see it while Hudson works through her little bit of heaven.ray lends a lovely background song as the two inevitably fall in love.<br /><br />Marley finally begins to resolve massive relationship issues with her parents and going forward to start relating to them as their daughter.

The quartet's eight-track debut is heavily weighted towards a classic rock style, which is underpinned by the songwriting talents of lead vocalist / guitarist Dan Sawler. The other members of the band are James Densley (lead guitar / vocals), Dion Crocker (bass) and Jeff Roper (drums / vocals).<br /><br />In a crowded genre, it's often difficult to stand out, but My Living Will are literally making all the right noises. Songwriter Sawler mostly avoids lyrical clich&eacute;s and is in possession of a fine clear voice. This is successfully contrasted by the band, who eschew slickness for a gritty enthusiasm (is that a hint of Replacements in the mix?) and the result is a record that errs towards \""Exile On Main Street\"" rather than \""Slippery When Wet\"" - if not in sound, then most definitely in attitude.<br /><br />At just under half an hour, there's no room for filler, and \""Shallow Sleep\"" doesn't disappoint. It begins with the sweeping title track, with guitarist Densley raising the temperature with each progression. It's followed by \""Wanted You to Stay\"", a slowie, but choppy chords and an intense performance keeps the record on track. \""She Knows I Know\"" is cut from the same cloth and is just as good - it's studio trickery on the vocals adding another stratum. The album ends with the six and a half minute \""Keep It Simple\"". You'll want more, but that's what `repeat' buttons are for.",2012-02-04,278,long,2012-02,music

There is one great chapter devoted to explaining the reasoning behind different getaway plans, but the down to the second scheming found in Man With the Getaway Face and The Outfit is strangely absent considering that this is just another heist novel.<br /><br />The book does have its moments, though, as Parker's ruthlessness continues to grow.

On our next computer, I kept having problems with my pc acting strange - it would play the windows startup tune two or three times, and other things.  I bought Norton again, and it stopped these weird problems.  It seemed great, but never seemed to find any other issues for the rest of the year.

I really wanted something specifically designed for women after they've had babies. Not weight loss, just strength building and muscle toning. In this video she even talks about diastase rectos(sp?). I was so happy to know that I do not have that, and she explains how to check at the beginning. I have only been using the first part of this video so far since I have a tendency to over do it. I go to the gym 3 days a week, I do 30minutes of cardio, then 15 reps on all the machines and then I do 3 exercises a trainer recommended to me, and then I do 15sets or seconds of each of the exercises from the video. I can definitely tell that these exercises are doing what they are suppose to. Since I am doing other exercises too I can't say it is all from the video but I believe it is effective. Some of the exercise have definitely gotten easier since I have been doing them. Lindsay Brinn's voice is kind of annoying but she does a good job of explaining each thing.<br /><br />I had to take one star off because being new to exercising I felt that I needed some kind of guide on how many to do.

Its more of an instructional video. If you do some kind of cardio along with these then you will see results.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/13/2012:<br />I am now moved on to the 3rd section of this video. I have to say at this stage it feels too easy. I have been working hard on these exercises which I still either do 15 repetitions or 15 seconds 3 times a week. This video really helped a lot. I thought it would be impossible for my stomach to be anything close to flat after 4 kids but its really getting flatter and flatter fast now. I think this video is perfect to lead you into exercising and after kids!

It's also buggy, and you WILL run into constant crashing while playing this piece.<br /><br />The story picks up at sometime during DX3 but it's mostly needless: it's entire purpose is to only add more description behind the hyron project and how evil belltower is. What made the whole hryon project thing cool in DX3 was how mysterious and complicated it was, and it's subtle relation to the plot. You didn't know the full story why those women were hooked to the machine, and if you looked close enough you could see wings indented on their pods, adding to the symbolic nature of the game. ML tries to EXPLAIN THIS. Its like if someone started explaining a good joke to you that you already got, or someone went to great lengths to explain every element of an abstract painting. It's unnecessary.<br /><br />(BTW, Jenson mentions nothing about these discoveries and experiences to Pritchard or hugh darrow in the core game)<br /><br />Most people would explain the gameplay as just more DX, but that's only in a literal sense. ML's main problem is it punishes stealth players by forcing them to listen to conversation after conversation, countless times by the belltower clone guards until they turn their back and walk somewhere else so you can sneak through. They are always set up to be staring toward your position, and it is intentional. Even if you are gunning around, you will eventually run into these contamination check areas that are pretty much loading screens that take up a good 45 seconds of your time, and combined with stealth, it's quite a test on the nerves. For a hacker chars, there's not that much to do outside of turning things off, as there are no USEFUL robots or turrets to convert most of the time, and just the very minigame itself is a LOT harder now for some reason, and a hell of a lot less enjoyable.<br /><br />Considering the DLC is just a singular mission in one location, it all tends to mesh together and the design theme of maze like corridor trekking rarely changes. If you don't find yourself minding the level design, your eyes and brain will. I also take issue with the marketing pitch that Jenson would have to rely on his augment-less skills for a duration of the game, because this is a flat out lie. Not even 3 minutes in, you get 5 PRAXIS KITS, and many more there and on after. There is an achievement that challenges you to only beat the game without praxis kits and weapons, but just daring to play the DLC through again is a challenge in and of itself.<br /><br />If there's any redeeming qualities about this DLC, it's the incredible voice acting by the 2 lead characters, notably the character Quinn. He is a just pleasure to even listen to. His character is sharply written and actually the most interesting out of them all, especially within the final meeting. I won't spoil much, but the final cutscene is almost good enough reason to finish Missing Link. Certain review sites would say that the \""boss battle\"" at the end was handled better than HR, but I strongly disagree since it still forces your character into violence. There's another part that forces you to make a hard decision between life and death for many characters, but this can actually be bypassed if you know how to beforehand, eliminating any tension for the situation.<br /><br />To close this off, I'll mention that Missing link crashed a total of 6 times in my first playthrough. I play this on the 360 so that might be the problem, but I never experienced such things during the actual HR game, and I have completed that multiple times. It's also a 5 or 3 hour thing, depending on how good you are at this game. It's also 15 dollars. 15 DOLLARS.<br /><br />Overall, I must be the only person who disliked this package. If you're still interested in buying this after reading this review, I would recommend buying some Tylenol before loading it up.",2012-02-05,720,extra_long,2012-02,games

And I liked some of them, and didn't like some of the others.  Cox and Danes weren't the greatest actors in this movie, but luckily the movie was good enough on its own that you could ignore them.  They just didn't have chemistry together and some of the acting seemed forced to me.  Sure, they had some shining moments (because Danes played a star, ha!), but largely I found their performances average.  Pfeiffer and De Niro on the other hand were excellent.  I loved the sometimes inept but brutal way that Pfeiffer played the witch.  She seemed to really enjoy her role and that showed.  De Niro as Captain Shakespeare was hilarious and this role was completely different than most of the others ones I've seen him in.  The supporting actors did a good job as well.<br /><br />The plot followed the book pretty well.  Sure they changed the ending, but that's because Hollywood seems to prefer happy endings.

However, I think Billy Talent 2 was such a strong, powerful, and forceful record. It set the bar way too high for the band, there was not a single weak track on it. Unfortunately, that only means this one can disappont by comparison, and it looks like I was correct.<br /><br />BT2 isn't a particularly bad album. I guess it's, at its core, an alright album. But it lacks the hot, raging fire that made its predecessors so irresistible. There's too many slow tracks on this record. It lacks the soul and heart of the previous two albums as well. It's easily also not as ambitious. There are several subtle hints that it may reach the greatness of BT2, but ultimately it falls apart around itself.<br /><br />Devil On My Shoulder is an alright track, it makes you think a bit of This Is How It Goes, but in its core it leaves you thinking \""they can do better than this... I've heard it.\""<br /><br />Rusted From The Rain I guess is an enjoyable track if you're in the mood, but it can become annoying very quickly.<br /><br />Saint Veronika is catchy and has an irresistibly ambitious sound and baseline, but it's ruined by lyrics that were done before in Nothing To Lose (which is infinitely better) and Ben's attempts to emulate Bruce Dickinson in the verses are just annoying (only Bruce can sound like Bruce and it would sound great, Ben).<br /><br />Tears Into Wine is the first great track on the record. It has. BTII feel to it. I can imagine it being a fun track to get together with my buddies and get smashed to. In fact part of me wonders why they didn't put it on BTII in the first place, it would have complemented such a fun album. Either way it's a track deserving of a better album.<br /><br />White Sparrows is... Meh. I guess I am willing to listen but put it on BTII and I'd have hit the skip button.<br /><br />Pocketful of Dreams is silly, nonsensical, and preachy as hell, their ultimate low point. Mainly the lyrics (Vanity's her only charity/and she makes her donations to the Tiffany's/Life's so hard without a credit card to get by, and then there's this particularly cringe worthy gem, You're scared to fall/'Cause you may break a nail) and the overly pop-punk chord progression are just gag worthy. HATE IT!!!<br /><br />The Dead Can't Testify. Finally another great track. Slow, crushing, almost creepy. Just brilliant.<br /><br />Diamond On A Landmine is a lame attempt to emulate the Police, but we've heard it before (Every Little Thing She Does is Magic), and better, when the Police do it.<br /><br />Turn Your Back, boring city.<br /><br />Ditto for Sudden Movements.<br /><br />Definition of Destiny tries to be like Voices of violence, but it tries too hard, and doesn't stand well on its own merits.<br /><br />In all, it's not BAD. I mean I guess it's good background music, and some tracks have repeat value, but it lacks the steam of the previous album and the joyful ambition.

If you like new & old school breaks with dark & light thrown in, you won't be disappointed. If you don't know the difference between Drum n Bass and Breakbeats, you may want to do some homework before giving Baby Anne the thumbs down (as another reviewer did on another album of hers 'cause he was really ignorant)<br />Make no mistake- Baby Anne truly is the queen of breaks and never ceases to blow my shit away!!!<br /><br />So here's the crap with this- and it's all about Amazon...<br />I purchased this album as an mp3 download. The download is fine, the content works on my device, etc., etc.<br />The album is a \""DJ Continuous Mix\"" which means that the artist mixed 12 tracks into one long album. Pretty straight forward right?<br />The problem I have is that the tracks on the album have been hacked up, i.e. no continuous mix. I don't know how Amazon acquires its digital content; perhaps it varies from artist to artist. In this case it seems that someone sat down with an original CD and chopped it up into 12 tracks, with poor fade-outs and choppy, awkward transitions between songs, beats missing, etc., resulting in definitely NOT a continuous DJ mix. And yes, my iPod is current and supports gapless playback.<br />There is, to be fair, the last track (#13) which IS all the songs in continuous mix, but it's ONE track as opposed to 12 gapless songs, the point being that if I want to skip to the next track, I can't- it's all one.<br />Thus, the way the 12 tracks are assembled in the download makes the music kinda painful to listen to if you're used to/looking for the uninterrupted flow of DJ music...<br />Amazon's policy is to not offer a refund of digital content, and for very good, obvious reasons, BUT if the product is flawed and not available as the artist originally intended, then I would say a refund is warranted, or fix the problem and allow a re-download of the fixed album. Wouldn't that make sense?<br />My best analogy to those who might say \""get over it, just listen to the music\"" would be also along the lines of music, but let's take a more iconic rock album- \""Dark Side Of The Moon.\"" Let's say Amazon messed with the tracks just a bit, for some convenience on their part, or a technician who didn't understand why it was important to have the album be exactly as Pink Floyd intended it, hacked it up, changed a few transitions, dropped a few beats, and then released it. Crap- are you kidding me? Music dorks from all over the world would be freaking out!!! There would be protests and riots in the streets (ok, maybe not big riots), bloggers would skewer Amazon, etc., etc. My point is, this album and its artist should be given exactly the same respect as Roger Waters, period.<br />So as I was listening to this album last night, I imagined some music snob who hated electronic music was tasked with the chore of turning this \""crap CD into a crap digital download\"", and that's exactly what he did...<br />I wrote Amazon customer service with basically this same rant, hopefully they will address this (minor in the grand scheme of the world, really) issue, and fix it.<br />Thanks for putting up with this long-ass diatribe.",2012-08-29,606,extra_long,2012-08,music

The latter which is Transubstans Records, a label specializing in artists with somewhat of a vintage oriented hard rock or art rock sound.<br /><br />In the case of Odyssey we're dealing with a slight derivation from the norm for this label however. While it's relatively easy to hear that Odyssey is yet another band that do know their Black Sabbath as well as hard psychedelic rock from the 70's, these traits are not truly dominant aspects of their repertoire even if  present in one shape or another throughout.<br /><br />Instead I'd pull in punk and hardcore as more important aspects of their music, alongside grunge. In the case of the former two I guess post punk should be mentioned too, as the compositions at hand did give me a few associations to a band I guess many hard rock fans and progressive rock fans alike aren't too familiar with, which is New Model Army. Not in sound as such however, but to a certain extent in approach.<br /><br />The basic element of Odyssey is the bass guitar, providing thundering, energetic and massive textures throughout. In a manner that made me think about good, old Nuclear Assault actually, albeit not quite as frantic as this old hardcore-tinged thrash act was back towards the end of the 1980's. Heavy, energetic drum patterns emphasize the high energy and high impact base sound of the band quite nicely, and does so in a fairly refined manner, at least refined enough to avoid any direct hardcore and punk comparisons.<br /><br />The guitars have more of a dual, or perhaps triple, role in the proceedings. Sabbath-tinged riffs with nods in the direction of both grunge and garage rock represents one part of the role filled by the axe, the second one is to provide melodic and mostly repeated overlays with a closer relation to 70's hard psychedelic rock, and occasionally we're treated to some twisted blues inspired soloing too. But we're also given the occasional staccato riff barrages that have a stronger resemblance to early 80's hardcore and the UK punk movement in here, alongside occasional added noise elements thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />But the punk and post punk associations are rather minuscule in the instrumental department, as they are just a few among several details that appears throughout each and every song. An element more thoroughly executed in this manner are the lead vocals, aggressively shouted more often than not, and only in rare moments of gentler tranquillity are we treated to a singing voice. Shouting is the norm, and fairly aggressively at that.<br /><br />Which brings me back to punk, post punk and grunge. Odyssey's debut is a production I'd describe as a likely end result if a band like Soundgarden had been asked to incorporate some punk and post punk aesthetics to their music. With the aggression of the punk movement honed in on the vocal department, but retaining the more refined metal orientation as far as instrumental performance go. Add in a somewhat lo-fi production and what might be described as a garage rock general approach and I believe most grounds have been covered.<br /><br />The end result is a heavy hitting, high energy and aggressive slice of metal that does reach out to territories not commonly explored by other bands. It's more basic in sound than actual performance, and the shouted vocals adds a primitive edge to the proceedings that does cover up instrumental performances and arrangements that are rather more developed. The basic sounding production another masquerade that hides a lot more than it reveals in that department. An album recommended to fans of aggressive, dark metal in general, and for some reason I have a gut feeling that quite a few Motorhead fans might have a soft spot for this album. Otherwise I'd guess that fans of aforementioned Nuclear Assault might be a key audience for this band alongside those who think that Jesus Christ Pose represented the ultimate achievement of aforementioned grunge stars Soundgarden.<br /><br />My rating: 73/100",2012-08-13,725,extra_long,2012-08,music

A: This Album Is Real,"Composer Rixa White's solo electronic extravaganza appears, at first blush, to have much in common with, Vangelis, Jon Anderson's Yes, and other synthpop veterans. It's certainly a nostalgic throwback. But Silentaria doesn't merely mimic thirty-year-old pop icons; it also throws in an aggressive bass line that provides a fuller sound than first-wave synthpop ever enjoyed, bolstered with occasional dance floor rhythms and muscular mixed genre sounds.<br /><br />On its website, Silentaria bills itself as \""the Voice of Emptiness,\"" presumably in reference to Buddhist meditation techniques. But I'm not sure how well it lives up to that name. I mean that in a good way: this album has a very full, rich sound, making best use of its conventional and programmed instruments. It pushes Eastern pentatonic scales and Western staggered harmonies together in ways that, while not always surprising, are certainly never boring.<br /><br />Like many such ambient music ensembles, Silentaria is essentially one man, and as much a triumph of engineering as musicality. Rixa White, a software entrepreneur, turned his attention to composing and recording in 2010, and this is his second album. Like those who paved the road he travels (Yanni and Kitaro come to mind), White uses his synthesizer to combine conventional piano composition and a programmed orchestra in a large, theatrical soundscape.<br /><br />Silentaria's music relies less on virtuosity and more on pattern recognition, as this style often does. But Silentaria is not satisfied to have its music permeate below the level of conscious recognition, in the best Hearts of Space tradition. Tracks like \""Vital Doubts\"" and \""Consciousness\"" have athletic pacing and driving percussion lines that demand to be heard. Even White's softer compositions shift tempos and instrumentations enough to keep your attention hooked.<br /><br />Then, when White has your attention, he upsets your expectations. Tracks like \""Curtains Over Eyes\"" and \""Real Fantasia\"" may sound like ordinary ambient music if you listen with only half an ear, but closer examination reveals unanticipated contrasts. Shakuhachi beneath skirling electric guitars; intricate symphonic orchestrations over pining wordless sighs. White's compositions reward active listeners with curiosity enough to follow his changes.<br /><br />White also makes well-considered use of samples. Sounds of weather, children playing, and animals in their habitat crop up at unexpected times, reminiscent of the pioneering work by acts like Mira Calix and Atom Heart. Even the human voices that peek through the wall of electronica come by way of White's programming. I particularly appreciate that White can synth human voices without using that ubiquitous, tiresome AutoTune flutter we keep hearing everywhere.<br /><br />And White also isn't above a certain amount of winking irony. My favorite track, \""Sorrowful Truth,\"" moves with great thoughtfulness, but nothing like the mournful plod the title implies. As it accelerates toward the end, throwing on playful woodwind hooks and humming wordless choir, we start to grasp White's message: that when sorrow and truth come into competition, only one can triumph. Sorrow may be necessary, but truth is brimming with vitality and might.<br /><br />I can't pretend I have no problems with this album. Some of the tracks don't live up to the high standards White sets himself. \""Diversion,\"" for instance, is undercut by a cheesy beeping descant, an obvious composer's fingerprint somewhere between a touch-tone phone and R2-D2. And the title track, one of the few with lyrics (and few enough it is), features a growling male voice demanding: \""What's real?\"" A female voice provides the answer every Beatles fan has already supplied: \""Nothing is real.\""<br /><br />But these brief misfires do not set the tone for the entire album. On the whole, we can roll our eyes at such frankly ordinary choices in the odd deep album cut because the rest of the album has the power to carry us through. At least it tries, and tries harder than any five random pop confections. White's smart orchestration and intricate programming result in a sound that is at once rooted in an electronic tradition, yet not so hidebound that it sounds the same as every other New Age drone we've all heard before.<br /><br />Much ambient music sounds good for one or two tracks, but sticking with the artists over the length of an album can be difficult. As track mounts on track, they often reveal rhythms so unvarying that you could do Pilates with them and never miss a beat. Silentaria, however, has crafted an album that is emphatically not a soundtrack for jogging or vacuuming. Rexa White puts himself through hard changes, and expects you to join him on the journey.",2012-07-16,759,extra_long,2012-07,music

Some may find the similarities to other sports tales (the obvious one being Stallone's \""Rocky\"") a bit jarring but, in my opinion at least, \""Warrior\"" stands out from the crowd.<br /><br />It tells the tale of two brothers in conflict over a family past. Tom Hardy plays the tortured ex marine, desperate to redeem his imaginary failure in the Iraq war whilst Joel Edgerton, hardy's brother, is a financially struggling science teacher clambering to provide for his family and stave off bankruptcy. Nick Nolte really stands out with a fantastic performance playing the reformed alcoholic father striving for forgiveness from his sons and, I think, nails the part with real emotion and power. Throughout the film his guilt over his past is laid bare by his character culminating in a heart breaking scene where he falls off the wagon giving a glimpse at his alcoholic history.<br /><br />The brothers have very different motivations. Hardy's character is difficult to like but excellent none the less, spending a lot of the film brooding over his perceived conduct whilst serving as a marine and struggling/refusing to reconcile with not only his father but his brother as well. There is nobility there however, conveyed in his reason for entering the contest. After all, he intends to give the prize money to the widow of a fallen comrade making the viewer have conflicting feelings for him. By that I mean he is a generally unlikable character but has a noble purpose. Hardy plays the part excellently, giving a convincing portrayal as a lost soul intent on redemption and has a real air of menace both in and out of the ring.<br /><br />His brother played by Edgerton, is a completely different kettle of fish. A school teacher, he impresses a sense of civility as a family man simply trying to provide for his clan. Throughout the film the viewer is convinced that, given the choice,he wouldn't delve into the violent world which he is part of. Edgerton brilliantly portrays the grim desperation of a man with little choice left.<br /><br />The film itself is well paced with an excellently balanced mixture of heartfelt emotion and bone shattering fight sequences. The general atmosphere is similar to that of the aforementioned \""Rocky\"" in terms of the fact it's set in a city hit by recession with a war torn world stage backdrop, not to mention the underdog main story.<br /><br />And therein lay the only jarring aspect of the story for me. Hardy's character is portrayed throughout the entire film as a virtually unstoppable behemoth of the fighting world, making short work of every competitor he faces without exception. And I mean that as literally as possible as the average length of one of Hardy's fights is around thirty seconds. Edgerton's character however, is never portrayed as much more than average, his only strength being the motivation to provide for his family. As a result of this, the ending feels distinctly unbelievable with Hardy's much more ferocious and capable character being beaten by his significantly weaker and less capable brother. The film would have avoided this if Hardy's character maybe had a few more close calls in the tournament, possibly giving the idea he is at least beatable but instead, he wades through rival competitors with apparently no effort.<br /><br />Regardless of this last point however, I still would rate this film very highly indeed and would recommend it to anyone who is fan of this genre. A great film throughout, slightly let down with an implausible ending.",2012-02-28,609,extra_long,2012-02,videos

I was very ill with an unknown disease. My life consisted of sleeping, walking and watching The Stargate series. One day my son asked me if I had ever played Eve Online, I'd never heard of it. I downloaded the game for *free* for the 2 week trial expecting a mild diversion to take my mind off my troubles for a few weeks. When I fired up the game and made my first gate jump I couldn't contain myself. \""I'm inside Stargate, I'm playing Stargate!\"" I excitedly exclaimed to my son. This was the space portion of Stargate, not the ground part. (My hope is the Dust 514, the PS3 based companion game to Eve online will be expanded to include more Eve-like features on the planet side).<br /><br />I played Eve for about 3.5 years. I eventually had 5 accounts with 3 of them active at any time. I payed for 3 months at a time and staggered 3 accounts so I was paying less than $40/month for all 3. There are 4 major races in Eve and I have characters for each. Of the main professions I cover most of them. I have an Ammar Industrialist, a Gallente Marketing expert, a Minmatar Miner, and my first character and only female a Caldari Special Forces Missions Expert. Even though the only cost for Eve is a $15 usage fee, twice I have bought \""Plex\"", a legal way to purchase in-game money from CCP authorized dealers to purchase skill books and brain implants, necessary items to advance in the game.<br /><br />I also participated in many of the major activities. I was involved in 2 large war battles between factions, 400+ players per side, in null-security space. I didn't get involved in their politics but you can. I belonged to a good multi-national corporation which was under war declaration most of the time I was there, conditional warring in high security space is allowed. I have dabbled in role playing as time allowed and I enjoy it.<br /><br />I own my own corporation as a tax shelter, all of the people in the corp are me. I've engaged the dangerous Sleeper race that lives inside of wormhole space with an impromptu gang. I gained control of part of the Gold dog tag market until I got spanked by a much wealthier player. I've scammed and I've given and I prefer the latter. I even took on the entire Amarr Navy in a non-playing character mission involving \""cattle\"" in my lowly Drake battle cruiser. Many don't believe me but I looted 3 Amarr General's dog tags to prove it.<br /><br />If you are the intelligent studious type, this game is for you.<br />If you came in 3rd at the Halo regional and you are all about PvP, this game has real consequences. What a rush.<br />Wow players that love to quest and explore, get real, play Eve, Eve is real, maybe too real for many.<br />If you are a casual player that just wants to socialize, join a mining/industrial corp.<br />Can't get enough of that tight knit group feeling? Join a wormhole or a pirate corp. or a mercenary corp working for a major alliance.

I had to leave the gaming world for a while but I will be back one day, with a vengeance. This game truly is whatever you make out of it.<br /><br />PS.

I'm generally a positive and cheerful consumer of all kinds of movies, not given to being overly critical.  I have also never written a screenplay much less produced and directed one.  I have, however, seen my share of movies, both good and bad, and I have to say that this is not a movie.  Really not. Sorry.<br /><br />The 'acting' can not by any stretch of the imagination be called acting.  The lines are delivered in a stilted way after a long pause.  Often one character will say something, and then the camera hiccups and the scene continues with a slightly changed posture.  It's very choppy.  It's almost as if the actors needed to stop filming after every line, and they don't know how to get back into the right position before picking up again.  Camera angles are also clumsy and choppy, with way too many cuts and start-stops.  The weak story is delivered in monotone with no continuity or exposition.  The whole unlikely thing takes place in a very tacky house, supposedly in the Caribbean, but you'd never know that from this exercise.<br /><br />Positive things:  I thought the original music was very good.  Also, the actors spoke clearly and articulated so that I could hear and understand them.  This is not always so in today's films.  I was grateful.  There were no egregious grammatical errors.  Again, grateful.<br /><br />Not so positive:  The cast, the crew, the dialog, the story, the denouement, the exposition, the production values, the camera work (it can't really be called cinematography).

However, it is pretty obvious they do not play test their games as most of their titles have a couple of very annoying \""features\"" that really ruin gameplay.  In the Westward series, for example, constant earthquakes in your hometown.<br /><br />In Tradewinds 2, the frustrating gameplay \""features\"" are:<br /><br />1) After a few initial voyages, you are constantly under attack from pirates, every single time you set sail.  You will find yourself yelling at the screen: \""Stop it!  Stop it!  Stop it!  Enough already!\""  A periodic pirate attack keeps things interesting.  Constant pirate attacks are just..... frustrating.<br /><br />2) Prices are completely random every time you enter a port.  Some might like that because like a box of chocolates, one never knows what one is going to get, however, it makes it completely impossible to set up a trade route and it almost never matters where you go nor what you buy, except figuring out that prices have a specific range and always buy when its near the lowest.  The only exception to that is that one month of the year each port will have a specific commodity that is either high or low, but you have to buy hundreds of drinks (clicking each time) at the bars before you discover them all.  And it is virtually useless since every voyage takes one week, you can only use the information for a port twice a year.<br /><br />3) As you follow the quests, the pirate attacks get harder and harder.  Relatively quickly the cost to patch up and re-arm your ship will soon exceed any money you earn by trading goods and you cannot make any progress in the game.  You discover that the only way to \""win\"" the game is to stop following quests relatively early and sit there and churn for gold.  Millions of it.  World of Warcraft players call this \""farming\"" and it is just tediously dull, especially since prices are completely random and you're always under attack.<br /><br />4) You cannot buy nor order the ship you want at shipyards.  If there is a ship available to buy, and there often is not, it will be some random ship with random features.  When you get to the better ships, the ship offered is usually a lesser vessel than you already have, so, again, you have to sit there and go back and forth between ports that have a shipyard again and again and again until you finally see the ship you want.  Since prices are random and you have to churn for gold, and lots of gold early in the game, just pick two cities with shipyards and go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.  Even a five year old would find that dull.<br /><br />Normally, most casual games are safe for youngsters, but I cannot entirely say that with Tradwinds 2.  The best profits are made by trading illegal goods and doing it by using voodoo against port authorities.  Further, some of the humor has an adult angle to it.<br /><br />Tradewinds 2 could have been a good casual game, with trading and role playing elements.  As it is, it is merely frustrating, dull and repetitious.",2012-03-24,547,extra_long,2012-03,games

I was using Linux on this netbook with few issues, but it's difficult to impossible to get VCDS running under Wine.  Rather than fight the man, I restored the initial software load from a clonezilla backup, scraped all the crapware off, then installed AVG, Chrome, and VCDS.  Using Win 7 starter was a real eye opener for me and has only reinforced my already biased impression that Microsoft is a business first, and a software provider second.  Starter should be labelled as Win 7 Crippled because only an ethically funky company could offer a compromised version of their operating system and insist that it's for your own good.<br /><br />I'm of a very mixed feeling about the upgrade itself-the actual upgrade to Windows Home Premium from Starter went flawlessly and was over in 20 minutes.  Amazon provides the needed key, the Windows Anytime program accepted the key and did it's thing, and now I'm running Home Premium.  I would give it 5 stars for doing exactly what it's claimed to do-but that would overlook how Microsoft has created an artificial situation to chisel yet more money out of their users.  All the key does is activate features that were already present and loaded during the initial software load on the netbook.  That's it.  One could argue that these features were not needed for a netbook, but disabling customization features (such as changing the background) and limiting how many programs one can run simultaneously is simply taking advantage.  Even a little netbook has nearly the same processing power than a decent laptop from the heyday of Windows XP, there's simply no reason for these limitations.  It's not as if they customized Starter for netbook use to any great degree, it has the same basic interface as the other versions of Win 7 with less flexibility.  The fact is once upgraded to Home Premium the netbook runs just as well (if not better) as it did under Starter, and I can now do some customization and tweaking I couldn't do before.  In other words, Starter does not provide any advantages to a netbook over Home Premium and the cost to Microsoft to produce the software package itself is exactly the same.  So I'm knocking a point off just because Microsoft has done it yet again, and found a way to provide an upgrade path that shouldn't exist.<br /><br />TL:DR-buy the key and upgrade Starter to Home Premium.  It's a ripoff but it's the only way to get full use out of the operating system.",2012-05-24,455,long,2012-05,software

Most action epics constitute theme park thrill rides with outlandish stunts that cost mega bucks not only to stage but also to enhance with dazzling CGI effects.  Hollywood always tries to scale down their budgets but rarely their believability when it comes to action pictures.  Venezuela-born director Eduardo Rodriguez and freshman scenarist Gary Spinelli strive for credibility in \""Stash House,\"" co-starring Dolph Lundgren and Briana Evigan. The chronological narrative takes place during the course of a day and night in a way that preserves the unities of time, place, and setting. This well-made but often nondescript melodrama weds three genres: the surveillance camera saga, house pictures, and the narcotics thriller.  Lots of movies are now depicting their narratives from the perspective of surveillance cameras, like the \""Paranormal Activity\"" flicks. We've also had a rash of movies about haunted houses. Usually, these movies concern houses that are either inhabited by supernatural adversaries as well as a setting for evil things.

One of the cartel gunmen is Dolph Lundgren and he isn't happy about the circumstances.  \""Stash House\"" isn't bad and the husband and wife twosome are appropriately sympathetic, while Dolph plays a murderous villain who occasionally comes to their aid.

With a variety of topics, a variety of beats, and a veritable crew of featuring artists, it's an album any Trip fan shouldn't miss. Yet for those more choosy or cash-strapped customers out there, who wonder if this album is worth their hard-earned and few-and-far-between dollars, I've taken an (admittedly exhaustively long) look at the album, giving an honest assessment of the album's strong tracks and - yes, they do exist - weak tracks.<br /><br />First, here are some quick initial impressions (for those who don't want to read the entire review):<br />* Don't be deceived by single \""Robot\"". That style doesn't reflect the album's feel in the slightest - it feels ripped from an entirely different album. If you loved the song... odds are you will still like this album. If you hated the song (like me)... then don't worry! The album's much better than that!<br />* There's a pretty good lyrical consistency (the good life - the one which is ultimately best for you and most satisfying) and, as with \""Between Two Worlds\"", the album stays pretty diverse topically (touching on everything from temptation to technology addiction to standard Reach Records bangers.<br />* Speaking of which, don't expect many Reach Records bangers. Or, largely, any at all. There's \""One Sixteen\"" and (to an extent) \""I'm Good\"" and \""Robot\"", but that's as close as you'll come here. This album is slower and far more chill than past albums, especially after the upbeat \""Between Two Worlds\"" (which gave us such songs as \""No Worries,\"" \""Twisted,\"" \""Covenant Eyes,\"" and \""Snitch\""). Yet, coming from someone who typically doesn't enjoy slow stuff, this album is still amazing. If slow stuff isn't your thing, still give it a try.<br /><br />And now, a more detailed song-by-song analysis:<br />NEW DREAMS (FEAT J.R. AND SHO BARAKA) - Trip's back! Huzzah! Seriously, hearing his flow on this track gets me excited every time. The lyricalcontent is typical Trip - praising God - which is always relevant, if a little been-there, done-that. That said, if it's \""been there\"" before, it hasn't been done as well as it has here. Intriguingly, the song is not a true \""Intro song\"" as is so typical on these Christian rap albums, carrying on in the vein of \""Between Two Worlds\"" (which opened with \""Real Life Music\""); it's to no detriment to the album, though, as the theme is articulated clearly elsewhere. Sho Baraka's guest verse and J.R.'s melodic chorus are good additions. This one seems like it'll get better with further listens, but my first impression of the song? 4.5/5.<br />ROBOT - First single. First song released from the album. Also, least favorite song on the album. Easily. Some people like this song (my best friend, for one), but for me personally, it's repetitive and annoying before the first listen of the song is even done, and I actively disliked the song when I first heard it. The lyrical content is okay, but highly predictable and the metaphor gets old soon. Thankfully, it grows on you *a little* (Stockholm syndrome, perhaps?), but it's still a weak song. 2.5/5.<br />I'M GOOD (FEAT LECRAE) - Okay, Lecrae and Trip on any song is going to be good, but this song is almost certainly headed for Christian Hip Hop legendary status alongside songs like \""Don't Waste Your Life\"" and \""Joyful Noise\"". The lyrical content is top-notch - no surprise, given these two, but especially true after Lecrae and Trip originally wrote one song for the album, then scrapped it, deciding it was \""just good\"" and challenged themselves to write this. The beat is creative and a branch-out for Reach, and the hook is solid, albeit not incredibly catchy. 5/5.<br />WAR - A bit strange, what with the chipmunk-sounding hook \""This is war,\"" but a pretty pleasant song overall. Some nice R&B-style melodies in the chorus contribute to a very chill song for its provocative title. The chorus is nice - \""When life and death go to battle, ain't notellin' what'll happen\"" - and the song gets more exciting when Trip's voice carries urgency in the final verse, warning listeners of Hell. That said, this song is somewhat forgettable in the grand scheme of the album; merely being `nice' won't cut it on an album of this caliber. 4/5.<br />FALLIN' - Wow. As a teenage guy who can struggle with lust, this song hit me square in the gut. The song is talking about temptation, with Trip masterfully illustrating the process that takes one to the point of \""falling,\"" with the chorus handled by the very capable J. Paul. I'm also a sucker for how the chorus words change to become hopeful in the final chorus, giving everyone a point to aspire to after facing their own sin. Furthermore, unlike past `temptation' song \""Covenant Eyes,\"" the song can be applied to any situation, not just guys lusting after girls. The song is beautiful while also convicting, and is one of my favorite songs on the entire album. 5/5.<br />ILOVE - It's a very clever song, as Trip compares his technological device to a girl, illustrating the real dangers of technological addiction through metaphor far better than a direct approach ever could (are you paying attention, \""Robot\""?). Slowly, the device takes control of his life and interferes with his quiet time - a very relatable narrative for anyone these days. Though it's solid musically, it's the lyrics that really shine here. 4.5/5.<br />KNOW ME - Trip's raps here are solid; however, the song seems somewhat aimless, without a clear chorus to structure the song... instead, we have a faint \""Know Me\"" echoing across the sonic landscape. This song seems like filler, neither good nor bad, which actually makes it a very weak track for such an otherwise consistently strong album. 3/5.<br />ONE SIXTEEN (FEAT KB AND ANDY MINEO) - Let me face something right away: you probably had high expectations for the song from the moment you saw this in the tracklist... a Reach banger with three strong rappers? Heck yes. Thenlet me break this to you: it's a good song, but not as good as the astronomical hype would have you believe. The verses are ridiculously good (nobody has a faster flow than Andy Mineo and KB) and they shine. But the hook? It's not very hooky; it's not catchy, not melodic, and - depending on which rapper is doing it - possibly a little jarring. Brought down a bit by the hook, the song is very good (though it does have to grow on you), but don't come in with crazy expectations or you might be disappointed. That said, it is the only true \""banger\"" on the album, so fans of that style will be thrilled. 4.5/5<br />HEART PROBLEM - \""Money, sex, and power are good\""... shocking words begin the song, drawing you in to see how Trip explains himself out of this. Here, Trip responds to criticism that he's faced, explaining that things are good or bad based on your heart... in that sense, money, sex, and power can be good if brought about by God and good motives, while they can be detrimental if your heart's in the wrong places. It's a daring message for Trip to make in a culture where it's easy to make \""spiritual points\"" by decrying the aforementioned `evils' in any scenario. In addition to the lyrics, the beats are solid, complemented by an interesting change during the bridge, and Trip's flow keeps things very interesting. A favorite. 5/5.<br />TAKE ME THERE (FEAT JIMMY NEEDHAM) - I wasn't excited for this, after being very underwhelmed by the least Needham-Lee collaboration (\""Yours to Own\"" on Between Two Worlds, one of my least favorite tracks on that great album). Thankfully, this song is better. Needham's chorus flows very well with the song, with both Trip and Jimmy driving home the point that the Christian should - and often, does - strive for Heaven. It's a joyful, vertically-focused number with a funky bridge and one of the best choruses on the album. 5/5.<br />BEAUTIFUL LIFE (FEAT V. ROSE) - Trip Lee made an abortion track. Pretty sure you never thought that topic wouldcome up when you started the album, but that said... it's pretty good. It's very sympathetic to the mom and the dad (yes, it even addresses the father's perspective, which I thought was a nice touch), while also making the pro-life argument. I think it's a pretty cool topic to take on, and I give Trip credit, but it feels less applicable to me personally. Also, I'm not a huge V. Rose fan personally... she's nice, but doesn't do much for me. Thus, I give this song a lower *personal* score than you might, but your mileage may vary greatly. 3.5/5.<br />FANTASY (FEAT SUZY ROCK) - Like 19th Century philosophers, Trip ponders \""what is reality?\"" on this track with the always-excellent Suzy Rock. Trip gets back to the idea of the \""good life\"" strongly here, after digressing for a few songs, explaining that people change an unattainable fantasy that ultimately can't satisfy them. It's a cautionary song against chasing the tangible things of this world. Ultimately, Trip explains that Jesus is the only thing which can fill the void in our soul, that He is the true reality. Very chill. 4/5.<br />LOVE ON DISPLAY (FEAT ANDY MINEO) - The inevitable Andy Mineo / C-Lite song on every Reach Records album, and his inclusion is always anticipated, for good reason: this time, it's his vaguely haunting \""Hallelujah\"" that sells the Christ-oriented chorus. Incredibly, this may be the one time on the album that the chorus actually outshines the verses, an impressive feat when you have a lyricist like Trip at the A-game we see here. Perhaps a little smooth vocal-heavy for some, with too little rap, but I like that sort of thing. 4.5/5.<br />FOR MY GOOD (FEAT JAI) - ...And now for something completely different. Seriously, this and \""Robot\"" are seriously jarring on such a chill, generally dance beat-free album; thankfully, this song is much better than \""Robot.\"" The sound is similar to the (also Jai-featuring) song \""God is Enough\"" off Lecrae's album \""Rehab\"" (though this song seems slightly lesserin quality, and the chorus vaguely derivative). I could see the song potentially growing old with repetition, but on first impressions it's a solid track that provides some diversity to the album, even if it doesn't fit neatly. 4/5.<br />GOOD THING (FEAT LEA SMITH) - The brass instruments finally make their appearance on the album, surprisingly confined to only one song after enjoying a prominent position on past albums (\""Snitch,\"" \""I Love Music,\"" basically all of the first 2 albums...). As far as the song itself goes? Trip's verses are solid, rapping about his good marriage to his wife. This song runs into the same issue as \""Beautiful Life\""... Lea Smith's vocals just aren't doing much for me, and it's not very relevant to a college kid like me (sorry!). Others may appreciate the song more than I do, for these reasons. In spite of these flaws, though, I like it more than \""Beautiful Life\"" due to its creative, dynamic musical arrangement and stronger hook. Maybe I'm just a sucker for finale songs. Either way: 4/5.<br /><br />I understand that looking over these numbers, you could call me a fanboy, giving incredible but ultimately unjustified scores (More than half of the album is \""5\"" or \""4.5\""). However, I would respond by saying that you can refute this with one look at any of my other reviews: even if I love a band, I can give tough scores to their individual songs; it's just a testament to this album that I never had to (\""Robot\"" excepted... we're going to forget that one ever happened, okay?). If you can't download the entire album - and you really should - at least do yourself the favor of downloading \""I'm Good,\"" \""Fallin',\"" \""Take Me There,\"" \""Heart Problem,\"" and - if you're a sucker for bangers - \""One Sixteen\"".<br /><br />This album is Trip Lee's greatest album to date, and deserves to be heard. While it's a little frontloaded, with most of the great songs found on the first two-thirds of the album, and it's got some clunkers (looking at you, \""Robot\""!), it still hasa general level of consistency that's hard to find today. Don't miss this gem of an album, which is very good indeed. 4.5/5.",2012-04-10,2087,extra_long,2012-04,music

However, the book is not without its' fair share of flaws. Namely, when attempting to apply Jane Austen's advice to our modern-day lives, she rather skirts around the issue of the differences in morailty of Jane Austen's day and our own. She does allude to it throughout the book, but appears unwilling to commit either way on whether Jane Austen had it right or if we should accept some mildly altered modern version of morality between the sexes. She clearly seems uncomfortable with the subject and appears to waffle about, without landing on any clear idea on the matter. This is rather odd and I think weakens the quality of the book, given that the point of the book is to apply Austen's ideas and principles to our modern-day lives.<br /><br />Secondly, the near constant decrying of Victorian authors (she unceremoniously throws Charles Dickens under the bus) and the time period itself is both annoying and overstated. No doubt the age had its' fair share of flaws, but the worn-out cliches Kantor repetitively uses does a disservice to an age that was much more complicated than she presents it to be. What is worse, she should know better. For someone who displays an excellent grasp of the Regency works and time period, as well as the affects of Romanticism on modern-day culture, one would think she would apply more diligence in the study of the Victorian age. At the very least, she could avoid the tired cliches that any person on the street would make.<br /><br />Notwithstanding these two glaring faults, the rest of the book contains some solid, common-sense advice. Advice that if followed in the right way, would most likely lead to very happy marriages.<br /><br />Taking everything into consideration (both the good and the bad in the book) I would give it an average to slightly-above average rating.",2012-07-08,340,long,2012-07,ebooks

Alas, I will not be joining that group.  Watching this film in early 2012 I was confronted with a depiction that  was overtly jingoistic and so fawning towards the US Navy, that I found  the preening gestures to be detracting, robbing the story of any  possible objectivity in the story telling. While I am not unaware that  every film will mirror the times in which it is crafted, I found the  musical score to be mediocre and too strenuously fixated with  reproducing a gallant and martial atmosphere. Subtlety this film had  none. Some critics have noted and I will agree with them that the first  half of the film really drags. I also feel that the romantic  peregrinations of Ensign Willie Keith are unnecessary, weakly depicted  and developed. Watching it now made me cringe, with the watered down  tension of his divided loyalties towards his mother and the woman he  asserts he is in love with just comes across as unconvincing, drained  of real passion, conviction and angst. It doesn't help the movie that  the two actors playing the roles had practically no sparks between  them. That entire part of the film, even if it is in the book, could  have been left out.  My impression of Bogart as the mentally unhinged Captain was that he  was miscast for this role. Bogey, for me at least, was too wooden,  stiff, an obvious land lubber trying to make himself look like a  seasoned sea dog and I didn't buy it for a moment. I kept on waiting  for him to pop a cigarette in his mouth but not once is he seen  smoking, which, as hilarious as it might sound from a health point of  view, was his trade mark in so many of his films. Another thing I was  quite surprised at was how short he was. Every time he stood beside Van  Johnson or Fred MacMurray, both quite tall men, Bogey look so much  smaller, which of course he was.  Much has been made of his recourse to fidgeting with with balls of some  metal, and even if it is in the novel, the way he acts this out looks  contrived and with no subtly. Imagine if it was Charles Laughton  portraying this captain as he had on the film \""Mutiny on the Bounty\""?  Bogart's Captain is portrayed more as someone who is severely anal  retentive, given to ridiculous attention to details that have about as  much place on a minesweeper as they would on a chain gang. That type of  spit and polish with harsh consequences for insubordination belonged on  a big battle ship, not a rusting hulk.  I found the emotional projections of every single person in the film to  be too cautious, unnatural, forced, self conscious of being an \""act\"".  Fred MacMurray, a talented actor, hardly breaks away from his  monochromatic portrayal, and strangely so. The only person in the film  who evoked a few moments of real emotion was Jose Ferrer, whose  sneering revulsion for the defendants is a welcome jolt of a real  moment of conviction.  A word about special effects and stock footage. The film used three  sources to show the boats. One was shot either on a stage or on a real  boat, another was stock footage from WW2 and the weakest was the model  ship being shot in a large tub. The model scenes looked at today will  only make you laugh. I suppose that in 1954 people didn't much care if  the ship looked like a toy; they focused on the overall story. I am  someone grown accustomed to quality effects and looked at now, the  storm tossed boat looks silly and amateurish.   The premise of the drama is not impossible to conjure but I felt that  it lacked enough life and death held in the balance to convince me.  Bogart's reaction to seeing the mutinous defendants outside the court  room was typical of how odd the relationships were. He was not the  least bit perturbed by seeing them and he greeted them as friends. The  court room drama was the strongest part of the film and I will grantthat watching Bogart's character fall apart was the climax of the film.  However, it was a short moment in what is otherwise a rather dreary and  muted film. You would think that the actions taken in the middle of a  typhoon to save everyone on board from imminent drowning would have  evoked a stronger reaction from all concerned but you won't find it  here. I was bothered that the film does not tell you what became of  Bogart's character, Captain Queeg. All that we know is that the  defendants won their case and that Queeg lost. I found the lack of  follow through to be a weak point. All in all, the film looks very  dated, the actors all look devoid of conviction and by comparisons to  other boat films, this one is flat. Not impressed. Go and look at what  Laughton and Gable did on the other Mutiny film and then you'll see  action worth writing accolades for. Not here.",2012-01-08,880,extra_long,2012-01,videos

They polished off everything from Mass Effect 2 making the in game experiences fast past and action packed. Weapons and armor can be altered to fit your play stile. The weapons load out is the biggest improvement with all weapons being available to all classes. The character interaction is grate with several moments where you enjoy just chilling with friends. The game truly makes you feel the over whelming odds that are stacked up as the Reapers take over the Galaxy. The soundtrack is spot on and flawless. I loved multiplayer and though it was well integrated into the game. From the start your on the edge of your set wondering how everyone will everything will play out.<br /><br />The bad: The last 10 minutes. There are several miss opportunities in this game. They didn't have a system like in the end of Mass Effect 2 where squad mates could be sent out to do other objectives. Instead they barely do anything in the climax. There's no vehicular combat to speak of witch is also a wast. Biggest miss opportunity was that there is no finally boss battle at the end. I could look past that if it wasn't for how it ended. The end is filled with plot holes that would make any one cringe. It is a slap in the face to anyone who played the last two games expecting their chooses to have ramifications.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's a great game. It could have been a true 10 out of 10 if it wasn't for the bad ending. a vast majority of the people who have bet the game say that the ending is horrible. I agree with them. Anyone who hasn't gotten it yet, I would recommend waiting until they come out with DLC or a patch that changes the ending.

US,28213322,R276UU0V8PQLPM,B008VFUQX2,630522925,Legends of Pegasus [Online Game Code],Digital_Video_Games,1,7,9,False,False,Disastrous Release,"After months of waiting, we manage to finally get our grubby little hands on Novacore's  latest release: Legends of Pegasus. For those of you unfamiliar with the game, it's essentially a space combat game  set in a 4X environment. The game boast a realistic and immersive universe featuring a unique blend of turn-based and RTS mechanics. We are big fans of the 4X games including Endless Space, SoTSE and of course, our all time favorite Galactic Civilization. With that being said, you can imagine how giddy we were with excitement when we got a chance to play and review Legends of Pegasus. On the surface, the game has a lot of nice features including a snazzy 3D rendering engine, solid graphics and the use of massive ship customization for realistic ship animations and other effects. While the game boast some innovative new features like realistic 4X gameplay, smooth comic book style cutscenes and an intricate economic and researching system, none of these tie particular well due in large part to several glaring problems: the game seems prone to unexpected crashes, freezing and game stopping bugs. I know the recent patches have remedied some of the CTD, but it still occurs and on frequent basis.<br /><br />Once you get past the crashing and random freezes, other problems seem to pop up unexpectedly. One issue I have with the game are mostly AI and gameplay flaws. Clicking on your ships and ordering them to attack an enemy frigate is an exercise in frustration. Often times, your ships will just stand idly by immune to any instructions you've given them; or they will head off towards a different path in the universe entirely only to be stuck between planets or other structures in a endless loop. When they do manage to obey your click commands, they frequently lose interest and just stand around staring at their hulls. Oftentimes, you'll think that even the ship commanders in this game would rather be doing something else; and after a while of futile clicking, I found myself supporting the mentality of the ship commanders and just wanting to hit Escape and Quit and end the misery. There are so many flaws and bugs that the Animal Planet can devote an entire series of programs just from this game alone. Again, the recent patches have corrected some of these issues, but not all of them. The occasional dumb AI is still there and the core mechanics and gameplay are still maddeningly inconsistent and frustrating.<br /><br />There are also some unforgiving glitches like ships not defending themselves when being attacked, enemy frigates taking down a whole squad of heavily armed ships just to name a few. The graphics are great - if the camera allowed us to remain zoomed in when we wanted; often times, the camera will act like it's possessed by something and mysteriously go berserk across the screen. Textures are serviceable if you enjoy blurry messes of blobs  especially when units are stacked upon each other. There are also detection and collision issues as ships will pass through each other as well as go through planets. Then there are the tangible anomalies in the game like the truncated text / mission boxes that prevents the player from figuring out what to do next, the missing waypoints, the lack of tool tip information and the random placeholders graphics scattered within the game. It's like the developers wanted to create something useful with these placeholders then figuring out it wouldn't work and scrapped the whole idea altogether. Unfortunately, they forgot to remove it, leaving the player to figure out the use and purpose of the those said items. Quite honestly, I was expecting a completely playable and enjoyable game after all the hype Kalypso and Novacore were dishing out at this years E3. But instead of getting Beyonce in a bikini - we get Oprah Winfrey in a thong. Yuck....!<br /><br />The new economic system works fairly well as you need to balance production and output from your basic stable of units to maximize the outcome to properly satisfy the needs of your population. Colonization, taxes and trade are the main drivers for building, establishing and sustaining maximum growth. Unfortunately, not everything works or seems to work as intended; something as simple as colonizing a planet still doesn't function the way it should and there's no way (at least I couldn't figure it out) to tell what your population needs are. Sometimes, you have no choice but to spam click the build que and scrape certain ships only to rebuild them and start over. It's not a complex system; or at least it shouldn't be - but it should have been more intuitive to figure out (that's where the Tool Tips would have come in handy).<br /><br />The game supports single player and MP components but as of writing, the MP is still unplayable. Matches I have found have either been non-existent as to be unplayable or it simply crashes me back to desktop. We tried playing MP here at the office but the results were a constant  'Connection Error' on the screen. Often times, you'll get a good game going only to have it freeze on you - resorting to a hard reboot of the system. I highly recommend finishing the single player campaign mode first until they iron out MP. Unless of course, you crash or get kicked back to windows.<br /><br />Granted, the developers and publisher have promised to continue supporting Legends of Pegasus with weekly patches and bug fixes which will add more polish and refinement to the game over the next several months. Still, I can't fathom the game being released in such an unfinished state. Unless you're the type of gamer that will endure anything to complete a game, I don't see how anyone can grind through this mess even half-way through. Believe me, I had to play all the way to the end - and by the time I finished the game, I was shaking and sweating like Jessica Simpson taking the SATs! it was that frustrating! Until then I would not recommend this game unless you're a avid 4X player or just enjoy getting frustrated.",2012-08-16,1036,extra_long,2012-08,games

Soon he was making guest appearances in other opera house, replacing Walter Kirchoff at short notice in Berlin in 1915 in Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos under the composer's baton; his first appearance at the Vienna State Opera came in 1920, while he was guesting at the Volksoper. Piccaver was sick, and Tauber was called upon to replace him in La Boheme, opposite Lotte Lehmann and Lotte Schoene. He was such a success that he was soon invited back and in 1922 offered a regular contract, in accepting which he incurred the wrath of the Dresden Opera. They forgave him when in 1926 he stepped in again at short notice to create Calaf in the German premiere of Turandot.<br /><br />Tauber's forte was Mozart, long before he became associated with Lehar and the world of operetta. He was considered the finest Don Ottavio, Belmonte and Tamino of the inter-war years: but he eventually sang more than 100 roles on stage, many of them in now-forgotten works, and 60 of these in Dresden. He began recording for Odeon in 1919, and made records every year right up to 1947, by then suffering from the lung cancer which killed him a few months later.<br /><br />This set of Preiser CDs contains all the published operatic selections - arias and duets - he recorded by the acoustic process between 1919 and 1926. His colleagues here include Lotte Lehmann, Elisabeth Rethberg, Sabine Kalter and Emmy Bettendorf. In addition to Mozart, we hear him in works by Kienzl, Bizet, Flotow, Tchaikovsky, Wagner, Verdi and Puccini. The transfers are excellent and all are correctly pitched, including the Singer's Aria from Rosenkavalier and Lionel's aria from Marta, both of which he recorded a step down from score pitch. They confirm his reputation as a vibrant, musical singer of impeccable technique and exuberant energy - one of the most beloved tenors of his age, and rightly so.

It only took two sentences for me to know I would love this book.  I feel like I need to give a little background info about myself in order to write this review how I want to.<br /><br />Growing up in my house was not pleasant. My childhood was no where near as severe as Katelyn and Kevin's. Where they dealt with physical abuse, and a mother who was obviously sick in the head; we dealt more with verbal abuse and neglect, with parents who put their booze, drugs, and partying first. Guys, I talk about it sometimes. I mention various stories in comments on blogs. I feel a little shaky actually discussing it here on my book blog honestly. Joking around and telling funny drunken stories are one thing, but none of what I mention in this review will be funny. I still have a distant relationship with my parents and so does my younger brother. It's a strained one though. It's like a cracked sheet of hovering glass between us, one wrong move and it shatters all over again. It's a relationship I maintain, for the simple purpose that it's less drama than the alternative. I know, this is supposed to be a review of a book, not a life dumping confession. I just wanted you all to get a feel of exactly why this book touched me so much.<br /><br />\""The only think she and I have in common, except for the obvious mother-daughter thing, was a deep love of reading\""- Katelyn &lt;---- THIS. I want to bottle this up, I have never in my life come across a quote that describes my mother-daughter relationship so well. We will never see eye to eye on, well anything really, but my love of reading stems from her.<br /><br />Katelyn's mother makes mine look like a saint. She has some serious issues. Her verbal abuse of Katelyn was painful to read. The physical was too, but the verbal is what brought up the worst for me. Some of the things she said... I have had heard the same words thrown my way for no apparent reason. Unlike Katelyn's mother, mine was always drunk when this happened, but at the end of the day, there is never a good excuse. So when Katelyn says she prefers the verbal abuse, that it's not all bad... wow, I burst into tears.<br />Because I know how bad that is... so I can't imagine welcoming that over something else. I seriously hurt's my heart to think about it.<br /><br />So many things, little things, reminded me of growing up. Katelyn has to wait hand and foot on her mother. Clean, cook, take care of her brother, empty the ashtray. *sigh* Did I mention how hard this book was for me to read? I wanted to put it down at points, I could barely see the words, but I couldn't. I had to keep reading.<br /><br />Semi settled into a trailer park, Katelyn continues on, taking care of her brother, trying not to get attached to anyone knowing it's only a matter of time before they up and leave again.  It doesn't work out for her though, because in steps Max. Gosh I loved Max and his family. Hell, practically the whole town. The support system Katelyn and Kevin have needed all their lives. Some would say it's unrealistic how everyone steps up and is so kind to help, but guys, I've witnessed this first hand. Don't be grossed out now, but my mother would only buy me feminine supplies when she was feeling generous. I was told to roll up paper towels. My friend's mom across the street would buy me a box every month and have it waiting for me. Its little things like this I'm forever grateful for. It doesn't seem like much, but it meant the world to me.

Got to about 50% before I decided I'd had enough.  The book was just toooooo long.  The characters are a touch unbelievable.  The situation kind of silly.  And some of the plot points completely predictable.<br /><br />The first chapter of this book was so amateurishly written that I thought I was reading a first attempt for a highschool english class.  The way the author describes the participating characters is almost point for point out of a intro to creative writing class.  Nod to the other chapters though, they where much better written stylewise.<br /><br />From what I understood of this universe, humanity has evolved independently of each other on countless other worlds.  With only slight genetic variations.<br /><br />The two main characters are both human, members of the opposite sex, single, and going through a stressful adventure together.  Oh look a match up you can see coming from the instant the male character is introduced.<br /><br />Their mission is to reach a convientantly inconvientantly placed beacon that will signal a rescure ship to pick them up.  All they have to do is avoid the slavers that want to recapture them.  Think about that for a moment.  Two aliens have to cross half a planet and blend into the population to avoid capture.  I can only imagine that would be as easy as a wookie trying to cross a new york city unnoticed.<br /><br />But never fear the male character is a peace officer of the federation.  Except he's a pacifist.  Could probably have solved their 'being chased across the planet' problem with a few choice blaster shots, but noooo.  Killing slavers, bent on torturing and then killing you, would be wrong.  When they escape from the ship they take advantage of a good portion of the crew being away picking up cargo.  Just offing a couple of the remaing crew and performing an amistad is apparently morally wrong and therefore an unacceptable choice.<br /><br />Along with the pacifist/idiot wussytheme is the preachy enviromental themes.  The drowned world had it's polar ice caps melted by rampant pollution and now the population has seen the light and have vowed never to use the evil fossil fuels again.  Yeah I get it.  allegory to earth.  Don't beat the horse to death with it.<br /><br />Along for the ride with these two is a street rat they have apparently adopted, because being chased by murderous interstellar criminals is such a child safe enviroment.  And a slightly bloodthirsty wedge of sentient alien brain matter implanted below the ear of it's host.  Personally I think the symbiote was under utilized.  As a character it was a great idea, but it had hardly any dialogue compared to the other characters.  Even the kid was more talkative and he didn't have several life times of experience to impart.<br /><br />And speaking of under utiliziation.  Kati is apparently a psychic.  Having that bit of alien brain matter in her head was supposed ot have increased her abilities as well.  Me, personally, I'd be test driving that sucker out.  Reading minds, predicting the future, telekenisis, any of these abilities would be extremely usefull in avoiding capture but she hardly ever uses them.

Having used the old 3D Home Architect program this one was easy to learn but FAR more powerful. My wife loves being able to switch colors and materials in the camera views and we actually used that feature in deciding on cabinets for the kitchen.<br /><br />I have only two disappointment and two are similar to what I didn't like with the 3D Home Architect. First, unless I'm missing something I have not figured out how, or if, you can produce true exterior elevation drawings to use for submitting plans for permitting and building. Second is that I have not been able to place posts how and where I want them for holding up the part of the roof that covers the porch areas. A \""place post\"" function that would allow you to put it where you want to and then specify size, etc. would be very helpful and I find it odd that with all the sophistication of the program I haven't been able to do that. I can specify posts and railings, or lack of railings, but can't specify spacing or locations, or eliminate ones that aren't needed.<br /><br />The other thing I have run into that I find irritating is that at times it can be difficult to move walls small amount to correct to even rather than odd inches or make other small adjustments. It tends to want to move the entire width of that wall as a minimum. Sometimes I can just move the wall a couple feet and then move it back in to where I actually want it but that doesn't always work and sometimes means having to move cabinets or other things out of the way to do that. I have a couple dimensions on the plans I am doing now that I will have to correct by hand because I just can't get them to adjust.<br /><br />Overall though this is a great product for the money.",2012-07-27,333,long,2012-07,software

Due to the fact that the game is no longer fun i turned to other MMO's. The only other one that I could find that came close to detail and Beauty of GW2 was Rift. The problem with Rift is that no one really plays it so dungeon ques where over an hour long and there wasnt a real community feel to it. GW2 is by far, the most stunning graphical MMO I have played. The mechanics that power the attacks are far different from any other MMO I have played as the majority of your skills your toon uses is just that, skill. Your characters ability to over come an enemy is not by how good your spell rotation is, it relies on how well you can use your character, dodge is by your ability to dodge an attack and not by just how much stat you have, parry is achieved by actually parrying an attack with your sword and shield (yes you can actually use your shield).<br /><br />Something else that has always been an issue with lots of people playing at the same time on a MMO is that questing is competing against one another for items and kills on certain creatures. Well, GW2 has a beautiful solution to that by having world events where players work with each other to accomplish a quest. Loot is shared so as long as you attacked that creature, you will get a share of the loot. and kills can be earned by all who helped defeat that creature. Questing has never been more fun nor easier as you do not have to hunt down people to get a quest from there, if you happen to be in the area of the quest, it automatically allows you to start partaking in that quest even if it has already started!<br /><br />This game in my opinion has a lot going for it, especially since there are NO monthly fees is a MMO that i plan to stick with.",2012-09-04,361,long,2012-09,games

Sadly Chess was a fantastic musical that slid under the radar for most people, including myself, save for a singular popular hit, 'One Night In Bangkok'.  I have the fortune (misfortune?) of being around when 'One Night In Bangkok' climbed the pop charts and was thrilled to hear Murry Head once again rise to prominence with his power and passion. It wasn't until many years later, though, that I was exposed to the remainder of the soundtrack only to realize what a great production I had missed.  Needless to say, I was quite excited to see that there was a video production of this musical featuring such talented modern artists as Edina Menzel (Wicked/Rent), and Adam Pascal(Rent).<br /><br />Sadly the video looks like it was made for an Atari 2600. Forget seeing freckles or makeup lines, you'll be lucky if you can make out the performers.  While the performances are passible, they don't measure up to the original or even my expectations of the artists. While technically good, the presentation of the production as an oratorio somehow fails to convey any sense of emotion that might have been present in the orignal stage production.<br /><br />I unfortunately never had an opportunity to see the original, but the music in the video often sounds more like a vocal exercise than a theatrical production.  I can almost hear someone saying \""Hey, let's do Chess, won't it be fun? Maybe we can squeeze it into our schedules.\""  I think the cold war passion and intrigue that was the foundation for this musical got lost somewhere between line 1 and line 2 of the lyrics.<br /><br />If I close my eyes, it's worth the $11-$12 I paid for the virtual copy, but beyond that I'd recommend buying the original cast recording for $24. If you have money to burn after that and haven't bought video copies of the stage productions of Les Miserables, or Phantom of theOpera, then by all means give it a shot, just turn off the television.<br /><br />There is one consolation and that is that if this copy made it to video, that there's some hope of me seeing Alan Cumming and Cyndi Lauper in Kurt Weil's 'The Three Penny Opera'.

It is a thoughtful engagement with life befitting a Christian artist. Truth and grace, struggle and hope are expressed in subtle but rewarding ways. Some of these treasures were gained in the darkness, which gives them more luster. The excellence found throughout adds to the beauty and makes this a pleasure to hear.<br /><br />Godsey deserves credit for great writing, which includes a few co-writes. She also gets the best possible support with musicians like Jerry McPherson, Blair Masters and Chris Donohue, studio players with long resumes. It helps too when you have Scott and Christine Dente of Out of the Grey and Chris Rodriquez singing background vocals. Scott Dente also plays acoustic guitar and shares the producer credit with Ken Lewis. Together they are known as Global Genius Productions.<br /><br />The concept of story played a part in this release. In the fall of 2009, Godsey and her husband Jake read Donald Miller's A Thousand Miles in a Million Years, which suggests that the elements in a great story also make for a well-lived life. Overcoming adversity to attain something is a familiar theme in the best dramas. Thankful for their comfortable life, but challenged by Miller's thoughts, Godsey and her husband began praying for opportunities to live a better story not knowing what would come. A series of circumstances reinforced her calling to music but it also included a time of sickness, suffering and loss. It's where lines like the following in \""How to Be Thankful\"" come from: \""Before I go to face my father's graves oh I pray ... Your storms would stay ... till they take what they came for ... take what You came for ... is this what you came for ... well take what you came for.\"" That maturity, which wants God to accomplish His purpose in the storm, informs the lyrics on this release.<br /><br />The same confidence is found in the music. The opening \""White Page\"" with its warm piano notes and snappy production sounds like a Top 40 song. It was the fourth track, \""Daylight,\"" that took me by surprise.

I took it to the beach with me to read on vacation and was thoroughly disappointed. I tried really hard to like the book, but it was very difficult. The thing that really got me the most is that Follett said in the foreword that he did not believe in God. As a former agnostic, I have to say I'm just not interested in reading about hypocrisy in the church. Yes, people of faith are sinners and do engage in evil deeds from time to time. But this is the same old tired ideas people in modern society have been throwing around for decades and it is such a bore! Finding fault with people of faith is such an easy form of escape. Take responsibility for your own behaviors and stop blaming others who are just human and, yes, sinners.<br /><br />Scapegoating religious leaders aside,the other reason I could not get past this book is the characters and the plot. The leading character loses his wife tragically (or perhaps conveniently) during childbirth and that night is rescued by a beautiful young women he had eyes for earlier in the book. The rescue, ironically, involves her lying down naked with him and saving him from freezing to death by making love to him. This was just way too obvious and predictable. No depth whatsoever. Guess I should have just stopped at the foreword but I wanted to give him the benefit of doubt.

Unfortunately, Assassin's Creed 3 falls short in pretty much every department. It's not a bad game, and there are a handful of positive additions... but it's a little pathetic to see it fail to meet the standards set even by AC2's expansion games.<br /><br />The biggest flaw is definitely that the game feels woefully untested. AC3 on the PC has a ridiculous number of bugs, from epileptic horses to menu freezes that make it impossible to proceed, and I've been encountering them in virtually every mission and quite often while just running around. There are also a lot of bewildering things that somehow made it past playtesting; I was killing bears with a hidden blade that was apparently coming out of my bare arm for quite a while before the plot got around to letting me have it, and at one point I was wandering around and completely by accident captured a British Templar fort, which replaced the flag and all the troops there with American revolutionaries... in 1770. In-game tooltips display at very weird moments, like a prompt telling you how to lower your notoriety at a time in the game when none of the methods described are available to you, and every cinematic has a prompt saying \""PRESS E TO SKIP\"" plastered across the corner for the duration. It's not just software bugs, basically - this game feels like it was never tested.<br /><br />That extends to the writing, too. I'm not far in enough to make a definitive statement about the plot, but it looks like the story level is still reasonably in line with the series' quality so far... but the script is just horrific. Scenes just drag on, especially in the very beginning, with voice actors doing their best with lines like \""what's true and what is aren't always the same.\"" And it's not just dialog that's a problem,either; the story structure and pacing are badly out of whack. We're given no reason to care about any of the characters until several missions into the game, and when we do finally meet our protagonist, our introduction to him is watching several scenes of mediocre voice actors monotone their way through extremely lengthy speeches in Mohawk. (I can't express how bad the Mohawk acting is, it's literally like hearing someone reading a technical manual.)<br /><br />Gameplay itself isn't nearly so problematic, but still suffers badly from a lack of thorough testing. The developers made a big deal about the ability to pick up weapons on the fly, but I had trouble picking them up even standing completely still with no enemies around. The new lockpicking minigame is a perfect storm of unnecessary, no fun and unreasonably picky about precise mouse movement. I had problems constantly with getting stuck on the end of beams unable to move forward, having to realign to the precise right angle to climb certain objects, and attempting to climb impassable barriers that are completely indistinguishable from climbable surfaces. Lip syncing frequently turned into muppet-style flapping with no connection whatsoever to the sound (sometimes not even opening their mouths during dialog at all). Elites deflect attacks and counterattacks pretty much 100% of the time, which makes combat pretty repetitive (counterattack grunts, disarm then attack elites... every time). Several of the optional mission objectives are almost impossible to understand unless you've already played the level once. It's just rough, basically. The difficulty is a huge mess - I had no trouble taking on entire forts simultaneously from the very beginning of the game, but failed other missions constantly thanks to pointlessly capricious layouts for stealth sequences and unpredictable cutoff points for achieving secondary objectives. Even the historical hooks are pretty lackluster, and none of the characters are particularly interesting. And it's been painfully obvious for a few installments that they didn't plan for Kristen Bell's leaving the series, and they've made no effort whatsoever to fill the gap in the narrative left by her character. One entire component of the game (the economic/crafting system) is only usable with an XBox controller and will freeze if you so much as move the mouse. Almost everything about the game feels like a rough draft, basically.<br /><br />It's not all bad news, of course. The new naval sequences are outstanding. Graphically the game looks pretty great, and the new weather system is attractive (especially localized effects like fog). The nature areas look particularly good (and are massive!), which was a wise decision - colonial America was perhaps not the best choice for this series, considering its lack of gorgeous, huge landmark buildings to climb on, but the game seems to be making up for that by going for knockout natural environments instead. Although a lot of the previous installments' RPG elements are gone, the new hunting system is pretty engaging. Animation's enjoyed some high-quality additions too, especially the run cycle and a whole slew of fancy new combat flash. The world is enormous, there's a ton of stuff to play around with and climb on. And I actually did find a couple (non-mandatory) minigames that were surprisingly fun, where you play old-timey board games in taverns.<br /><br />Overall, though, I'd only really recommend this game to people who are already in love with the series. It does a reasonable job of bringing us more of the free-running madness that made the first several games so much fun, so it's a good buy just to give you more stuff to climb around on once Italy starts feeling a little too familiar... but it really doesn't stand up well on its own.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Excellent and exhilirating naval combat<br />-Very attractive, albeit not (ahem) revolutionary<br />-Pretty much anything you do out in the woods is great<br />-Highly cinematic combat<br />-The engine can support huge numbers of NPCs simultaneously (crowds are, well, crowded)<br />-It is still pretty fun, when everything's working<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Mediocre story editing and script, very poor story pacing<br />-Absolutely overrun with software bugs and continuity errors<br />-Combat, while beautifully choreographed, is essentially a combination of a reflex test and rock-paper-scissors<br />-Possibly the worst mandatory lockpicking minigame ever made (it's not nearly as bad with a controller, but it's maddening with a mouse, and purposeless either way)<br />-The setting is not well-suited to the more appealing gameplay elements<br />-There's a well-documented bug that completely prevents you from progressing past a certain point without an XBox controller, which wasn't fixed in the recent patches.<br />-Very, very slow first few hours",2012-11-25,1121,extra_long,2012-11,games

The character editing system from spore got carried over, but that is it.  The rest is pretty much a mediocre rpg game.  The rate you level does not keep with the difficulty from the game.  This means that you have to replay levels to gain more gear/xp, which is a grind.  The levels are pretty much linear, and there is a limited number of them.  There are no quests in the level, just certain objective, which has the goal of getting you to visit every part of the level.  So after a while there isn't all that much to look forward to.  The only new thing is heros to unlock.  You get gear drop from the levels as well, but you are also having to contantly update your gear to keep up with the levels.  So even if you get a rare item now, in a couple of levels it is worthless.  Perhaps their original intention is to get you to play with other people, since they force you to be online.  You get a litte more extra xp playing with other people, but it would still be a grind.  The game is like half dead, so there is like a high of 40 people in the lobby.  So you can't just hop in and find someone to play with right away.  Also there is no way to pause the game.  You can find a safe spot and stop, but sometimes the object is finish the level in a certain time.  So that counts against you.  They also want you to level chain (play multiple levels back to back), but that means you only get 3min in between levels before having to continue.  Perhaps if they had made it open world and added some quests it might be more fun.  Having to go through the same levels over and over with not to do but killing mobs turns into a grind real fast.  They unfortunately still have bugs.  The game somehow still has issues with video cards.  I had issues with my screen turning black if I alt+tab out of the game and came back in.  The game doesn't stop my mouse from moving out of the frame of the game and from my firstmonitor into my second.  The second I click on my second monitor is the same as an alt tab.  So my screen would be pure black, but somehow I could see the content if I brought up Origin's overlay.  Imagine the frustration when this happens to me in the middle of a level, where you can't pause.  This eventually turned out to be a problem caused by EA's Original overlay.  Fortunately if you run the game without going through origin, the overlay won't be there and the problem is gone. Bugs like this should have been fixed a long time ago, since they make the game unplayable.  There is apparently also a bug with the game and Killer network cards.",2012-02-08,511,extra_long,2012-02,games
US,14371962,R2T2CRDI89DX2Y,B0070Z4M4I,316484262,The Thing (2011),Digital_Video_Download,2,3,6,False,False,All those little THINGS like script and direction.,"Who goes there? I mean really who digs up one of the best cult classics EVER just to do nothing with it. John Carpenters 80's The Thing was his Sistine Chapel (I'm still not the same after seeing it and that was 20 years ago). He based his version off of the original book (if you don't know it look at my first sentence) not to be confused with the 50's popcorn sci-fi flick The Thing From Another World. Carpenter also played off of the cold war paranoia going on in the 80's. It was pure raw genius. This Thing based its premise off of every other pointless sci-fi horror flick. Hot female lead Check, Lots of violence Check and a monster check. Too bad that whole plot Thing missed them.<br />If you're going to re-make (actually a prequel) a movie then be bold and fresh about it. The Thing is neither of these which begs to question, who goes there? If it was to waste my time and make me think I could write (not to mention direct) a better movie than good show! Maybe I'm off base because after all they did get a quality script writer in Eric Heisserer (A Nightmare on Elms Street 2008 & Final Destination 5). Opps my bad I guess they didn't. Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. direction was a white out void of emotion. His biggest fail was not creating that feeling that the walls were closing in on our cast.<br />The only reason to bring the Thing to the screen again would've been to give the audience another portion of what they loved about the original. This flick failed to flesh out the everyman for himself paranoia. There were no moments that were so revolting that you simply couldn't look away. It was more jack in a box scares than a total freak show that messed with your mind. The only thing messed up about The Thing prequel was how bad they messed it up.<br /><br />Acting (Ambivalent): The acting wasn't horrid. It's just none of characters were really engrossing. This was mostly due to a rushed script that gave no depth to rich characters. They traded depth of a few characters for plenty of back ground characters. Most of whom lacked a pulse. Once the killing starts it turns into, oh that guy died who was he again? Plus most emotional scenes lacked a proper response from the surrounding characters. E.g. tons of serious drama is going down around me but I'll just follow orders as if it all hasn't quite registered yet. Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) the lead scientist was poorly fleshed out and came across stale. Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) played the now overdone heroine (ever since Aliens every sci-fi horror movie does this, sorry Ripley was a one of kind). Her character was forced but she gave it a go and she's eh. Carter (Joel Edgerton; terrific actor in good movies) plays the American helicopter pilot hero (R.J. MacReady wannabe; if you didn't get that then shame on you) and he's also eh.<br /><br />Script (Yak): Pitch, lets remake a cult classic. We'll steal the title (I would have gone with \""Who Goes There?\"" But hey that's me) and recycle what we shouldn't from the original (you know flame throwers, blizzards and tough helicopter pilots). Oh yeah and were going to have badder fast moving monsters and a few inconceivable plot twists. Sigh... the problem with this pitch is that along the way they forgot what really mattered. What made the 80's Thing great was that feeling that the walls were closing in on you. That gut check moment of if we don't stop it here the whole world is done.<br />Also Things move way too fast (this is true no matter how you take it).<br /><br />The best parts to the script were the very very very end and very very very beginning. Their method for testing if someone was the Thing was well thought out but that's really about it. Overall it's mostly just another sci-fi slasher without the gratuitous nudity (I'm not pro nudity but B slasher flicks at least know what they are and aren't). This Thing doesn't know what it is.<br /><br />My other grip is when a movie is a prequel/sequel for a universe butthey totally don't fit in that universe (most notorious offender is George Lucas). The whole premise that an American team went to the Norwegian camp was lame. We didn't need an American female lead but most importantly we didn't need any Americans. Plus the Thing at times doesn't pounce on potential victims when it could. This made no sense other than to create that big plot twist moment.<br /><br />Special Effects (Nothing Special about Digital): Special effects in the 80's looked real (Empire, Return of the Jedi, Blade Runner, The Thing, Aliens & Terminator). I appreciate what digital effects can do but they can't do quite a lot. The Thing uses them often which really mucks up the moment by taking us out it. When a monster looks fake you stop living the scene and start to analyze how silly it looks. This NEVER happened in the original. The effects fell short because they lacked the brutal nature of actual monster props, gallons of blood and puss plus the realness of hand crafted latex creepers (When they burn they look real unlike their digital cousins).<br /><br />Music (where are you): Bum bump bum bump flat line. The heart beat music wasn't here until the last scene (I think the start also but it was brief). That's the best part of the music and it wasn't even used. Wow bad call in a movie full of bad calls.<br /><br />Fin.",2012-02-29,962,extra_long,2012-02,videos

The songs tend to be fairly predictable in development, structurally as well as musically. As such, this isn't an album that merits inspection if you're the kind of listener that have a constant need to be surprised to maintain interest in any given record.<br /><br />While listening through this disc my associations mainly stuck to a handful or so of artists whose material should be familiar to most. Styx and Rush most commonly, and for some reason or other Triumph was a band name that kept popping up in my mind when listening to this production too. On a select few occasions the material incorporates something of a Pink Floyd vibe too, and on one occasion Tangerine Dream was a bad that came to mind too. But mostly the material made me think about the first two artsts mentioned, and for the latter of these their late 80's period forst and foremost.<br /><br />The compositions themselves are fairly pleasant acqaintances throughout. The majority of them are dominated by vocal sequences, and while Carpenter's voice is a distinct one that won't have a universal appeal it is always a pleasant surprise to encounter a vocalist that is actually a good singer and know how to utilize his range and delivery to emphasize his strengths in that department. He comes across as a decent instrumentalist too, although I'll have to admit that the drums came across as somewhat less interesting. Nota key factor for the majority of listeners I suspect, but those who desire a few bells and whistles in that department will have to cope with the nice and steady approach on this particular album.<br /><br />Apart from that I found the more ballad oriented pieces to be somewhat less intriguing than the harder edged material. Material of a calmer and gentle nature are hard to create in a manner that makes them stand out from the plethora of similar material that has been made, and in this case I didn't find them to be substantially different or more interesting than the majority of ballads around. With one exception, the slightly Floydian tinged Creature of the Night. A piece with a strong and distinct atmosphere that gives rise to associations towards the dark and the night in an intriguingly pleasant and easygoing manner.<br /><br />The harder edged material obviously made more of an impact on me personally. With cleverly constructed themes pairing off darker toned guitars with wandering piano motifs and a mostly subdued symphonic backdrop as key features for the songs of this kind as central features. Frequently with a nifty bass motif providing a distinct foundation, occasionally with bass and keyboards combining to form effective initial phases for the main themes. There's also the mostly instrumental energetic flamboyance of a piece such as Future World that merits a special mention, this particular piece a one off that sounds pretty much like the shorter material made by Tangerine Dream in the White Eagle era, with guitars added in to enhance the contrasts.<br /><br />All in all this is a pleasant production. And while it may not be found on too many lists of the best albums released in 2011 it is a disc that merits a looksie. And I'd guess that people who generally enjoy the majority of the material released by the trio of Styx, Triumph and Rush should make out something of a core audience for The Minstrel's Ghost, in particular fans of the former two of them.<br /><br />My rating: 63/100",2012-09-29,687,extra_long,2012-09,music

He seems to be the go-to guy when indie supergroups need a fourth member. He's got the gig with Zooey, as the Him to her She.

You would think he would always be in the company of some indie superstar pals or doe-eyed American Apparel model types.

He sounds alone yet content, waiting for the end of the world with an acoustic guitar in his hands.<br /><br />At his best, M. Ward creates these sonic landscapes you can easily get lost in. Melancholy, sometimes morose, but always a beautiful walk on some desolate beach. At his worst, M. Ward can sound like an indie rock Jack Johnson. Overly enamored with the musical past.

His best attributes far out weigh the worst, fortunately.<br /><br />He is at his absolute best with an acoustic guitar in his hand and beautiful melody following his words. Songs like `Clean Slate', `Wasteland Companion' and `Pure Joy' are Ward at his absolute best. Beautifully plucked acoustic, his whispered vocals and harmonies rising above the melancholy to put you in a different frame of mind. Just enough country and blues lean without putting it in straight up country territory. His production style is set firmly in that Spector `wall of sound', with Brian Wilson's knack for the 'pocket symphony' beauty. The highlight here is `The First Time I Ran Away'. Gentle acoustics and echoed \""oohs\"" with a distant pedal steel set the tone of this narrative of leaving home and the inevitable homecoming. This is the type of music M.

At one time, it was from a Nazi guard whom I only just happened to be standing near by pure chance. Perhaps I would have got that note from some other NPC if I hadn't happened to go near that Nazi - but then who knows.<br /><br />The environment was pretty well-crafted. There were spots where the terrain got spotty, especially near the edges of playable space, and there were a couple of glitchy spots, where Sean ended up trapped in some wonky geometry and I had to make him kill himself in order to get out. But for the most part it's pretty solid and doesn't feel as repetitive as a lot of open-world games.<br /><br />I found the open world free-play much more challenging than many other games of this type. Even thought the Nazis are rather dumb, they area lot more alert than I'd thought, especially when I'm in disguise. They also have a crapload of firepower and fast vehicles which are difficult to evade in the narrow Paris streets.<br /><br />Other actions such as finding the way up buildings to get to certain freeplay targets (such as scenic viewpoints) and just finding where a target might be was extremely challenging. In fact I'd submit that some of the freeplay targets were more challenging than the scripted missions. You really have to use your wits and ingenuity.<br /><br />There are a lot of resources for making an interesting freeplay experience and setting up situations that either distract or delay Nazi pursuers. Such as setting up small roadblocks using all the cars you can snag. Or simply driving right at them when they're not paying attention. Doing this, I've been able to remove the guards from several targets without even raising an alarm.<br /><br />The variability of the Nazi's alertness worked well - in some places you really have to keep alert in case you are seen, while others it seems they seem oblivious to you, but then do notice you if you make just the wrong moves. But once the Nazis do sound an alarm, getting away or getting to a hiding spot can be great, rowdy fun, which is a nice contrast to the tension of creeping along trying not to get caught.<br /><br />About the scripted missions, I felt the number and variety of them was just about right. The missions were just staggered enough to where you didn't feel like you were trapped in a one-way, linear storyline (such as in Mafia 2) but you could play the story as you saw fit, along with all the freeplay objectives. The characters and story were interesting and didn't detract much from the action.<br /><br />Now for the things I wasn't so crazy about...<br /><br />-the music was too unvaried, and some of those songs were repeated so much that they started going through my head at random times when not playing the game. Also, Ella Fitzgerald sang a lot better songs than \""Caravan.\""<br /><br />-Also about the music: Some of the songs are anachronistic. \""Feelin' Good\"" by Nina Simone was not even released until 1965. There was also a song I heard in the Cabaret headquarters, which is done by a modern group (I forgot the name). I would have liked a lot more classic 40s stuff such as Andrews Sisters, Bing Crosby, and Glen Miller.<br /><br />-American music was banned by the Germans, who considered jazz to be an inferior art form. So you wouldn't have been able to ride around playing it on your car radio (even if you'd been allowed to have a car radio at all!).That's a minor concern, but it might have made some interesting freeplay if the Nazis heard the music and got suspicious.<br /><br />-People wouldn't have been allowed to drive or walk around at night when the Nazis imposed curfews. Just getting around at night would have been another interesting and challenging freeplay opportunity if they'd enforced the curfew.<br /><br />-The dialog from random NPCs was pretty lame. Rather, it wasn't dialog so much as people walking around talking to themselves and always about the same things, no matter where you went. I got sick of hearing about \""gunfire before the bombing raid\"" Sean's random dialog was pretty dumb too. I felt the game could have done without any dialog at all unless it was made to sound more like natural conversation.<br /><br />-Nazis were not the only ones to fear during the occupation. In fact, the Vichy goverment of France itself were as fearsome as the Nazis. They just didn't have quite as much firepower. Anyway, that could have been yet another freeplay or mission opportuntiy - to somehow play the Nazis against the Vichys and vice versa.<br /><br />-The black marketeers would not have been able to operate quite so openly as in the game. However I don't quibble with that too much, as it made my dealers much easier to find!<br /><br />Overall, a good, rolicking fun game which I highly recommend if you like sandbox-type games.",2012-04-03,1069,extra_long,2012-04,games

HERE SNIPE!,"The movie starts out with a woman and child being killed and eaten by shape-shifting hyenas. The first thing you will notice is that the faces of the hyenas move about as much as a rubber mask with red lights in the eye sockets. There is a first person narration by Briggs (Maxie J. Santillan Jr.) sitting by a camp fire talking in the past tense to fill in plot points they didn't have time to film. His narration seems to have been written for Tony Todd, which they most likely couldn't afford. Crazy Briggs is able to convince Gannon (the man's who family was killed) that it was shape-shifting hyenas who did it. (In this movie we find out snipes don't really exist.) The sound track was awful as it seems to have been taken from a TV movie.<br /><br />Within a few movie time minutes they have become seasoned veterans who are now being hunted by the hyenas and they have a partner who has a BMW that won't start.

While, it was written by Rachel Carter, the story idea, the framework was created by James Frey<br /><br />James Frey. Go look up \""A million little lies\"" and you will see the controversy that has followed this guy. It was a big scandal.<br /><br />Anyway, he decided to basically create full fathom five an assembly line publishing company where he pays authors in new york around $500 to churn out a book and believe me, it is churned out. It lacks depth, characters and originality which you will see in a moment when I go into the story itself. He was the same guy who ran into trouble with the author who wrote I am number four. He then markets to publishers and film studios.<br /><br />This is a quote from one of the authors. \""Mr. Frey trolls writing classes and other writers' gathering places. Writers contracted with Full Fathom Five earn no salary and make almost no money up front (they get $250 upon signing and another $250 upon completion of a book--\""Chinese-food money,\"" one author called it). They are promised 30% to 49% of all revenue whether it comes from videogames or publications rights.\""<br /><br />Sounds good right. Not really.<br /><br />The output is a book that is basically a knock off from other books or movies.<br /><br />For instance in this book, the similarities between this and BACK TO THE FUTURE movie is hilarious!!! ( except back to the future was actually good) this book doesn't measure up.<br /><br />Please mr frey dont pitch this to the studios, back to the future has already been done and it was a hell of a lot better than this<br /><br />This book amounts to the following<br /><br />1. Girl who lives in montauk with a grandfather and family. Her grandfathers dad went missing back in the 1940s. Her grandfather keeps visiting camp hero to figure it out but does nothing except wander around in the woods.<br />2. She goes out to camp hero withher grandfather, ends up separating from him to get her top,  meets some strange kid that really no one cares about throughout the book then gets into the facility and in tons of boring lines gets into a time machine  that takes her to 1940's<br />3. The next 80% of the book is basically girl talk in the 1940s, doing up hair, dresses, a dance, meeting her grandfather as a kid, talking about nothing much except trash - basically READ a history book on the 1940s and you will get the gist, it was more 1940s history than it was a gripping novel. And ripping off back to the future parts ( like guy falling for her when he should be falling for someone else. UH can we say back to the future when martys mom falls for him )<br />4. Finally she figures out her grandfathers, father is the one heading it up but he doesnt know what is going on.<br />5. She and her guy named wes who is a total jock strap, boring and totally 1 dimensional like her and the other characters. They then tell her grandfathers father, convince him, they get caught. She gets sent back to her own time and discovers her grandfather is now missing. ( another back to the future knock off )... guess what yes book 2 will now be about her grandfather. Then book three will likely be about her dad LOL.<br /><br />Seriously the above is the book entirely, the only excitement I had was when i finished it and knew that I wouldn't have to endure another word of the UNBELIEVABLE actions this girl takes in the book ( total mary sue, falling for a guy in the first 2 chapters and doing things that 99% of girls would not do )<br /><br />They have taken what could have been a good story about montauk and defiled it with  nothing more than pages and pages of vomit enduced agony.<br /><br />No thought given to story development, character development.<br /><br />Unoriginal and probably best for the 25 cents bulk bin, where it can be used for firewood.<br /><br />I have a sneaky feeling based on James Freys track record thatthey gave the girl the story outline, and she just filled in the blanks to make it a gag fest!.<br /><br />I really hope this doesn't make it to the movie screen as it would be horrendous.... I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless you are brain dead. I don't plan on  reading book 2 or 3<br /><br />I had high hopes for this, sorry but it just didn't cut it for me",2012-10-20,799,extra_long,2012-10,ebooks

Only ten times worse,"In all the years of the X Factor, Britain's annual exploitation of the weak-minded and ignorant (and that's just the viewers), there has always been the measuring stick, the benchmark, of what Simon Cowell considers to be a STAR. And Leona Lewis, despite being as interesting and with as much personality as flat pack furniture, was that benchmark. Her voice was, and indeed is, exemplary. Perfect for the overwrought, bloated ballads that Cowell's thousand monkeys behind typewriters would churn out, eagerly lapped up by the sort of people who buy that kind of stuff. Y'know; morons.<br /><br />Time, however, has not been kind to Leona. The pop landscape has changed considerably in the last few years, and her blend of boring, witless chunder just doesn't sell in the bucket-loads that Cowell is used to. And so, in the age of Lady Gaga and Rihanna, what is a terminally bland and uninteresting girl to do?  There have been talks for more than a year now of Leona coming back with some brave, experimental new sound. That Leona had embraced dance and dubstep. The one song that has trickled out, the grindingly tedious \""Collide\"" was a dull 90's dance beat with Leona bellowing over it, and it's only redeeming factor was that it showed that dance music and Leona Lewis just don't mix.<br /><br />Anyway, that new, exciting, cutting edge album was due out in the summer of 2011. Nothing. Then promised in March 2012. Again - no show. It's now been pushed back even further to the end of 2012, where I can only assume her record label are hoping the world will end first.<br /><br />So how do you stay relevant in today's fast moving pop world AND show them how you've grown as a \""credible\"" artist? Well, Leona Lewis obviously has no idea, because she's released this EP of cover versions. And surprise surprise - they're all ballads! Who could have predicted that? Pretty much everyone, obviously. Although the sheer, striking unoriginality and lack of effort contained in this three track yawn must surely come as a surprise.<br /><br />When Trent Reznor first heard Johnny Cash's cover of Hurt, he said he felt like he'd \""lost a girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore.\"" Somehow I can't imagine him having the same sentiment about this Leona Lewis attempt; the track barely has a pulse, and Lewis, gifted singer though she may be, absolutely lacks the kind of chops required to pull this song off. Cash's cover was full of pain and regret after a lifetime of hard living. Leona is just putting on her best \""I'm sooo SAD\"" voice, and it would be quite funny if it wasn't so pathetic and ill-judged. Leona has made a bit of a career out of covering stadium rock songs. She's covered \""Run\"" by Snow Patrol and \""Stop Crying Your Heart Out\"" by Oasis in the past, creating two by the numbers, cut and paste big voice, orchestra in the background snore-ballads. This is worse than both combined; an ugly, gigantic mis-fire, and easy contender for worst cover version this century.<br /><br />The Goo Goo Dolls hit \""Iris\"" is one of THE go-to songs for pop imbeciles looking to score a hit with a rock song. Ronan Keating, atrocious boyband The Wanted, Kelly Clarkston, Taylor Swift.. if you don't know a thing about music but want to pretend you do, Iris is your cover. And Leona's version strips away most of the guitar and, well, enjoyment from the song, turning it into three of the most boring minutes of your life. I think the studio were trying for \""haunting\"", when really what they got was just plain dead. And on the third track Leona actually manages the impossible and makes you WANT to hear the Counting Crows. After all, anything's got to be better than her mind-numbing cover of \""Colourblind.\"" If you make it to the end of this EP without switching it off you've obviously been tied to a chair.<br /><br />With X Factor winners dropping from the radar at an ever increasing rate (2010's winner's third single scaled to the dizzy chart heights of 185), it was tradition to look back to Leona Lewis and how it \""should\"" be done. This truly dismal EP shows that her time is now up.<br /><br />Just go away forever, Leona.o Leona Lewis and how it \""should\"" be done.

As a new program I wouldn't recommend it all that highly either.<br /><br />I have Typing Instructor Deluxe, Version 11.  A dinosaur, huh?  My area where I often need to practice is ten key data entry; I use Typing Instructor to keep in practice.  Version 11 is excellent.  My favorite skill building Arcade game is Gone Fishing.  Version 11 lets you select all numbers, numbers and decimals, numbers with addition and subtraction, or all keys - which more realistically resemble real life data entry tasks, as well as data entry tests.  Version 11 version of Gone Fishing also tells you your key strokes per minute and your accuracy in percentages, which corresponds to the standards one has to meet in the real world.  For instance, real world data entry jobs commonly require 10,000 to 12,000 ksph and atleast 98%, sometimes 99%, accuracy, so you need to know exactly what your speed and accuracy is.<br /><br />Platinum Version 21 version of Gone Fishing lets you choose only either numbers, or all keyboard characters, in any order rather than the real world task where usually only + and - are at the end of each number as you enter it.  Actually, real world typing tests taken with employers for employment, almost never use the * and / characters, and real life on the job data entry almost never uses them, so this is a needless level of difficulty that radically slows down experienced data entry people trying to build their speed, and makes this entire program essentially useless for building ten key data entry speed.  The Viking ship race, which also builds 10 key speed, has always forced you to either practice all numbers or all characters.  THEN, the program does not tell you your speed in key strokes per minute or your rate of accuracy.  Instead you learn how many points you made and how many fish got away.  How many points you made has no meaning in key strokes per hour and accuracy rate; you don't actually know how well you did in terms of some real world employment-oriented standard.<br /><br />For building accuracy, I use Wild Wild West.  The platinum version 21 version throws out numbers or words on the screen with no seeming regard for the speed you specified, and while the point system resembles that of Typing Instructor Deluxe version 11, it seems to be less informative, perhaps partly because you've no idea what your speed really was, while the older version actually delivers the words or numbers at the rate you specify.<br /><br />The image quality of the newer version is also inferior; it is grainy.<br /><br />There seems to be nothing new or exciting about the typing practice or tests.<br /><br />Unfortunately I am highly skeptical that the makers of Typing Instructor will understand a word of this, because though they once had heads, they strongly appear to no longer have heads - or they'd not have made these particular changes.<br /><br />I highly don't suggest it.

So far, all of the functionality I needed is included in the price of the Pro software and it has really helped me organize my business tasks.  Being able to create and track all aspects of customers, estimates, invoices and payments is necessary and I think Quickbooks does a very good job of this.  This really is comprehensive software and it covers a lot of different tasks and aspects of running a small business.  Integrating things like banking and shipping, for example, helps me save time and keep things in one place.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of, is the learning curve.

They did respond the next day - from Germany - probably because my email said I thought the product was misrepresented and if they could not help me make it work I'd seek a refund from Amazon and write a review to warn others.<br /><br />Quick Summary:  We exchanged 4-5 emails because their first two short answers were totally unhelpful.  FINALLY, they directed me to a location designed to import mp3s from a hard drive.  NOT in the \""Import\"" menu, mind you, THAT step would only import different formats from a CD.  Rather, it is in a totally different location visible only in a certain mode. Ok, let's \""import\"" music files from a CD but we don't \""import\"" ??? mp3s from a hard drive.  Oh, I see.  Looked elsewhere they suggested, and wow, FOUND the right place !!!  Yea !!  So I loaded the mp3.  It shrunk from 3.5 Min to 1.1 Min.  Hitting \""play\"" produced a continuous, rapid-fire loop of pops sounding like a machine gun.  I ducked.  Hitting another button which had a clear purpose (don't remember which) produced a thin red vertical line which rapidly moved from the start of the 1.1 min to the end and back in another endless loop until I hit stop.  Or maybe that was the machine gun was firing at the speedy red line !  Ok, that was enough.  I emailed exactly what I had tried and asked if I was missing something please let me know, else I'd conclude it was not designed to run on Win7.  Nary another peep did I hear from them.  So I'm keeping my word here.<br /><br />I don't think I'm the first to want to have a \""chat\"" with these folks..  They obviously do not want to be contacted !  No address, no email, no phone, just an obstacle course to negotiate in order to email them from within their own software.  Probably a minimum government requirement over there.  But perhaps the Amazon name motivated them to at least send a few basic steps which didn't work anyhow.<br /><br />I've written this before uninstalling the software - concerned the uninstall might blow up the video again and wanting to get this review filed beforehand.

US,32335044,R2R28C45WG80R2,B008MAZ0PU,124109245,Guild Wars 2 Digital Deluxe [Online Game Code],Digital_Video_Games,5,37,52,False,False,Guild Wars 2: Worth the Wait??,"I have been playing the original Guild Wars since 2007. I have played all of the expansion packs. The game was awesome for a first time MMO gamer such as myself. Of course after a while it got boring. (4 years of gameplay is pretty good, though!) So I have been anxiously awaiting the release of GW2, which has been \""coming soon\"" for at least 3 years.<br /><br />**I am basing this review off of the limited content of the beta weekend events, and after more gameplay after the release I will come back and edit my review.**<br /><br />Based only on playing 2 different beta weekend events I have to say...my first impression is WOW! Not to be confused with WoW. But, \""Oh my this is amazing!\""<br /><br />Having only played GW1, and having no other MMO experience, I can't really compare it to EverQuest, WoW or The Old Republic. So if you're looking for that kind of comparison, I can't help you.<br /><br />Where to start? The graphics are amazing. The skills look so very cool. They finally look like their descriptions. When your skill says \""Send a Phoenix\"" the game has a very cool fiery Phoenix that flies out and attacks. Ground turning to lava? Yup, the ground turns to lava. A fountain of water? Yup, a big geyser pops out of the ground. It is very easy to get caught up in just trying out your skills to see what they look like. And you have the ability to jump, which means you also have the ability to jump from heights and die. You can then choose to respawn to a waypoint, or wait for someone to rez you. And, yeah, every character in GW2 can resurrect you, which is pretty cool. No more having your group almost wipe but for one person who didn't bring a rez.<br /><br />With GW2 you no longer have to cash in quests. No more \""talk to this person, do this, then go to that person or someone else for your reward.\"" The world in GW2 is open. Events and quests are ongoing. As you run around you run into quests and events. You help with it, you get credit, you get a reward emailed to you. You don't help with it, you don't get a reward. You can't stand around or camp your character and get credit from what I can tell. You have to participate to get credit. Events can fail, and then you have to wait for the event to happen again. This open gameplay is something that I really enjoy. No more teaming up, begging for a group. You can just run around and help people if you want. Or run by if you don't want to help. Either way, it's pretty cool. So far people aren't very friendly, but I'm hoping that will change after the beta events end and the game goes live.<br /><br />If you have played GW1 I don't think you will be disappointed. They have kept a lot of what made GW gameplay unique (including the NO SUBSCRIPTION FEE!). Their MMO land is a land where every \""real\"" player is your ally. No killing other player characters. You will not level up just to get stomped by another player. If you get stomped, it will be by AI (unless you are in PvP land). This was exciting for me, after hearing my hubby complain about most MMO's.<br /><br />The beta events have had kind of limited access to the other races, but I have finally played all 3. The Asura are by far my favorite. They are cute and tiny, and have the best laugh emote. I am completely disappointed with the Sylvari, which looked fantastic in the concept art, but are pretty ugly in game. The Norn and Charr are big and lumbering. You never feel like you're running because they are so big. The humans, as in the original GW, look fantastic. The ability to customize your character is nice. Not only do you have a lot of basic options for face, hair, etc, but you can also then customize them further, much like the Sims, by changing their features around.<br /><br />I am disappointed in the armor thus far. Hopefully this is just part of the beta, but everyone looks the same. You have light, medium and heavy armor, but they all look the same. And then you start finding or buying armor but they are not class based, so every one still looks the same.  Granted, I have not gotten any of my characters very high level because I really wanted to try out ALL of the races and classes (that and they deleted all of your characters from the first Beta, so I didn't want to get too attached or spend too much time on them).<br /><br />What else? You don't have a multi-class option anymore. No switching your secondary class. Each class is the same, with the same skills unlocking. This is kind of disappointing, but in my opinion is made up by the different skills unlocked with each weapon or weapon set. It was fun to try out each set of weapons available for each class.<br /><br />Oh yeah, can't forget the underwater! Swimming in this game is so fun! When you dive into the water you immediately sport a mask (your pet doesn't, so apparently they all have gills). You have different weapons and weapon sets, just like above water. Underwater is really pretty cool!<br /><br />We didn't do a lot along the storyline, mainly because of what I said earlier. If the character is getting deleted, I don't want to invest too much time in it. Once the game goes live, I'll be able to review the many other features, including the Hall of Monuments and the unlocks that you get by playing GW1, and also the bonus items from buying the Deluxe version of the game. The deluxe edition includes:<br /><br />Guild Wars 2 game<br /><br />Summon Mistfire Wolf Elite Skill* This unique elite skill allows the player to summon a temporary Mistfire Wolf pet for use in combat.<br /><br />Miniature Rytlock*  This rare mini is a perfect replica of Rytlock Brimstone and will accompany your character on all of their adventures throughout Tyria.<br /><br />Golem Banker* Your very own golem banker, at your command for five days! This mechanical manservant will grant you access to your account storage from anywhere in the world.<br /><br />Chalice of Glory* Earn some extra Glory with this one-time use chalice. Use Glory to unlock rewards in PvP as well as compare your progress against other players.<br /><br />Tome of Influence* Give your guild a one-time boost of Influence. Useful for unlocking guild vaults, emblems, and other items for your guild.<br /><br />All in all, I think that GW2 is going to be well worth the wait, and I am really excited to create some permanent characters and play through the storyline.o every one still looks the same.

Alien is a masterpiece, and will be forever remembered as a landmark film. It ties with \""The Haunting\"" for my all time favorite movie. The two movies only have one or two things in common: the capability to make an audience afraid, a black and peculiar beauty, and the complete lack of sentimentality.<br /><br />That last characteristic I listed is one of the widely-overlooked features of an awesome horror movie. YOU, the viewer feels pity for the characters, because no one else will. (The only exception to this is another classic-to my point view: The Sixth Sense, which depends heavily on the humanity of the characters.) Despite the fact that I only liked Ripley and Cain, (and that idiot cat) I SOOO DID NOT want any of the characters to run into the alien.<br /><br />The alien is one very original monster. I love it because it is so original. I sound like I'm an old woman when I say this, however it must be said: the look and feel of this movie had never been done before. Species, V, X-files, and countless horror and scifi movies and stories took on the look of Alien after this movie came around, but this is the real deal. A deadly animal that looks like an animal. A spaceship that looks worn, used: a workplace for a group of blue-collar workers who love each other the only way a co-worker can (which is to say, yeah, they don't get along very well, or have much faith in each other).<br /><br />Where did it come from? Where did Ridley Scott get this movie and its awesome monster from? How did he put all of these individual fragments of interesting things together to make a whole so seamless, it seemed as complete as the origin of Dracula (like it was based on a myth or something else)? A sweet and beleaguered screenwriter had an idea about an alien that killed you by having sex with you, and laying it's progeny in your body. (Ew. Wow. But on it's own, what would it have been? To be fair to O'Bannon, I like other things he's made, but the movie as it was would have been another briefly shocking horror movie, this time on a space ship.) O'Bannon liked a few scifi artists, and they were good. (But choose one, and not the other, the ship would have been a pretty prop, heavy with the look of the style of the artist. It would not have been a space ship that people would live and work in.) Geiger's art is impressive, and resonates an Alienesque vibe, (before there was an Alien) however his work is static, and does not translate into the medium of film on its own. Lastly, there's Sigourney Weaver, a brand-new, but wonderful actress in this movie. She and Jonsey the cat serve the same purpose: all of the characters kind of belong in the horror but them. They're there for contrast. Somehow, the director makes all of these odd and shiny objects come together as the masterpiece this is.<br /><br />That gets me to the larger reason why this classic will endure. Why does Ripley constrast so much with the other characters, with the situation at hand, and even with the ship itself? The movie strikes me as an allegory for Hell. The entire movie (as O'Bannon put it) is alien, a place where nothing could escape or live. It's a lot like Virgil making his way through each ring of the Inferno: here in the first ring is Cain, then Dallas, Lambert and Parker...<br /><br />Really really scary.<br /><br />It's also a great fantasy. (Just think about it.) Who hasn't daydreamed about all of their co-workers getting eaten by space aliens? Or...maybe that's just me.",2012-06-13,644,extra_long,2012-06,videos

They were the best boy band of the last thirty years.  Sadly they were greatly (and strangely) overlooked here.  When Tony left the band I was heartbroken and even more so when I heard \""Ressurection\"", a lame post-Tony attempt at R&B.  This new album is a long time coming, even without Brian Harvey.  Strangely this really isn't a \""comeback\"" album as it's production is sketchy at best.  The boys deserve better (you would think that a band that sold millions of records throughout Europe would get backing from a major record company).  Like Take That, the band has long since matured and their new album reflects that.  There are traces of the Beatles, U2 and Kings of Leon.  There are great songs here, such as \""Counting Clouds\"", \""You Must Be an Angel\"" and the first single, \""I Can't Get You Off My Mind (Crazy)\"".  Some songs, like \""Nightlife\"" would have been better had Tony sung them.  Sadly this isn't going to return them to their glory days.  Let's hope they make another one, this time with a better producer.  As a sidenote, two tracks released as promo singles: \""Secret Of my Life\"" and \""Falling Stars\"", are not featured here due to issues with singer Blair Dreelan.

OR: buy this simple Movavi download, and set up my webcasts from a PC with a good webcam?<br /><br />Well, not to be sarcastic, simplistic or reductionist, but that depends on our objectives! Most webcasters that are producing products for education, business, streaming web productions, or even on-demand video sales will LOVE this little program. If you're professionally streaming a live concert, you'll need the big guns, from a LiveU backpack to a truck. Otherwise, this will do the trick.<br /><br />The main function of the software is to capture and integrate feeds so you can compile a rocking little video production for Youtube, sale or your own websites and webcasts. There is a video editor included, but you might find you want to import the file after capture to a more robust editor like [[ASIN:B0051M6IPI Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 11 Production Suite]]. Although the editor is nothing to write home about, the export file handling is awesome, on a par with all the big boys. Once you integrate your webcam video, stills, animation, audio, etc., even if you don't use the editor, your save to export offers an amazing array of file types for live streaming, burning DVDs, storing in your cloud for paid or free video on demand downloads, etc.<br /><br />A note to educators and students: this also is a great platform for live and on demand class material.<br /><br />Cons: There is NOT a lot of support with this product. You have to be very careful, if you load into the Amazon cloud, then download to a PC, that you don't reenter the product key both in the install and online-- do it once, then launch the software. Also, if you don't have enough processing power to handle multiple video feeds and large data chunks, you WILL get crashes and freezes, and become frustrated. In general, if you're going to do serious video work, you need a game-level processor, RAM, sound card, etc. If you try to use this, or even Sony Vegas, on a skinny machine, you'll get crashes and freezes. Unlike Vegas, Movavi is not forgiving-- Vegas will dumb itself down to keep up with a slow machine-- Movavi will just crash!<br /><br />The question becomes: do I really need this if I HAVE Vegas? A guarded yes-- there are more capture options, easier source and input integration of stills and other sources, and better export options in file types than Vegas. But, Vegas smokes this when it comes to editing. Again, depends a lot on your objectives!<br /><br />A note to gamers: Have you seen the step by step gaming instructions on YouTube that show character action in a variety of games?

His cozy suburban life is thrown for a loop when his brother-in-law, following in his tracks, is forced to dump a package of CONTRABAND by a surprise border inspection. Now the brother-in-law is in it bad (to the tune of 700Gs) with the roughnecks who were expecting the package. Led by a scraggly and amoral Giovanni Ribisi, these unscrupulous no-good-niks get Wahlberg involved when they threaten to punish him and his family for his bro-in-law's major muck-up. Gosh darn it, now Wahlberg is pulled back into the world he's tried so hard to escape from, forced to pull one last job to keep his wife and kids out of the paws of these vicious thugs.<br /><br />I can ignore how derivative the plot is. This is an old, old, old story (ex-con is forced back in the biz by thugs who threaten his new life and livelihood), and the addition of a giant boat, huge pallets of \""funny money,\"" and a plot twist you can see coming from fifty minutes away do nothing to add a creative spin to the tale. It's so formulaic, in fact, that I promptly forgot every character's name when the movie was over.<br /><br />Wahlberg is one of the few bankable stars left that hasn't completely alienated his fan base. His pretensions aren't very high, which helps, and he is smart enough to stick with what he's good at: being tough, sharp with a word, and cutting an imposing figure. It's fun to watch him, and even though his character here is as flat as a slice of processed cheese, he doesn't seem to be boring himself, and so the audience has a chance to avoid the same fate. Ribisi, too, gleefully chews the scenery as the movie's token Bad Guy Without Limits, and although his character behaves in ways that would normally get him arrested in seconds, his overall implausibility is dismissed by the sheer volume with which he plays the bad guy.<br /><br />There's action here, too, although it's equally implausible. Smuggling, it seems, is all about timing and foresight, and although Wahlberg's bunch gets thrown more than a few curve balls, they all seem to have the keenest sense of timing. Count how many times someone avoids detection or discovery by a literal hair's-breadth, and you'll probably hit double digits before the film's half-way mark.

I never played any previous Gothic games, and maybe it's not up to par with the previous games, but still very enjoyable on it's on merits.<br /><br />I originally read a lot of negative reviews from many different sites.  However, I did some searching and found a video review on youtube by \""Zeitgeist Reviews\"", which not only persuaded me to buy it, but after playing through it I thought it was a pretty fair review of the game's worth.  If you need a DEMO, can be found on STEAM.  Got over 30 hours of gameplay and got my character to level 29.<br /><br />This is another 3rd-person, action-RPG from a European developer/Publisher [similar to Divinity, Risen, and previous Gothics].  The graphics are pretty good but horribly optimized; I can run Crysis better than this game.  Gameplay/fighting is fun, crafting is dumbed down like in Witcher 1, Magic is almost non-existent (only 3 types - fire, ice, lightening).  Not many armor/weapon types to find, but there is still a variety.  A few annoyances were the lack of unique NPCs [non-playable characters, many have recycled faces], and about half way through the game you'll notice that SOME of the monster types are repeated.  However, you'll still find new and unique monster types still popping up throughout the entire playthrough.  The story is pretty generic [as the others have mentioned], typical good vs bad, but was still enough to keep me interested.  There were some graphical issues that happened, \""black textures\"" popped up a few times.<br /><br />The stability of the game is very good [only 1 crash-to-desktop in over 30 hours of playthrough], considering the publisher of this game went bankrupt [JoWood] and it is now a game published by Nordic Games; hasn't been updated/patched/supported in over a year.  There was a patch back in 4/2011 before JoWood went under that updated the game to 1.1.0.1433; the same version that removed SecuROM [that's right!!!  NO DRM INCLUDED, in fact my copy from Amazon didn't even come with an activation KEY; always a big fan of no DRM].<br /><br />I can finally say, I bought this game on sale for $5, and say it's worth a max of $10-$15 [I think $20 is a little steep; however I'm a cheap gamer].

It is not a new game style, but not a common one these days.<br /><br />You initially control 4 soldiers, and send them on missions.  In this case, Aliens have invaded earth so the missions are about Alien killing. As you complete the missions your Soldiers gain XP and level up earning more abilities with each promotion.  Additionally each Soldier can be 1 of 4 classes with their own unique abilities.  (Sniper, Heavy, Support, Assault).  Combat is about tactics which anyone can learn, it's mostly logic.<br /><br />Inbetween missions, You can upgrade your base of operations and perform Research & Engineering for new Weapons, Armor, Tech all related to squashing Aliens.  And your missions also provided needed Cash, Alien Tech, Alien guts needed to advance Research & Engineering.  You'll also be able to upgrade your squad from 4-6 soldiers per mission and need at least double that in soldiers as wounded soldiers require recovery time if injured on missions.<br /><br />I'm also very pleased with the Storyline.  The game has excellent pacing retains some random element of hit/miss chance and best of all to me is the difficulty level.  I highly recommend all new players start with easy mode.  This gives a good level of challenge while still being easy enough that at worst you'll only need 1-2 reloads to complete missions.

How to deal with FFLs,  shippers that will accept firearms etc.  The content is mostly about *selling* on the Gunbroker  auction site and there are some good tips on how to list your weapon to best advantage.  The advice on buying is very limited and many of my basic questions were unanswered.  How do you value the gun?  Should one buy from vendors with a no return policy?  What to look for in assessing the gun?  Red flags that suggest an unscrupulous vendor?  What recourse do you have if you get ripped off?  None of these questions were addressed.<br /><br />A good portion of the advice is basic common knowledge and some of it is redundant.  Do you really need a page of text to explain the ebay bidding system?  A discussion on transmitting FFL licenses is repeated verbatim in a later section.  This is a significant chunk out of a very short book.<br /><br />What I really didnt care for are his political rants.  About one third of the book is standard anti gun control rant with ebay as his special peeve because they wont allow firearms to be sold on their forum.  I wanted information about buying and selling firearms online.  I really didn't need to hear his politics, his religion or his sexual preference.  I certainly don't feel like paying for that rubbish.  And gimme a break - ebay is a *private* forum and is under no more obligation to allow firearms to be traded there than your local hardware store or McDonalds.  It's their business and they run it how they damn please.  Yes we have a free market in this country (kinda sorta) That means you can go and start your own auction site just for guns which is what gunbroker did.  It does not mean you can require people to trade in goods that they are not comfortable with.  And he warns that if you disagree with him, it's probably because you are afraid to hear another opinion!  How about I like to think for myself?  I wouldnt be much bothered if all this were reduced to a few comments, but why should I be paying for the privilege of hearing someone's pet rant.  None of it is even original.

No - we were exposed to Tim Halperin because AFTER his dismissal from said talent show, Kidd Kraddick (our local Radio DJ King, if you will forgive me for using that description) was determined to make sure that what had just happened to Tim during American Idol didn't underestimate who this artist was destined to be.  And I have no problem understanding this concept since the same thing happened to Chris Daughtry one year on that same show... am I right?<br /><br />So I was exposed to incredible video performances of Tim Halperin music online by Kidd and his crew, and I grew to love \""The Last Song\"" immensely, of course.  I grew to love Tim's persona as well.  The next step for me was to wait and see what Halperin's forthcoming album was like.  His album was released in September, I think, on a competitor's site only.  I was patient and waited the extra 2 weeks for Amazon to have the release of RISE AND FALL on it's site.  By early October I had it in my hands.<br /><br />It is now over three months later, and I am surprised that he has yet to receive a review on his album.  So I am more than happy to provide that!  (Allow me to note that as I write this, the super-low five buckaroo price of this album is currently an incredible steal.)<br /><br />There are no throwaway songs.  This is an important concept to me since I do not appreciate filler on any album.  No filler here.<br /><br />It is pretty upbeat, shows a man's love, yearning, and support of those around him in its message, and does not really portray any negative image.  His unique voice and style then make it difficult to put him in any class of artist yet.  He is like John Mayer and Coldplay mixed into one artist... IF you ignore John's wronging of our girl Taylor (by Taylor's own semi-admission, mind you) and the fact that Coldplay's magnificence is untouchable as far as artists go.  :)<br /><br />Besides \""The Last Song\"" being a strong anthem for Halperin, I am particularly fond of the tracks \""New York\"" and \""I've Gotta Know\"".

So much fun!  There are two types of \""quests\"" as far as the game is concerned.  One is called \""planetary battles\"" and my laptop doesn't have the version of DirectX that the game wants, so I can't play those.  Not a problem, though the implementation is a bit strange.  I start the game, it tells me it can't play, then it starts.  ::shrug::  I have motion sickness problems too easily to want to play those types of quests, anyways, so it's no big deal.  The other type of quests is text based -- literally along the lines of \""you see this in the distance, what do you want to do\"" and you pick a, b, c, or d.  I do think it's a bit misleading to say that there's only two types of quests, as you get these quests by stopping by a planet and asking if there's anything special you can do.  Sometimes, you'll get an opportunity to do one of these quests, but much of the time you'll get an offer to deliver something within a specified timeframe.  Other times, you'll be told that they have no work for you.  Which isn't a problem, as you can purchase goods to ferry somewhere else and try to sell at a profit.  Or you can go try to kill Dominators.  Or pirates.  Or be a pirate yourself and hold up some other spaceship.  Or investigate uninhabited worlds to search for treasure.  There are always new ship hulls to buy.  Or faster engines or newer and more deadly weapons to purchase and use.  You can put some of your money into the bank and watch it grow over time.  You can read the news blurbs to find out the next place that will be a battle against the Dominators (even if you don't want to fight, you can go around afterwards and clean up -- literally and monetarily -- by picking up the stuff they left behind during the fight.)  As mentioned in other reviews, the best thing about this game is that there's no requirement that you do any one thing.  And you can always stop being the good guy -- or badguy -- at any point and act completely differently.  (Some characters in the game will exhort you to help them or to go kill the Dominators, but you can ignore them with no impact on your game.)",2012-01-01,415,long,2012-01,games

This expansion actually does what expansion packs are supposed to do, and that is add on content to keep the game fresh, fix bugs and gameplay issues and give you a reason to spend more money on a game you already have. And it does it quite well.<br /><br /> Civilization V Gods and Kings includes the addition of Religion as well as Espionage as we have seen in earlier instalments in the franchise, but does so in a completely new and innovative way that we have not yet seen. These additions included in this way allow you as the player to experience a copious amount of new content through two completely new major gameplay features, and while they seem familiar and are easy to learn they are fundamentally different than the earlier versions thus exciting and fresh. I won't go into anymore detail as they are listed on the page and I don't want to ruin any of the \""exciting and fresh\"" but that is what I found them to be. But these two features dramatically change the game, and personally added a lot of much needed replayability to the \""vanilla\"" version of the game.<br /><br />There are several new leaders to be played all heads of their respective civilizations and with that all new leader bonuses and special units. This of course adds a lot more variety to the game (I.E. replayability) as well as variety in abilities and units that you or your opponents (or allies technically) have thus in turn possibly changing your strategy around. These new additions simply add base depth to the game, and fortunately allow a lot of players favorite Civ's/Leaders from previous games to make appearances. And of course some of the new leaders special traits involve bonuses in the new Religion/Faith system.<br /><br />There were several new maps and scenarios added in this expansion pack, these features are also just added depth and variety. New artwork/Units/moves/abilities, ect. As well.<br /><br />All in all this expansion pack does what it is supposed to do, or atleast what I had hoped it would do and that is expand on the game, adding new features as well as variety and making the game more enjoyable and most importantly more replayable. Civilization V Gods and Kings for its cost adds a lot of content and doesn't seem to break anything or have a downside game wise, so if you are wondering whether it's worth it as a long time Sid Meier fan as well as just a Civilization fan I find this expansion to be a welcome addition.<br /><br />Original Civ V rating 4/5, a slight dissapointment considering the earlier instalments and not as enjoyable as the fourth game. Though it was pretty good considering other games on the market.<br />Civilization V with Gods and Kings 5/5, this expansion fills a lot of gameplay holes, adds a lot of variety and makes the game overall a more enjoyable experience. I find myself not simply running out of things to do to stay entertained with these new strategies and ways to go about the game.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Civilization V, or feel you would have if it had a little more work done with it and had some expanded gameplay features then this product is definitely a recommendation.ies, ect.

I have to say I really enjoyed this collection. It was rather refreshing to have such a wide variety of tales within one volume.<br /><br />I don't plan on going over each story, but I will touch upon a couple that really stick out in my head. One such tale just happens to be the very first in the collection, Hammer Down is a heart pumping story of Homely Hal, a truck driver and his truck, Molly and the precious cargo they aid in delivering during a horrible blizzard. 'The Call' is a suspense filled tale of a found cell phone and a nightmarish discovery when attempting to return the phone to its owner. Finally, 'The Skylight Saga (A Satirical look at paranormal romance)' had me laughing out loud as I read it. Yes, it will probably piss off fans of a certain book series, but for me it was so funny. I loved it.<br /><br />The other 11 stories are very enjoyable. The attention to detail in setting and characters is well done. The characters themselves are given believability (when believability is desired, I should say) which aided in my actually caring or not caring about a character when things began to happen to them.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a fan of short stories and enjoy a nice collection with variety, I highly suggest you pick up Mental Menagerie: A collection of genre-bending short fiction.

Myself, my family, and our business have all used Norton for the past 10 years but are done.<br /><br />I was double and triple-billed in 2010, 2011, and 2012 for Norton 360 on 1 computer. Why? Because every year I digitally replaced my Norton product with the most updated version when prompted by Norton through your software-- and yet they continued to bill me for the previous version! Again, I was replacing old versions digitally on only ONE computer and Norton had the gall to continue to bill me for old versions no longer even installed on my computer, since Norton replaced them when I updated!<br /><br />When I called Norton to explain this, I was first helped by a courteous young lady on Michael Babbit's staff in Springfield, OR who explained to me Norton's ridiculous and stubborn policy regarding refunds. She however was polite and respectful in speaking with me. When I spoke to Michael Babbit, her high and mighty supervisor, it was an entirely different story. The guy was condescending, rude, unhelpful and pompous. Like a little child he continued to repeat \""You never toggled off auto-renew! This is policy!\"" while offering no other insight or help. I am neither stupid nor unfamiliar with the concept of auto-renew. I make 95% of my purchases online, including all types of software. However I have never once paid a renewal charge on an outdated product that the company has prompted me to replace with a newer version by any company other than Norton. When I explained this fact and said that due to this I did not understand how Norton could possibly justify this, he sneered \""How can I explain this to you in a way you'll understand?\"" If their conversations are recorded, they can easily go back and listen to our conversation and won't have to take my word for what a jerk he was to me. He called me on Monday, 8/20 at 2 PM Pacific Time. I have honestly never been so insulted by any company's employee in my life. The fact that this guy is a supervisor is LAUGHABLE. Makes their company look absurd, as does the fact that they clearly endeavor to make some extra money by conning consumers into unknowingly paying auto-renewal fees on old versions of your product.<br /><br />In short: I am done with their company, as is my family of 8 and my family business. That's close to $1,000 a year that they have chosen to forego for overcharging me a few hundred dollars. Great business strategy! That coupled with their mediocre product should surely keep them as the #1 Antivirus product for a LONG time.<br /><br />I recommend you switch to Kaspersky Lab, which is a far superior product with excellent customer service and business practices. I am in no way affiliated with them but have been very pleased since I replaced Norton with them. If you do a simple Google search, you can find a rebate that will get you their Pure antivirus software free for the first year. As opposed to Norton which gives nothing free and overcharged me for the past 3 years. Done and DONE with them.",2012-08-23,543,extra_long,2012-08,software

While I've always respected and admired Chick Corea, his energy level was always a little too much on the frenetic side for my personal tastes.

However, that being said, I thought it fit well within the general  UFO and \""ancient aliens\"" mania that dominated during this period of Americana, circa the late 1970s.<br /><br />Tells the story of a crashed alien spacecraft that was accidentally brought down by a shuttle orbiter crew. The same crew that would be publicly blamed for the death of one of their fellow astronauts in order to cover up the crash. And why? So that the news announcing the discovery of extraterrestrial aliens wouldn't interfere with the re-election campaign of the sitting president.<br /><br />Got that? The premise of this flick is that the powers behind the throne, most notably the president's Chief of Staff, wants to avoid panic before an *election*. Sidestepping the fact they would never release that kind of information, short of the UFO crashing directly into Times Square. The fracturing of social order, financial meltdown, mass public panic and potential global collapse might, one would presume, take precedence in the order of priorities.<br /><br />From there the story, and especially the following scientific inquiry, spins off its wheels careening toward the ludicrous and blatantly stupid.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, the story comes on the heels of Watergate. And, with or without UFOs, this is essentially an uninspired government conspiracy flick. So 'Hangar' is fairly representative of the times and mentality of filmmakers during this period which saw a plethora of similar productions.<br /><br />Actually, and sadly, it's not that all different today after 9/11, except with the added twist of planetary invasion and/or human armageddon.<br /><br />What interests me is the Hollywood mindset and how it fixes the fears and fascination of people in the mid-1970s to a specific paranoid pinwheel.

To some extent that still holds. Originally when I bought the album (for >$1, and even then I thought I was spending too much) I only liked Teenage Dream and Firework sort of. Luckily, after much gritting of teeth and forcing my mind to stay open, I ended up kind of liking it enough to say it was worth my $1 (and maybe more).<br /><br />Serious guilty pleasures for me are CALIFORNIA GIRLS and LAST FRIDAY NIGHT aka I will openly say I hate these songs. Both feelings are true. When both came out and played every other song on the radio, I wanted to kill her for making such annoying songs that were way to catchy. Still I can only listen to them once in a blue moon or the irritation sets in. The remix with Missy Elliot of LAST FRIDAY NIGHT is far better, cuz Missy Elliot is da bomb.<br /><br />Teenage Dream and Humingbird Heartbeat are my two favorites on the CD. They kind of have the same premise, but both have a nostalgic sound behind the lyrics as well as at face value. I really love Hummingbird Heartbeat because it reminds me of the music that was on the radio when I was growing up. Though, I am not a fan of the first line \""you make me feel like i'm losing my virginity.\"" In this way and many others I am worried that Katy is going in the direction of Rihanna with TALK THAT TALK. SEX, SeX and more sex. I'm not sure either one of them is even more tasteful. This also shows me how Katy Perry struggles with a good metaphor at times. Firework is a nice feel good song, and I especially like the video. Seriously though, who in their right mind feels like a plastic bag (this line almost ruins the entire song for me)?!<br /><br />Despite being a little heavy in sexual expression, I do like DRESSING UP. The lyrics seem to be a little more clever than Katy's usual innuendo filled songs. As for the other two new tracks PART OF ME and WIDE AWAKE, once again annoyed me when they came out, but they grew on me gradually.<br /><br />I was reading reviews on the original version of the album that included NOT LIKE THE MOVIES. Many were saying that this is Katy's best ballad. I, myself, find this song utter rubbish. OK, maybe not that bad, but THINKING OF YOU is a far better ballad and still my favorite Katy Perry song. On the original album I think CIRCLE THE DRAIN takes the cake on the ballad award, but in this \""confection\"" WIDE AWAKE is where her voice shines the most.<br /><br />Peacock has some capable lyrics and some simple but intriguing background music, but in the end it drives me crazy because its just so stupid. Pearl for me is forgetable. Lastly, and least in this case, is this Tommie Sunshine remix. Its dull, plain, uncreative, limited imagination, repetative, all that stuff.<br /><br />After listening to the album I think there is quite a bit of reptition. There are a lot of twins on this album or from her last album.<br />Teenage Dream: Hummingbird Heartbeat<br />The One That Got Away: Thinking of You<br />Circle the Drain: Part of Me<br />E.T.: Dressing Up (I KISSED A GIRL)<br />Firework: Pearl<br />I think you could find a match for almost every song. For this I think the record deserves 2 stars.

It gives me hope for the future of Katy Perry's next try, so I'm going to give it a 3.was reading reviews on the original version of the album that included NOT LIKE THE MOVIES. Many were saying that this is Katy's best ballad. I, myself, find this song utter rubbish. OK, maybe not that bad, but THINKING OF YOU is a far better ballad and still my favorite Katy Perry song. On the original album I think CIRCLE THE DRAIN takes the cake on the ballad award, but in this \""confection\"" WIDE AWAKE is where her voice shines the most.<br /><br />Peacock has some capable lyrics and some simple but intriguing background music, but in the end it drives me crazy because its just so stupid. Pearl for me is forgetable. Lastly, and least in this case, is this Tommie Sunshine remix. Its dull, plain, uncreative, limited imagination, repetative, all that stuff.<br /><br />After listening to the album I think there is quite a bit of reptition. There are a lot of twins on this album or from her last album.<br />Teenage Dream: Hummingbird Heartbeat<br />The One That Got Away: Thinking of You<br />Circle the Drain: Part of Me<br />E.T.: Dressing Up (I KISSED A GIRL)<br />Firework: Pearl<br />I think you could find a match for almost every song.

Gene Kelly stars as an ex-GI named Jerry Mulligan, who decided to stay behind in Paris to pursue his dream of becoming a painter.  He has a cute little apartment with collapsible furniture, and has made some very good friends on the small, narrow street where he lives.  One is the perpetually grouchy, Adam Cook (played by Oscar Levant), who describes himself as the world's oldest child musical prodigy.  He is also friends with Henri Burel (Georges Guetary), a wealthy nightclub performer, who is engaged to marry a young, perfume sales clerk named, Lise (Leslie Caron in her first American movie role).<br /><br />After rich and beautiful socialite, Milo Roberts (Nina Foch), becomes his sponsor, Mulligan and young Lise meet at a club.  The rest of the plot of course, is pretty predictable, as a romantic triangle develops.<br /><br />The sounds and colors of Paris are amazingly duplicated, as director Vincente Minnelli recreates the cafes, the flower markets, and the cabarets that Paris is known for.  Of course, there is no shortage of joyful Parisians who are willing to drop everything to join in a song and dance (even the little children).  The music is by the incomparable George Gershwin.  Like all musicals, the mainstay is always the music and dancing, and An American in Paris, certainly has plenty of both.<br /><br />Although he was a passable singer and actor, Kelly's clear talent was dance and choreography.  From the simple but lovely dance he performs with  Leslie Caron in \""Our Love is Here To Stay\"" to the over the top ballet, \""An American in Paris\"" near the end of the movie The entire film is a testimony to Kelly's talents and is something that audiences will never forget.<br /><br />Leslie Caron was a wonderful dancer, but here, it is obvious that she was not a convincing actress.  However, over time and a few more films, she did get better.  French entertainer, Georges Guetary was not Minnelli's first choice for the part of Henri Burel (Maurice Chevalier was first choice, but it was decided that he was too old for the part), Guetary turns in a fine performance as the fun, dashing, and likable Henri.  His number, \""I'm Building A Stairway to Paradise\"", certainly showed off his amazing high tenor voice, and the note that he held at the end of the song was definitely a show-stopper.  It gave me the chills.  Comic relief came in the form of Oscar Levant, especially when he found out that Henri and Jerry were both in love with the same girl.<br /><br />Although \""Singing In The Rain\"" would turn out to be Gene Kelly's finest musical, \""An American in Paris\"" is certainly a close second, and should be on the watch list of every Gene Kelly or MGM musical fan.<br /><br />Cast-<br /><br />Jerry Mulligan--- Gene Kelly<br />Lise Bouvier----  Leslie Caron<br />Adam Cook---- Oscar Levant<br />Henri Burel---  Georges Guetary<br />Milo Roberts--- Nina Fochnot Minnelli's first choice for the part of Henri Burel (Maurice Chevalier was first choice, but it was decided that he was too old for the part), Guetary turns in a fine performance as the fun, dashing, and likable Henri.

The story reveals an unknown aspect of Bram Stoker's original tale by exploring the doomed voyage of the Russian schooner Demeter as it ferries a mysterious cargo from the Black Sea to the shores of England. Hidden in the hold are fifty boxes of earth and the lord of all vampires, Count Dracula himself.<br /><br />We're introduced to the Russian captain Smirnov and his crew, along with a refugee Englishman named Harrington and a mysterious crew member hiding a dangerous secret. As the crew rumbles about a bad feeling onboard and mysterious weather follows the vessel, the crew of the Demeter begin to disappear one after another, falling prey to the predatory vampire hidden in the bowels of the ship's hold.<br /><br />As a lifelong fan of Stoker's book (as flawed as it is), this was a real treat to go back and revisit this classic with Lamoreux at the rudder. It's a brilliant concept, exploring the untold tale of the cursed voyage of the Demeter. The action is fairly standard vampire stuff, sticking close to Stoker's parameters but it's well told and a delight to read. Lamoreux writes with such authority about ships and seafaring life of the late 18th century that one can almost feel the spray on your face and hear the creak of the ropes.<br /><br />Overall, Dracula's Demeter is a wickedly fun read and a delightful addition to Stoker's classic tale.

In the meantime though, you get to soak in just how beautiful the Philippines really are. As the opening credits slowly roll on, there's is nothing but lush green scenery and the sound of wind chimes becoming louder and louder. It is literally the calm before the storm.<br /><br />Luis (TJ Trinidad) is given a medal by the mayor for exceptional work on the police force despite his unorthodox ways. As his friends on the force discuss celebrating, Luis is distracted by a woman who desperately seeks closure on a twelve year old case that was never solved involving her two missing daughters. Elsewhere, Ella (Barbie Forteza) is dragged along with her cousin Janine (Lexi Fernandez) and her boyfriend Brian (Derick Monasterio) as they try to teach Janine how to drive. The abandoned road they practice on has its own horrendous past as it chooses to play mind games with the three teens. As Ella and her friends turn up missing, missing persons cases that haven't been solved in years are reopened including the twelve year old case and an undiscovered murder from thirty years ago.<br /><br />\""The Road\"" is divided into three parts devoted to different time periods; 2008, 1998, and 1988.

It's a bit difficult to get a read on how cheesy the movie is going to be early on, especially during one particular moment in 2008. It had this \""Jeepers Creepers\"" kind of vibe at first, but thankfully that didn't last. Things do eventually not only get better, but become downright terrifying.<br /><br />2008 is mostly psychological scares; cars appearing to be driving themselves and bloodied individuals with plastic bags over their heads chasing after Janine and Brian or walking along the side of the road. 1998 has Lara (Rhian Ramos) picking up her younger sister Joy (Louise de los Reyes) from school as their car overheats on the road. A boy around their age who happens to be walking by (Alden Richards) claims to have water at his home, but things turn ugly once they actually get there. 1998 is where things get a bit more brutal. The psychological aspect is still there, at least for Lara, but torture comes into play and all hope is washed down the drain. 1988 is the story of a young boy (Renz Valerio) and his abusive mother (Carmina Villaroel).

Bathory's story is a fascinating one and I think what it makes it even more interesting is that we will likely never know the whole story and the truth (there's even the possibility that she was framed). Still, centuries after she died and committed atrocities rumors persist about Erzebet Bathory: did she commit those crimes? Approximately how many young virgins were killed? Obviously it's not a \""nice\"" story; in fact it's a rather dark and evil one if you must know the truth.  The Countess is very much French actress Julie Delpy's brainchild for the most part as she wrote, directed and starred in its lead role.<br /><br />I don't know what viewers were expecting given that this film is obviously more of an independent release than a major release one, the acting in The Countess is a tad dry but I don't think it's awful; the performances are not so bad for a relatively low budget movie. Obviously the movie is not historically accurate and is more of a re-imagining of Elizabeth's tale. I can understand why to complains but I can't recall many movies that tackle the tale of Bathory and this one while not superb is not awful by any means.  filmmaking wise it was a good move and shows a more human aspect to it that justifies the murders. I thought Julie Delpy made a brilliant Bathory in some ways and she portrays her as very cold and intelligent woman yet she is also mysterious and reserved as you would imagine but there's also the part of her that loved and still loves; the part that hurts when her heart was broken. Love was integrated in the movie as the reason she committed the crimes (with her accomplices of course) Although some are complaining that she's not acting as evil or possessed as they would've liked but obviously this isn't the Elizabeth Bathory they wanted to give to viewers this wasn't the angle they had in mind for her. The way I see it they wanted to show a more human angle to her and less folklore fantasy that have accompanied her tale for centuries now. But there's just that something that doesn't make her give a truly great performance, it's as if she's holding back or doing too much and there's very little I liked that they didn't go with the predictable bathing in blood thing, in the movie she is not seen bathing in blood although she does put her hands in it and put it on her face. To Delpy's credit it is a complicated role to portay and I thought she still did a good job. They would have done well to explore things like Elizabeth's childhood further and her education being that she knew many languages, how she tortured others (but in The Countess they show accomplices using a device that I don't think Bathory ever used as it seems she preferred to inflict the punishment herself, however, that would have been interesting to see) and her taking over where her husband left off for instance.<br /><br />I think most of us would expect a more savage and ruthless Elizabeth Bathory from this film but instead what were getting here is a more psychological and perhaps more complicated approach to her. I must say I enjoyed the film but to be honest the running time is a bit short for a film on one of the greatest true horror stories the world has known. The Countess runs at an hour and 35 minutes and while it covers a lot of territory and most of what is important I thought it would have strongly beneficiated from at least an added 30 minutes or even perhaps potentially an hour. They could have explored her childhood more and developed certain aspects and elements further because at the end I felt it was short for such a story. Overall it doesn't end up being THE definitive film on the story of Countess Bathory and maybe that will come someday but its best we have so far and it's very enjoyable and not the worst independent film I haveseen. I have had a fascination for Countess Elizabeth for some time now and although the film is not perfect it's certainly a good imagining of her story and her romance and the result is enjoyable. As a fictionalized account of Elizabeth Bathory it works well but some of the acting left a little something to desire and I was left with the feeling that the movie ended up being too short as I already mentioned. Did I like The Countess? Yes, but I didn't \""love\"" it. If you have even a light interest in the Blood Countess, this is an interesting film although it is neither essential nor required viewing. ***seen.

Important choices would have to be made sooner or later, and they wouldn't be easy---no matter what decisions were reached, there would be pain involved.<br /><br />And my musings were soon proved to be correct: this story begins about two months after the conclusion of the first book, and while the two men had been letting things slide up to that point, it was apparent that actions would soon have to be taken that would permanently affect their lives, one way or another.<br /><br />As I was reading I kept wishing that I could take Aiden aside, and tell him that he was pushing for far too much, too soon, too emphatically. But then, I also wanted to tell Daniel that he really did need to be more understanding as well, and try to look at things from Aiden's point of view on occasion. Well.... That's what makes for good drama, eh?<br /><br />We get a glimpse into additional aspects of the world of the Amish this time around, and the picture isn't entirely positive. A lot of people do view the Amish way of life with a sort of romance, through rose-coloured glasses---and I'll admit I have been guilty of this myself. But in this story we see that the very structure of this constricted, walled-off society does leave itself vulnerable to all sorts of unchecked abuses. This is a real problem, and I've read a few accounts of some of these scandals in the papers from time to time, though often these problems go unreported.<br /><br />A mystery that was a small part of the plot of the first book plays out in the conclusion of the second. But, I have to say that the solution is extremely unlikely! I mean, almost ridiculously so---I don't think any reader could guess how things would end up given the clues (or lack thereof) that were present in the text. Then again---I have to admit that I've read many mysteries over the years that were just as preposterous, so I'm not complaining too much.<br /><br />Actually, the fact that right near the end certain adventure/mystery story elements come to the forefront (with one of the main characters being put in peril) was a surprise to me. Because this really isn't a mystery at all---it's the study of a developing and evolving relationship between two men from extremely different backgrounds. And so the shift in tone in the last ⅙ or so of the text was unexpected. Still, that's not really a negative necessarily, just an observation.<br /><br />I have to say I loved both Aiden and Daniel, and was totally caught up in their story. I wouldn't mind reading even more about them, though I don't know that the author has any plans to continue their tale.

It seems a bit more \""advanced\"" than most video editing software programs in its price range... which is a good thing in my opinion. I will update this posting as I delve more into it, but for the price it seems very versatile, with a lot of good export options.<br /><br />This is a possible fyi for those of you using other legacy Adobe products in conjunction with it. Let me explain:<br />I use the Adobe Design Premium CS5 suite (not really looking to upgrade to CS6 yet). However, A few days back I installed a new SSD hard drive, and commenced with a fresh install of Windows 7. The trial of Premiere Elements 11 was the first Adobe product I installed, and it ran great. Today, I decided to install the CS5 suite (transferring all licenses according to Adobe protocols). The install went as planned. Then when I tried to \""update\"" the CS5 products (Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, etc...), the Adobe Application Manager gave me an error, and none of the CS5 products were able to be updated including Camera Raw (not good). Sadly, since this is a new product, there doesn't seem to be a lot of available info available on the web.<br /><br />My next steps...<br />I think that the software from Premiere Elements 11 installed before the CS5 install threw a monkey wrench in to things. So here's what I did:<br />- Uninstall all Adobe products. Back up everything first (files, Premiere Element 11 Catalogs (use the web to figure out where Adobe hid this), etc...)<br />- Download the Adobe Creative Suite Cleaner from Adobe - follow the instructions in the included documents. This is the only way to get everything off the computer.<br />- Restart your computer<br />- Install the CS5 or lower version suite. After install, run your updates. (Updates were successful!)<br /><br />This is where I stopped. I plan on re-installing the Premiere Elements 11 software. I just hope that I can run CS5 updates after going through all of this. Primarily Camera Raw updates (this is the most important update for me).<br /><br />I'll follow up soon with any more issues... and an overview of the product itself.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Update #1:<br />Re-installed Premiere Elements 11 software, and ran the updates.<br />Same error... darn.<br /><br />However, on a good note, I really like the features and functionality of Premiere Elements 11.

The writing was strong and the I really liked the intro. I liked Kendra, the young antiquities store assistant we met in the prologue. I even liked Ryan, the man we are introduced to in the epilogue. The two are supposed to be representative of Kendrick and Roane, two lovers from the 1800s who were torn apart by war and the mistaken reporting of Roane's death.<br /><br />I was not too fond of Kendrick or Roane. When Roane comes home to find that Kendrick has moved on in the face of his 'death', he is furious. He seeks to humiliate and bend her to his will to....what? I'm still not sure. It seemed as though he wanted her back, but he wanted her to squirm a bit as well. Fair enough. But the way he goes about it is a bit cruel for my taste and his 'foreceful seduction' of her was over the top and a turn off. When he finds she is a virgin, THEN he becomes contrite for being so cruel...for me it was too little too late to redeem him and honestly his complete 180 did not resonate with me. I still didn't care for him. Kendrick was a pushover and a flat character. At least Roane had some dimension.<br /><br />The reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of a lower ranking is because I found the way the author wove and past and present together to be very clever. Also, the writing is very strong. But for me, this story could have been a bit stronger. I appreciated the attempt at making Roane a sympathetic character because of his bloody background in war.

I feel justified focusing this review on the DRM because when you buy this product you're basically only buying a password.  You can enter this password into the trial version of MS Office 2010 to convert it into a full version.  The trial version comes pre-installed on many new computers, or you can probably download for free, or you can definitely download once you purchase this item.<br /><br />It is pretty awesome that Amazon tracks the password for you.  You can get it anytime from your Amazon account.  However, it doesn't help the rating because this is a benefit provided by Amazon not by Microsoft Office.<br /><br />=====================================================<br />The installation / DRM:<br />(DRM = Digital Right Management)<br />=====================================================<br /><br />I was dissatisfied with the DRM because I wound up spending a lot of time and energy because I needed to install the product (legitimately) twice.  I had to install it twice because I installed it once on a laptop that I had to return.  When I bought the password for Office I knew that I was going to have to uninstall it and transfer the license, so I carefully read the product details to make sure that I would be able to do this.  It was possible to do the transfer, but it was much harder than I expected and than it needed to be.<br /><br />If you're going to buy only the rights to software, the manufacturer should make it easy for you to manage those rights. This software is not cheap, and I want to know that after I buy it that I can be confident that I have the rights to use this software according to the terms and agreements.<br /><br />However, Microsoft (not too surprisingly) didn't make it easy to manage my software license.<br /><br />There was no way to deactivate the original installation of the software, and I spent a lot of time searching for this option.  I used the help in MS Office, and direct searches on google that searched the general web and Microsoft's site, but I never found anything.  Using the help in Office is frustrating and time consuming, and not helpful.<br /><br />Without a way to deactivate the original software, I simply uninstalled it.  I figured that since it was a MS product in an MS operating system this might do the trick, but it didn't.<br /><br />When I installed the product a second time it didn't detect that I had uninstalled the original, so it wouldn't let me activate the new product initially.  I had to call Microsoft's activation hotline to activate the software.  As I recall, the hotline is completely automated, but not a 24 hour hotline, which seems to me like another senseless annoyance.  The hotline process involved waiting, and pressing buttons, and waiting, and eventually entering a ridiculously long and complex series of letters and numbers into their form in the software.<br /><br />The only reason that I can imagine that Microsoft wouldn't have an option to deactivate the software is because they're hoping that some people will be frustrated or confused and just buy a new one.  This is the kind of thing that Apple likes to do, and I don't like the trend of Microsoft trying to be more like Apple.  It's ok to be a boring but reliable commodity!<br /><br />In short, I spent time / energy<br />1) Researching the ability to transfer the rights before my purchase<br />2) Trying (fruitlessly) to deactivate the first installation<br />3) Trying to activate the second installation<br /><br />=====================================================<br />The product:<br />=====================================================<br /><br />Overall, I like Office 2010 better than 2007, but I miss Office 2003.<br /><br />** Office 2010 vs 2007 **<br /><br />It seems to be a little more stable, intuitive, and have higher performance.  Also, the feature bloat wasn't too bad in 2007 to 2010, like it was from 2003 to 2007.  There are some subtle touches that improve usability, but nothing dramatic... which is a good thing.  MS Office is something that I simply want to rely on and use, not something that I want to completely relearn every few years.<br /><br />With Office 2010 they introduce yet another case of limited backwards compatibility.  Now when I save a Word document created (or maybe just edited?) in 2007 it doesn't save, but rather it asks me bewildering questions about compatibility that imply that I will corrupt my document by simply saving it.  Really?  Again?  I don't want to become an expert in MS color palettes, templates, or use of normal.dot, I just want to send someone a memo.<br /><br />Microsoft, please stop trying to artificially introduce backwards incompatibility to increase sales.  It's really annoying, and we know that you're doing it.<br /><br />** Office 2010 vs 2003 **<br /><br />This was such a mixed bag, and it's already been discussed to death.  However, ya'll weren't finding my original review helpful, so maybe you'll like this...<br /><br />Excel:<br />I could probably do a thesis on this, but here's a short list<br />Great: we can open / create bigger spreadsheets, and the conditional highlighting is super duper.<br />Not great: just about everything else.<br /> - Pivot tables went from being an amenity for power users to becoming something that nobody understands.<br /> - The ribbon is interesting, but still annoying and unnecessary.<br /> - It's confusing that the \""developer tab\"" comes hidden by default.<br /> - Charts are now extremely slow (much slower that 2003) for data sets that are not even that big<br /> - Speaking of 2003, it's hard to keep multiple installations of Office.  It would be nice to have 2003 inside 2007 and 2010<br /> - It suddenly became hard to see which sheets are highlighted / selected, so now I'm frequently editing multiple sheets without realizing it and ruining hours of work.<br /> - But the biggest problem is definitely the overall bloat<br />The new excel has way too many new functions.  Many new functions should simply be a combination of existing simpler functions.  They also introduce new backwards incompatibility and unneeded complexity.  VBA is the worst part.  There are no so many ways to do things in VBA that it's very hard to find the simple methods to just do stuff.  Recording a macro used to make something intelligible that you could re-purpose, but now it's an exercise in futility.  The one thing that VBA needed was a nicer IDE, and did we get that?  Nope.  Do you know who did get a nicer IDE?  R. (Yes, that's the letter R.  If you don't know what R is you can google it.)  R is about the only thing I use anymore, which means that all my time invested in being great at Excel is mostly down the tubes.<br /><br />Word:<br />Like Excel it's even harder to do simple things.  For example, it's hard to make a document single spaced and hard to make that the default (although I think this got a little easier again in 2010).  Also, the whole new paradigm that every word document is a separate application window (but not actually an independent application) is so extremely stupid.<br /><br />PowerPoint:<br />This is the one bright spot.  It's gotten better and better with every iteration.  PowerPoints still look like \""PowerPoints\"", but that's not so bad; at least it works!  If Microsoft decides to make some swanky application to make infographics that don't look like PowerPoint, I hope they put it in something besides PowerPoint.  Maybe publisher?  Nobody's using that anyway.<br /><br />Publisher:<br />Haha, just kidding!  I don't even remember if I bought it.<br /><br />Access:<br />I never liked Access; it's confusing, slow, and hard to use.  As computers have gotten faster and storage has gotten cheaper, Access has stood firm in it's limited ability.  It's still going to take forever to do the simplest things no matter how many processors you have.  I don't think I bought it for 2010, so I'm really just reviewing 2003 and 2007.  There are so many free options that are fast and efficient and connect to Excel that it's really only the most sadistic manager that forces Access on anyone.<br /><br />The Help (all applications):<br />The online help is unbelievably awful, especially for VBA.  You pretty much have to use the online help (which is the default) because they've actually taken documentation out of the installed help.  The installed documentation that is left behind is riddled with errors, missing examples that used to be there, and has weird formatting errors everywhere.  The online help is also so bizarre, confusing, and useless.  There are filters to decide where to search, but the search doesn't work.  It's like the internet, but not as effective.  Also, you now get all kinds of different products returned at once, so you can't just find help on one thing like \""functionality in Word\"".  Any search is likely to take you to places that are devoted to downloading community templates or clip art rather than telling you something useful like \""how to print in a booklet format\"" or \""how SUM handles N/A! values\"".<br /><br />So, I was a little offended that only 1/3 people found my review helpful, so I rewrote and extended it.  It's much longer that anything I would like to read, but my review isn't for me it's for the people!<br /><br />I do hope you'll find this useful, but if you don't please let me know why in the comments, thanks",2012-10-19,1621,extra_long,2012-10,software

The songs get downright formulaic. A set number of repeat choruses (of which there are far too many for my taste),  with no variation whatsoever in the way a phrase is sung from repeat to repeat. A guitar solo or song breakdown is in the same place in nearly every single song. There were no pleasant surprises. Everything was just too predictable. I even bought the digital version specifically for the three additional songs that were not included on the hard-copy release of The Unforgiving, and yet I find myself skipping over more than half of the 15 songs when I listen to the album. Even the songs I've become fond of are not on my list of Within Temptation favorites.<br /><br />My two biggest problems with \""The Unforgiving\"" are the lyrics and the song compositions. Sharon's voice is still polished and, as ever, improving in strength and range. The band plays with skill and experience. However, the songs just don't have the breadth and scope of those on previous albums. The lyrics are lackluster and even a little laughable at times ( read: \""Murder\""). The Unforgiving is a concept album based on a companion comic book series, but without the comic to supplement, the songs don't actually tell an intelligible story. They don't stand on their own. One literally NEEDS the comic book to understand what the album is trying to convey. It's an interesting marketing ploy but unfortunately turns the album into a glorified commercial. I don't want to be sold a comic. I want a good piece of music that I can enjoy.<br /><br />I count Within Temptation among my favorite bands and only hope that their next album it isn't as disappointing as The Unforgiving.only hope that their next album it isn't as disappointing as The Unforgiving.",2012-02-18,376,long,2012-02,music

Anyhow she asked/begged me to get this music for a project at school. But i had to listen first to what i would purchase. This is the worst piece of crap i have ever heard in my entire life. My dogs even started howling when i started it and would not stop until i stop the music, so i had to stop it mind you, it was becoming overwhelming in here as my lovebird would not stop chirping loudly to try to chirp louder than the music and cover the sound with their chirps i had to tell them to bug off so i could actually hear something, but obviously that did not work. I swear it almost made my ears bleed ... ouch. This is just horrible. It has no beat, no good rhythm. I looked at my daughter with pain. Why would she ask me that ? It even made me go do #2 as soon as I stopped it. Well i dunno.. i have listened to a lot of music in my life, but nothing compare to that. My 8 years old son begged me to stop it before he goes sleep and asked me not to do that again while im on the computer, and the wife kept yelling at me to turn it off that she was trying to do her yoga session in the living room. Sigh.. i wish it wasn't quite that bad but let's be honest here, this isn't the most enjoyable music. I don't know what to do honestly. Daughter said you can find the song for free but she really wanted to buy them for her school project. And i mean, 8,99$ who are we trying to kid here ... for a buck each songs. I don't know. I might have some thinking to do. Although it sound like a zoo in here whenever we put his music on, i want to please my daughter but at the same time, my wife, my son, my dogs, my lovebird ... i don't know. And somehow ... i don't know what happen, but we also found the beta fish laying on its back tonight .. i hope it has nothing to do with the music too. Anyway, i suggest you don't buy.

Firstly, in response of those who rated amazon poorly for support issues, patches are easily found through paradox forums once you register the game on their site (like any of the paradox games).  You can find the link to their site on the launcher once you have installed the game.  Easy as that.<br />Now, for the review of the game.  This may based on the HOI2 game, but it is far from a mod.  It is its own game.  there are more than 2 campaigns (1914 and 1936) in the game with the 1.02 patch, there are several, including a 1933, a 1940, a 1941, and 1942, with more sure to come with future patches, as well as other promised improvements.  Play any country, and as the situation changes, play new countries that arise or newly changed nations with every savegame (want to play a communist Germany from 1933, change the whole story of the world war 2, there is a decision for that that comes up in the 33 scenario) The new map, the improved graphical interface, and the speed of the game are astounding.  I had doomsday and have played HOI3, and this trumps them.<br />Heres a few criteria for you if you want to know if you should get this game.<br />If you liked HOI2 and wanted more detail, a better map,  and more depth-  GET THIS GAME.<br />If you bought HOI3 and wished it was faster, had more realistic  provices, and a better timeline- GET THIS GAME.<br />If you have played other WW1 or WW2 games, with all their eye candy,  but wished that you had more flexibility of grand strategy- GET THIS GAME.<br />If you like Victoria or Victoria 2, but want a more realistic great war experience-GET THIS GAME.<br />If you want to get a game that is created by members of the modding community, who fervently support their game, listen and engage with their fans, and openly and passionately support modifications of their game to constantly exapand and improve the game experience- GET THIS GAME.<br />If you have 10 bucks, and want a game that is worth 100-GET THIS GAME.<br />Did I mention...GET THIS GAME..",2012-04-13,382,long,2012-04,games

It was truly enjoyable playing with a friend or two as it gets quite boring, repetitive and can get overwhelming playing on single player mode.<br /><br />What's the difference you say?<br /><br />Single player - do a flying kick, knock down zombie, beat him up while watching your own back cautiously, rinse...repeat...while doing the quest.<br /><br />Coop - do a flying kick, happily knock down a zombie and beat him up knowing your friend's got your back.  Then get a surprise of more zombies popping up to grab you and you're thinking where in the world is your mate and then realize he slipped and fell somewhere high and needs help.  You frantically break-free, go to his rescue, and try to do a running drop kick on the zombie that's near him only to realize it was a high level thug that won't just fall down from a simple drop kick.  Gives a whirl at you and sends you flying into a pool.  And both of you end up dying and saying \""oh no...my hard earned money!\"" - Edge of the seat moments you'll enjoy playing with some friends.<br /><br />Some elements have been borrowed from Left 4 Dead series - like 4 players can play at the same time for coop.  Let's you revive a \""downed\"" friend if you got some extra medkits with you. Some \""uncommon\"" infected have some additional skills and harder to kill unlike the other common zombies that just grab and bite you.  And the way point is highlighted to you on the map depending on the quest (though Left 4 dead doesn't have a map - they kind of improve it in this game).<br /><br />Now for the shining difference - each of the 4 characters in the game has his/her own specialized skills and they can level up to unlock their specific skill tree.  Like Xian for example, she's especially efficient to use sharp weapons which gives extra damage instead of using other weapon types.  And she can run faster than the other characters but she cannot take a beating.<br /><br />Another unique feature of the game is the \""Fury mode\"".  If your rage meter is full (it fills up every time you kill a zombie), you can unleash your \""Fury\"".  Reminds me of \""Limit Break\"" in FF7 and \""Rage Meter\"" in Samurai Showdown.  When in Fury mode, your character flashes (as seen by your teammates), your vision changes, and your weapon changes specific to your character and you can do \""special attacks\"" for a limited time and do massive damage.  You can literally clear a whole room of zombies alone with this move though it doesn't make you invulnerable.<br /><br />Also a nice touch is the \""weapons mod\"".  If you get a blue print to mod a weapon and the necessary required parts, you can...well...mod your weapons (ala FallOut 3)!  Make a machete have the ability to cut and electrocute zombies, or have that baseball bat spiked with nails for additional painful damage.<br /><br />Graphics are awesome.  Sound is great.  But it is all hampered with....BUGS!<br /><br />Now, on to the bad side of the game...<br /><br />Graphics - They're pretty good!  The island looks awesome and refreshing you'd want to live in there.  It's the occasional things (though forgiving...sometimes!) that may leave you shaking your head - like for an instance, you know there's zombies behind that door as you can see their arms trying to grab you...through a closed unbroken door!  And sometimes, a zombie can get into a closed door!  Wow!<br /><br />Sound - They're good as some reviewers say.  But if your playing Multiplayer and both of your mates are in the same area they activate the quest with the same guy, you will hear an echo of what that quest giver is saying but have a 1-2 second lag.  It doesn't affect the game but it's annoying.<br /><br />Multiplayer - The best to play in multiplayer, but has it's own quirk.  Sometimes you won't see your friend's avatar even if he is standing there in front of you and trying to initiate a trade.  Also when your friend opens the doors, in your view - the doors are still closed.  There seems to be something like a latency problem where both of your games are not getting synchronized with one another.  This doesn't usually happen however.  But if it does, it's pretty annoying and time consuming to drop out and restart from the last checkpoint.<br /><br />Aside from that, we get the occasion game crashing, getting stuck at one particular area where you can't move, can't leave a mounted gun after having fun with it, can't get the weapon back you've thrown at a zombie sometimes, and losing some weapons when you get disconnected abruptly by an unknown force.  Which really isn't forgiving.<br /><br />Without these bugs, it could have been a really great addicting game.  Some reviewers say the quests are stupid because some quest givers wants you to retrieve a necklace and wine.  In my opinion, it does give this game another dimension as some people in the world are indeed like that in reality.  So yes, the quests and circumstances in this game can be real - EXCEPT THE FOLLOWING:<br /><br />- Zombies carrying deodorants.<br />- You won't glow when your angry and do incredible attacks.<br />- Trash cans don't have something useful in them like phones, full charged batteries, bleach and car parts!<br />- People won't auto-equip Alcohol and stupidly drinking it accidentally while fighting zombies (I hate this bug the most!).<br />- CPUs won't have large batteries in them.<br />- Beer Pubs/Bars won't have a lot of energy drinks lying around.  (Are people getting drunk up on this game in energy drinks?!)<br />- Supermarket filled with useless stuffs. (except for a lot of energy drinks, and...Alcohol in the ice cream freezer?)<br />- And literally driving a pick-up truck into the sea from beach to beach (All pick-up trucks should be like this in reality!).<br /><br />Summary: It's a (sometimes) scary and fun game especially with a friend that will add on to the \""unpredictability\"" of any repetitive quest (like throwing a molotov onto a group of zombies only to suddenly realize that your friend is in there).  Some bugs are funny.  Some bugs are unforgivable, but the shining things in the game makes up for them.<br /><br />Conclusion: Buy it and play with a friend or two...or three. (If you can forgive the bugs in this game).<br />Recommendation: Buy it when on sale!<br /><br />My Rig:<br />CPU: AMD FX 6100 (3.30 GHz)<br />Memory: 4 GB<br />Motherboard: GA880GMA-USB3<br />OS: Windows 7 - 64 bit<br />Video: ATI 6800",2012-07-29,1135,extra_long,2012-07,games

The piercing cat-in-heat vocals of the female adds nothing to this track... instead, it makes it sound like an abomination, the result of overzealous music producers trying to cash in on the \""hard alt-rock with female lead singers\"" genre that has lead to such plagues like Skillet and Evanescence. They are the Creeds and Nickelbacks of the rock genre, bland bands that sound alike with no real distinction other than how much mascara the males in the band wear.<br /><br />Back to the song. The song was good when released. Made for a soundtrack, and served its purpose well. With the addition of a banshee yelling in the background off-key with no mixing other than volume levels, the song has the same quality one would expect from a child singing into a microphone to his/her favorite Dora the Explorer song (but at least, it may be considered \""cute\"" in that case). In this case, someone spent money to fly the poor, talentless child to a recording studio, sit her down and say, \""hey, here's a song that was popular among a niche group for a few months, give it a go and see if we can't spice things up!\"", and then pay to have it released nationwide. It makes as much sense as spending money to have Rebecca Black make songs.<br /><br />Can one blame the female singer for doing this? Not really. As bad of a singer as she may be, if someone was offered money to sing something, they would take it, even knowing that they may sound like Oscar the Grouch on crystal meth and Red Bull. Perhaps, due to circumstances, one can blame Breaking Benjamin, assuming they hold all the rights to the song. However, blame can be applied to the \""composer\"", \""mixer\"", and distributor. Note that the first two are in quotation marks to emphasize sarcasm, as the distributor is the only one out of the three that knew how to do their job correctly, whilst the others had the ambition to their jobs right like Bonnie Grape had to lose weight (that is a reference to the book \""What's Eating Gilbert Grape\"", for those of you who don't know, or rather, the movie, for those who were born in the generation that promotes music like the one this review is about).<br /><br />Digressing back to the point of the review, if there is any slim chance that the Stop Online Piracy Act can somehow stop abortions like this from ever occurring ever again, then not only do I support it, I will bludgeon those who oppose it, feed them to iguanas, then take the fecal matter that is produced by those iguanas, load them into a rocket, and fire that rocket into the sun.e others had the ambition to their jobs right like Bonnie Grape had to lose weight (that is a reference to the book \""What's Eating Gilbert Grape\"", for those of you who don't know, or rather, the movie, for those who were born in the generation that promotes music like the one this review is about).<br /><br />Digressing back to the point of the review, if there is any slim chance that the Stop Online Piracy Act can somehow stop abortions like this from ever occurring ever again, then not only do I support it, I will bludgeon those who oppose it, feed them to iguanas, then take the fecal matter that is produced by those iguanas, load them into a rocket, and fire that rocket into the sun.",2012-03-07,617,extra_long,2012-03,music

I've rarely had any complaints running these games on Mac Pro hardware. Here are a few of the highlights that Aspyr has cooked up (only took them 2 years to port something this bad) for Mac users, especially with the multiplayer version:<br /><br />1) Quad 2.8 GHz Mac Pro with 1GB GPU, 12GB RAM defaults to less than 1024x768 and low quality settings. It's 2012 guys!<br />2) Regardless of res or quality settings the online play lags frequently, even if there's only 5 or 6 players. When there's more than 12 it's unplayable at times.<br />3) All servers run by Aspyr and connected to Game Center. No private servers, no PC gamers. Typically less than 200 people online.<br />4) The Vote feature doesn't work. Can't switch maps, vote to boot troublesome players, etc. Aspyr gives users no power to do anything.<br />5) Can't start your own multiplayer game / pick a map and game type from scratch.<br />6) Aspyr support ignores requests for help with the bad performance (not surprising considering they obviously did not test it / don't want the expense).<br />7) COD 4 (a 5 year old game) offers comparable graphics and much BETTER performance on exactly the same hardware.<br /><br />The single player game is OK but overall this port for the Mac is lousy.

Mr. Hall, who is the front man for the band created a \""monster of praise\"" when he stepped out in faith and gathered the saints of this marching band to the streets. Carrying too many nominations to mentions and a room full of awards received, this chart topping crew has again created a fantastic conglomeration of life issues both inside and outside of the church. \""Come to the Well\"", which is available for purchase October 18, 2011 is sure to win several more marks on the nomination board for the Crowns.<br /><br />Radio stations are continually playing their first hit release off the album \""Courageous\"", which was written as the theme song for the recently released film. Courageous reaches out to Fathers and Husbands to take a stand and be courageous in the strength and the power of the spirit of God inside of them to protect and lift his family up. It pleads with men to be full of integrity and character and walk in humility before the Lord. Echoing a message throughout the earth that resounds in all households regardless of choice of faith, it calls to the heart of the Father in a way that cannot be ignored. Incorporated into film, it would not surprise me if it spreads through mainstream radio in a similar fashion as their fellow crusaders for Christ, Mercy Me managed to do with \""I can only imagine\"".<br /><br />From their first platinum album simply titled \""Casting Crowns' to their sixth release they have managed to develop an expectancy in fans to deliver nothing but artistic brilliance and spiritually challenging messages. \""Come to the Well\"" offers a rich new sound to listeners by delivering a variety of beautifully written lyrics with a distinctively different melody in each song.<br /><br />The second track \""City on the Hill\"" demonstrates the urgency toward the body of Christ to put aside our differences and incorporate the importance of the Cross. The availability of God's saving grace to a world in desperate need of hope and peace. \""Each one thought that they knew better, but they were different by design. Instead of standing strong together, they let their differences divide.\"" The melody of this song is easily felt in the heart of the listener and will move you to tears and awaken the spirit of God in your life to put aside your differences and set your eyes on the prize of your faith.<br /><br />The third track on the album, \""Jesus, friend of sinners\"", happens to follow up right behind the previous message. Speaking to the hearts of Christians to stop pointing out sin in the lives of sinners and begin to repent our selves and pray for the lost and the hurting instead of judging others. \""Jesus friend of sinners, break our hearts for what breaks yours. You love every lost cause, you reach for the outcast. For the leper and the lame their the reason that you came, Lord I was that lost cause and I was the outcast, but you died for sinners just like me, a grateful leper at your feet.\"" Being very easy to relate to and having an extremely addicting melody this is quickly becoming my favorite.<br /><br />It is comforting to know that our Lord already knows the plans He has made for us if we walk in submission to Him. Though it may not always be easy we can find some peace in knowing that. \""Already There\"", is a rock ballad that reminds us that it's all in His hands. \""The Well\"" touches the heart of those who are tired and looking for what is missing in their lives. \""The world will try, but it can never fill, so leave it all behind and come to the well\"". It is a persuasive message that has the potential to bring many people who are saved but still broken to a place of freedom and full acceptance of the promises of God in their lives.<br /><br />Sometimes as a Pastor it is a struggle to look out upon his congregation doing the best he can to be obedient to the Lord and yet still see so many people hurting and bound in their spirit. \""Spirit Wind\"" speaksto the heart of those who face this kind of struggle and reminds us that God can speak to the dry bones and raise them up again no matter what the situation looks like. God is able.<br /><br />Displaying the heart cry and joyous emotions of three different life situations you will find \""Just Another Birthday\"", \""Wedding Day\"" and \""Angel\"" magnificent additions to this marvelous combination of encouraging messages. You may also be able to use these as tools for people who normally would not listen to Christian music.<br /><br />If you want a song to get your heart pumping and your spirit revved up, \""My Own Worst Enemy\"" delivers a punch to the CD that adds a little different seasoning. If I had to compare the sound, strangely it would be Skillet. It is definitely invigorating and can cause an unexpected Jesus jam session to arise if you are not prepared. The lyrics consist of how we often hold ourselves back from the best God has for us. \""Could have sworn I put him in the ground, looks like he's found his way out.

God is able.    Displaying the heart cry and joyous emotions of three different life situations you will find \""Just Another Birthday\"", \""Wedding Day\"" and \""Angel\"" magnificent additions to this marvelous combination of encouraging messages. You may also be able to use these as tools for people who normally would not listen to Christian music.    If you want a song to get your heart pumping and your spirit revved up, \""My Own Worst Enemy\"" delivers a punch to the CD that adds a little different seasoning. If I had to compare the sound, strangely it would be Skillet. It is definitely invigorating and can cause an unexpected Jesus jam session to arise if you are not prepared.

Liu<br /><br />THE MORTAL BONE is the 4th novel in Marjorie M Liu's Urban Fantasy Hunters Kiss series.<br /><br />FROM THE WEBSITE:  The Hunter Kiss series is about the last living demon hunter on earth -- a woman covered in living tattoos that peel off her body at night to form her own personal demonic army -- an army that is her only family, dedicated to saving her life -- and destined to end it.<br /><br />Maxine Kiss is a demon hunter, a warrior and according to the 5 Reaper Kings-she is their Queen.  But Zee and the boys (the Reaper Kings) have literally been torn from her body by an unknown force that left her injured and filled will pain and heartbreak. With their bond broken, Max is once again mortal in a world of demons and monsters. And the longer the boys are separated from Max, the more violent and vicious they become.  The one saving grace, should Maxine get pregnant her daughter will not have to bear the demon burden that has been passed down for 10,000 years.<br /><br />Grant Cooperon is Max's soul-mate and her husband.  As the last Lightbringer, his power to heal will be tested many times with each encounter against the demon hordes that attack his wife. But when a demon searches for Max, the gift that is presented represents more than a piece of glass stone-The Crystal Skull is one of 13, each with a power of its' own, and the Skull looks very familiar to Max.<br /><br />Throughout the storyline, Max and the boys continue to cross the void hoping to find a clue as to what happened between their bonds. And finding someone who knows the whole truth is harder than they think.  Each demon Clan has a different story to tell, about the Reaper Kings and the death and destruction they have caused throughout the millenia, and now that they have been `released' from bondage, their reputation has put fear and loathing into every demon they have crossed. The separation from Max has opened the veil between the worlds, allowing the prison walls to crumble. But it is the new Vessel that will truly put fear into the demons, when she fully comes into her powers. The sharing of their souls will make a prisoner out of Max just as the Kings were held prisoner by a 10,000 year old curse.<br /><br />Zee and boys were keeping Maxine in the dark. Revealing the true nature of their bonding, Max and Grant are stunned to learn that the Reaper Kings were once the Vessel of power that controlled the demon kings, and now that the power has been transferred to another, the demon clans are refusing to follow their new Queen.  The boys will continue to take Max on a journey of discovery but meeting with Old Wolf and the Messenger will reveal more to Max and Grant than they could have imagined.  Not only is Max destined to save the world, but Grant has some new found abilities as well. With power comes responsibility, and to abuse that power could put everyone as risk. Choices must be made.<br /><br />THE MORTAL BONE is a fast paced story that reveals Maxine's history through a retrospective look at the demon history and the ramifications throughout the demon worlds.  Knowing that your destiny has already been chosen is never easy, but to learn the fate of mankind is now in the hands of a mortal woman, is something no one would ever have suspected.<br /><br />Although I strongly urge everyone to read the series in order, I am eternally grateful for authors like Marjorie Liu when they include plenty of the major background information from previous storylines.  New readers to the series are less likely to find the storyline confusing, if they happen to read out of order.

After a long download and install process, I've found Magicka to be the gem of the bunch.<br /><br />Magicka has no inventory, no money, no character classes, and no leveling up.  You start and end with the same eight basic elements (and two combo elements) you start with.  From the start you can combine them all at full power.  The learning curve consists of figuring out how the elements combine into powerful attacks, or in just how to approach a fight.  Not all of it is obvious, and there is satisfaction in figuring out a new method of fighting either the hordes of goblins or powerful bosses.  In addition, there are the titular MAGICKAS; spells that use a specific sequence of elements to do everything from create a thunderbolt to teleport.  Finding the spellbooks is your reward for fully exploring areas.  Some Magickas are more useful than others, though I probably haven't figured out some combos yet.<br /><br />The game approaches it's own genre with humor, going meta many times.  Pop culture references abound, from the pithy episode titles (the first six all are mocks of Star Wars films) to Monty Python routines.  The game breaks the fourth wall at times, even mocking it's own limitations (early on a woman promises you coins if you solve her rat problem.  After you do, she tells you the game doesn't have an inventory system).  Powerups consists of a weapon and a staff.  Each time you find a new one you need to decide if it is better than the one you have.  With each new checkpoint, there is no going back for your old items.<br /><br />Are there problems?  Yes.  One thing the game lacks is a proper save system.  At times, objects and even the player gets \""lost\"".  This frustrated me when I lost a staff I was particularly fond of in Episode 4.  A few times during the tutorial would not work correctly.  One boss went into the not-fun zone (though in the end my solution, though tedious, fit the weakness of the boss).  Some enemies are too dumb to live, taking heavy damage from my steam beam without moving.<br /><br />Most of all, Magicka is FUN.  You can start playing right away and experiment with your elements.  I started with an obvious one; using water spray, then lighting to fry many opponents at once.  As I progressed I went from a one trick pony to having several combos I use depending on the opponent.  A few bosses forced me to learn new ones.<br /><br />Problems and all, I recommend Magicka.",2012-06-20,444,long,2012-06,games

I figured I'd give it a shot, and voila: it works!<br /><br />Yeah! Okay, please note that I do not tweak my computers -- I simply use 'em. So far, this game has played just like it used to. The one thing I noticed is that loading seems to take a bit longer but maybe I'm impatient.  It cannot be played in window mode on my Toshiba 305.<br /><br />Still, it works -- plays a-okay and that's a bonus for me. For the price, it's a good one.

However, it has been a technical nightmare from the start. The download is over 2GB, so even on my 40 Mbps high-speed connection it took 20 minutes to download. Not really a big deal, but then it took another hour to install and set up.<br /><br />Once running, the microphone config utility did not work properly. At first, it didn't find any installed microphones, even though I have an internal mic and a good external snowball mic that both work fine with other programs like Camtasia and Captivate. After restarting several times, it finally found the mics, but then froze when trying to configure them with the software. Once I finally got RS to recognize both the mic and my voice, I tried to take a simple lesson where you repeat the numbers one through six in Spanish. However, the program would not recognize the way I was saying them. I've had 2 years of high school Spanish and one year of college Spanish, so I think I know how to pronounce \""uno, dos, tres,\"" and so on. I even adjusted the speech recognition setting to the most forgiving \""easy\"" level, but it still didn't like my pronunciation. I finally got it to accept all numbers except for \""seis\"" by putting on an exaggerated accent to mimic the male speaker, but by that time I was ready to throw a brick at the computer.<br /><br />The program has an auto-advance feature, which is nice when it works, but I found when I reached the end of a unit it just sat there. I was not prompted to continue, nor was there a clear way to advance. So I ended up hitting the Home icon, which takes you out to the main menu where it then spends the next three minutes synchronizing your course progress (with what, I don't know). However, after it finished, I found it didn't give me check marks next to all the lessons I had completed. I thought maybe this was because I answered incorrectly or mispronounced something in a lesson, so I went back and tried to redo those lessons where I had a red X. However that didn't seem to fix the credit issue either. I am so frustrated with this. I don't want to have to continually repeat basic lessons because I mis-clicked one answer.<br /><br />Also, I haven't even made it half-way through the first level yet, and it has frozen my computer three times. I couldn't even close out of the program or use CTRL+ALT+DEL to end it via Task Manager. I had to hold the power button down to force my computer to shut down. I have a newer HP laptop running Windows 7, so I doubt the freezing is the fault of my laptop. It never did that until I installed Rosetta Stone.<br /><br />I really dislike this software and I am very unhappy that I paid so much for it.

I grew up playing JRPGs (Final Fantasy 7,8,9,10, Xenogears, Vagrant Story, etc.) and consider myself somewhat of a veteran.<br />After leaving the JRPG scene for about 4 years, the only games I've played have been Western (Bioshock Series, Dragon Age Series, Mass Effect Series, etc.)<br />My console days are now over with the completion of my ultimate PC gaming rig--thus I was excited to see The Last Remnant being available on PC and being from the lords of JRPG, Square Enix.<br />I got The Last Remnant for $5 on Steam.<br /><br />Alrighty now,<br /><br />I just finished the game about 15 minutes ago.  I played the first 11 hours fairly--I explored every corner---shopped around--did the whole RPG scene.  After I reached the Nest of Eagles---I gave up on the game--activated God Mode--and proceded to 1-hit everything in the game up to completion which took me an additional 4 hours for a grand total of 15 hours.<br /><br />Let's break it down.<br /><br />Story: Very Weak.  The story up until after Elysion was good--after that--it just jumps around too much.  The creators seemed to not have a clear idea where they were going--things jumped around far to fast to make anything seem coherent.  After 11 hours, I skipped nearly all story scenes as I just didn't care.  Story gets a 3/10.<br /><br />Battle: By far one of the worst systems I have ever seen.  Others say it is the best part and I disagree.  Will break down into points:<br />- First I would like to say the opportunities in the Battle System could have been great--but were horribly executed.  The Unions, forming them, arranging formations, could have been incredible.<br />- Just starting fights is annoying--shifting into the time mode to \""link\"" creeps is just an extra hurdle that is pointless.<br />- The Morale System is completely broken--Morale if low will utterly destroy you--if high--it has nearly no effect.  Once your morale goes low in a fight it's GG.<br />- The commands--are by far--one of the worst systems I have seen.  You can't even specifiy what EXACTLY to do.  You choose broad statements as orders and hope they work out how you please.  There is no general \""heal\"" or \""resurrect,\"" so God help you if a union dies during battle.  Want to heal?  Nope, that command isn't available despite having 100 ATP.<br />- The fights are for the most part based on luck.  Torgal misses his combat art?  Sorry bud.  Creeps that would hit me constantly for 100 would randomly cast some move and crit for 1k, changing the course of a battle--which leads into the next point.  I would re-do lost boss fights with the exact same plan and win because it's based off luck.  This led to NO sense of achievement.<br />- Your unions share 1 pool of HP.  So if you have 5 members in a Union at 1 HP, they all perform at 100%, if they die--all die.<br />- YOU CAN'T EQUIP YOUR TEAM.  You can only equip yourself.  You can buy weapons for other team mates and just HOPE they ask them from you and equip them.  Freakin stupid.<br />Overall Battles get a 0/10.<br /><br />Visuals/Graphics: They were OK.  Nothing mindblowing.  I'd give it a 6/10.<br /><br />Music: Music was great!  I would give it a 7/10 .<br /><br />Characters: No sense of attachment whatsoever.  You have a few main ones, and then 15+ random other ones.  There was also a super awkward bromance going on between David and Rush.  Rush was OK--corny in the beginning---kinda cool in the middle--then back to corny.  Four Generals were just whatever.  Pagus was legit though!  I feel SE's push to have so many characters weakened the game overall.  Main Antogonist was a boss.  Give Characters a 5/10.<br /><br />World: Beautifully well done--but guess what, 1/2 of those cities are just placeholders for generic quests.  In fact, I discovered 2 cities on my own, and skipped 2 cities all together.  Only in the end before the final porition of the game did I discover them.  Very beautiful cities--but they justweren't executed well and integrated into the storyline.  3/10 for this.<br /><br />Misc: The whole grinding for items was made insanely annoying by the fact you were limited to a set amount of digs each time you entered a dungeon.  Did they really expect you to mine---run all the way out--re enter and repeat?<br />The Guilds were a cool way of achievements and I actually liked that---but random Monster spawns were again annoying.<br /><br />Overall--I wanted to love you The Last Remnant--but you were just blah and all over the place.<br />I'll updated later as I'm still depresed over not having my great JRPG adventure.<br /><br />Edit 1: I still think about this game every once in a while and have decided to raise my score to 2/5.

Before she'd graduated from high school, she'd also become proficient on the guitar and harmonica. Hard work and a lot of practice have paid off as the The Stacy Jones Band hit the ground with a steady gallop. They have now released three annual albums including 2009's \""Live at the Triple Door EP,\"" 2010's \""Long Time Comin'\"" and now 2011's \""No Need to Spell it Out.\""  After the 2009 release, the band was recognized as Best New Band by the Washington Blues Society. The following year, the Society named Stacy as winner of the 2010 Best Female Vocalist award. The band's formula for success is to consistently present charged-up music that imparts energy, power, originality and talent.<br /><br />Rick Bowen (drums), Tom Jones (bass) and Jeff Menteer (guitar) are consummate musicians who have the chops, as well as some foresight to push the envelope a bit into some blistering rocking territory. They also all contribute to the band's original material. Special guest Kathy Hettel sings some harmony on two tracks, \""I Think I Feel Like Leavin'\"" and \""Do What You Wanna'.\"" While there are several enjoyable tracks on this CD, \""Heavy Water\"" is a standout track that establishes an engaging groove, includes vocal harmony, and allow Stacy to strut her stuff on harmonica. The following track \""You Belong to Me\"" showcases some of Stacy's fine piano playing. Appearing regularly at venues like The Oxford Saloon in Snohomish, Wa., this band deserves the attention of a larger legion of fans. (Joe Ross)",2012-01-13,273,long,2012-01,music

Another possible title for this show can be \""The last liar standing\"" because every episode seems like a race among the characters; who is going to outsmart and manage to ruin the others.<br /><br />There are plenty of totally absurd unbelievable twists and turns, as in all soap operas, where every possible criminal and indecent behavior is piled up in huge doses; infidelity, murder, fraud, drug abuse, greedy schemes, prostitution, impersonation and plenty more.<br /><br />The hook is typical in TV shows of recent years; everyone is good looking and wealthy, the scenes are opulent and the twists are entertaining, so it makes the viewers feel good about the fact that they are better people than these evil, ruthless and degenerate upper-class characters.<br /><br />The main character that we are supposed to identify with is Bridget, who is relatively better than the others, but she was an irresponsible drug edict and a prostitute and the show presents her as a totally changed woman as soon as she assumed her twin's identity, like a miracle happened to her - absurd, of course.<br /><br />If I critique it as a soap opera then I have to say it's good. But I personally am bothered by the fact that every drama on TV now is a soap opera. It seems like there is nothing to watch now except gritty crime shows and soap operas.

While the overall events of this book did happen (Larry was a homosexual, Tom was an alcoholic, and Ann does have a handicap daughter), many of the details of this \""memoir\"" are purely fiction.  This is one woman's account of many people's lives, and she does a horrendously poor job of relating it.  Memoirs should be emotional and self-observant - this paints her as a saintly woman who struggled through tribulations with grace.  I assure you this is not the case.  Please do not waste your time reading this trash.  As someone close to the family, it horrifies me that Larry is no longer with us and unable to defend himself.  He was a deeply troubled man, yes, and made many mistakes, but no one has the right to publish drivel like this and claim it's non-fiction when one of the main characters is deceased and unable to set the record straight.  She may have her own opinions and recollections about her life, but that's how it should be presented, her OWN recollections and not as fact.  I've spoken with various people involved in this book and they are all offended, hurt, and appalled by her presentation of all of their lives.<br /><br />Furthermore, the only reason I understood most of the events of this story is because I'm a relative.  I imagine if I were a detached reader most of this would make no sense.  Content aside, the author has poor writing style.  No emotion is involved though the stories being told should evoke major emotional responses.  The dialogue is stilted and lacking in real human tone.  And for such major life events to be depicted, she breezes through them with minor detail and thought given.  I'm shocked so many people seem to have enjoyed this book - I can't imagine it making any sense to an outsider!  It reads like high school creative writing class drivel!!<br />For example, when the family goes to therapy: the oldest daughter, who refuses to go toschool, is dragged kicking, screaming, and crying to therapy by her \""hurtful\"" father, Larry.  She seems to have an emotional connection with her mother, Ann, over the trauma.  Most of the children, in fact, are painted as having loving relationships with their mother, while their \""dark and twisted\"" father looms over them.  However, once at therapy, the therapist instructs the children to sit next to the parent they feel closest to.  All but one sit next to Larry!  And Ann merely reacts like \""Oh, how I wish my children were closer to me.\""  As the reader, all one can think is, \""Wait, they're not?!\""  It's all completely non-sensical and quite obviously self serving.<br /><br />I'm not saying this is a case of James Fray memoir fabrication - like I said, these events did take place.  But none of the emotion or true reactions of any of the people involved are at all depicted correctly.  And as a lover of literature, as I said, content aside, this \""memoir\"" is trash.<br /><br />Do. Not. Bother.",2012-04-18,522,extra_long,2012-04,ebooks

I say this not because it reverses or alters portions of the characters or plot, which it assuredly and poorly does, but because it does not tell a story, really, nor is it really a film. It is a collection of barely acceptable motion picture moments edited together with the hopes that what it adds up to is a smart, cute bit of entertainment. It is, sadly, neither smart, nor cute, nor loveable on the whole, though it has moments of likeability. As a matter of fact, the best part of the film is the end. I say this not because the film is over (though that is a bonus, excepting that dreadful feeling that you want a portion of your life back) but because the totally out of nowhere Bollywood-esque dance number is the icing on the weirdly constructed cake. It is the only charming thing about this boredom inducing heap of edited scenes.<br /><br />As for characters, I will start with the ok and work my way into the basement. The heroine (Snow White) is somewhat likeable, but there really isn't a reason or motivation for why she does what she does. She is two dimensional: by turns innocent, pretty and idealistic or roguish, courageous and crafty. These two dimensions are sandwiched together without any development of how they fit within the same person. I felt a bit like I was getting into an argument with a person, in this case the director, who thinks that merely asserting the same thing over and over again will win the day. This tactic may be effective on many, but in the end no one feels good about the result.<br /><br />The Prince character has no redeeming qualities. He is supposed to be the comic relief in a girl-power film. His bumbling and shirtlessness could have been cute or funny. Instead, it's just sort of, well, there.<br /><br />The Witch is just simply dreadful. Julia Roberts simply cannot save this trite, vapid, monochromatic character. I didn't care if she was gotten rid of or what she was doing to herkingdom because she was simply too much of a caricature. There was nothing familiar about her evil that anyone, even a child, could hang their hat on. Nothing shocking, frightening or even identifiably evil on a human scale. The mirror scenes were inexplicable and became the cornerstone moments for my fascination at the lack of artistic vision in this film. (More on this later)<br /><br />The dumbest characters were the dwarves, played by real, live dwarves and midgets. They are supposedly converted from being outsiders and thieves to goodness loving cads by the end. They simply annoy throughout, and, given the fact that Snow White is supposed to be the leader who enacts their conversion, the change is totally unwarranted. The short jokes are not funny. Their \""good-heartedness deep down\"" isn't really convincing. They made me wish I had taken my wife to see the Avengers in the same theater instead, even though she hates comic book films.<br /><br />Finally, there are all the artistic licenses throughout the film to create its atmosphere. The locations throughout, from the palace to the forest to the hut in the middle of a mysterious lake where the mirror is, are surreal. They are supposed to be surreal, I get it. But one is left asking why the choices were made for each. The only conclusion I could come to is that some wonkish art major thought a particular concept would look cool and didn't bother to have a vision of how the entire fictional world fit together. Dali paintings are amazing and surreal. This film is not a Dali painting though. It is components of 4 to 6 Dali paintings in a collage held together by dried nacho cheese.  It looks grotesque in the \""no-talent-hack\"" sort of way and, more importantly, leaves a horrid taste in one's mouth.<br /><br />It was once argued that 100 monkeys on typewriters would eventually turn out at least one play of Shakespeare's, merely by accident. Chance and mere operative intelligence is all that is really needed to get a good outcome. Sadly, this theory was tested with real monkeys once. After a week they hadn't even typed a word in any language. Not even a one letter word. The conclusion of course is that you need real intelligence and real creativity in order to even string sentences together on a page; a human mind can perform such things but an untrained monkey cannot. A very highly trained human mind produces Shakespeare's plays. Given the choice between this film or one edited by those same monkeys, I'll take the monkey film. While it would have less order, it would be more entertaining and thought provoking. It would invite a vision onto a blank canvas. Mirror, Mirror is a filled-in canvas painted with the hands of too many painters, all its ideas crashing into each other causing pain and misery for the viewer. Therefore, give me the monkeys.",2012-07-07,847,extra_long,2012-07,videos

And even if you do own a previous version, this edition is well worth it.<br /><br />Why? Well, if you don't own this album, you're missing a major shift in the Doors' direction, from sinuous adolescent psychedelia to boozy desert blues. It's not an easy shift for the listener to make; it took me easily 20 years of Doors fandom to really come around to this album after cutting my teeth on the poppy \""Waiting for the Sun\"" and the hallucinatory \""The Soft Parade\"" and all.

First, it sounds great.

I suspect these were warm-up jams that just happen to have been recorded. If you're a huge fan, you may want to get \""She Smells So Nice\"" anyway, just for fun, but a \""lost song\"" it ain't.<br /><br />The only thing keeping this from being the definitive, ultimate \""L.A.

Global Warming has caused worldwide flooding leaving millions dead and three fourths of the planet underwater and uninhabitable.  In order to combat the loss of humanity and aid in the rebuilding of societies robots are created.  Unfortunately, not all robots are being created for labor and numerous experimental artificial intelligence models violate international laws, requiring termination.

Japanese doesn't always translate well to English.  The character of \""Big Bo\"" was by far the worst offender with his constant use of \""aight and bro.\""  Ugh.<br /><br />- Stupid AI constantly runs in front of you while you're firing and then proceeds to chew you out for shooting them.<br /><br />- Cut scenes stuttered from time to time.<br /><br />- Use of the spacebar for sprinting/tumbling/cover was troublesome at times if you were too close to objects that provided cover.<br /><br />- No real character choices that could change the outcome of the game.<br /><br />- Characters were very slow to recover after a knockdown/resuscitation.  Often you would go down immediately after being revived as the enemy would just stomp you again.<br /><br />- Game ending was predictable and the final boss fight was lackluster compared to other bosses you encountered throughout the story.<br /><br />- Character movement while climbing ladders was stiff and jerky.<br /><br />- NPC movements can be glitchy, especially when they're next to each other.<br /><br />- Teammates constantly yell at you (Over here! Follow me!) when you're trying to explore to find collectables and ammo.  This gets to be a bit annoying.<br /><br />- Bosses have no health bars and at times it's difficult to tell if you're damaging them or wasting ammo.  I learned that if you see blue sparks/lightning when you're firing at them then they're taking damage.<br /><br />- Some characters are not available to select for your team at times.  This can be bothersome if you just spent a lot of credits upgrading their skills rather than your own.<br /><br />- Some poor water/rain effects early in the game.<br /><br />- Story can be a tad too predictable at times.<br /><br />- Shallow team \""trust\"" based system.<br /><br />- Lacks depth for character/weapon customization.<br /><br />- Stereotypical characters.<br /><br />- Requires use of Steam.<br /><br />- Linear gameplay.<br /><br />- Checkpoint save system.<br /><br />- No crouch option.<br /><br />- Console port.<br /><br />- Too short.<br /><br />Despite a lengthy list of Cons (mostly minor), \""Binary Domain\"" was a relatively short but extremely entertaining action filled shooter.  Filled with challenging and fun gigantic robot boss fights and a storyline that keeps you playing, Binary Domain was well worth the play through.  The level designs, while linear are varied enough that the game always has a fresh approach as you progress.  Unfortunately, it's easy to be put off in the early levels of the game because of the incredibly annoying teammate (Big Bo) you start with.  Luckily you're able to swap him out after you meeting up with the rest of your team in the beginning.  I should mention that I purchased this game during Amazon's Summer Sale for only $9.99 and for the 13 hours of gameplay it provided me I felt it was well worth the purchase price.

Luckily you're able to swap him out after you meeting up with the rest of your team in the beginning.  I should mention that I purchased this game during Amazon's Summer Sale for only $9.99 and for the 13 hours of gameplay it provided me I felt it was well worth the purchase price.

For the record, I'm a white woman, and I really like the \""Rocky\"" films. Having been assaulted by my former partner, I knew exactly how Stallone's character felt when he said \""the next morning's the worst,' and I can sure attest to that. I watched all six movies while locked into a hyperbaric chamber twenty times over the course of a month, from the metabolic holes in my head from the abuse on SPECT scan.., a very expensive month, too, since insurance paid for NONE of it. Which was well over 7,500. And I have good insurance! I was landed on my head by my hair onto a tile floor. You can see in the SPECTs right where I hit the floor. In answer to your question, no, they do the 'nice guy bit' until they think they have you, and then they start to turn on you in what starts out looking like 'just a bad day.'No abusive man goes out with a woman he wants to impress and calls here a horrible name at dinner on their first date, and slaps her in the face, it's more like the frog boiling to death in the gradually heated water. A frog won't sit in boiling water, he jumps out!<br /><br />So, my personal experience correlates to the humble, nice guy in a bad spot--ie Rocky. Who if you'll notice gets his butt kicked by bigger and bigger guys in each film. I could relate to that, also. I can't stand arrogance, \""I'm the greatest\"" never fails to bother me. Because it's naive, someone, especially in sports, will eventually win out over you. I didn't like this character. Arrogance doesn't seem to be a Muslim value, is it? Note in the second Rocky movie, Paulie suggests that if Adrian was acting up, knock her teeth out. Rocky says, \""Well, you know I kinda like her teeth where they are.' You never specifically hear an anti domestic abuse message in the movies.<br /><br />I dislike movies where the sex is gratuitous, namely because it gives people the idea that you can use people and have no consequences, when that's not at all the case. I don't like when women are like Kleenex, disposable and replaceable. I got that from the trailer alone, and I wasn't looking forward to the movie for that.<br /><br />Even in the later films when Rocky did the 'homeboy' thing, which struck me as odd, considering he's a white boy, and it's bizarrely out of place on someone who had to be 45 at the time of the movie. I put up with it, because there were some nice scenes, even as far gone as \""Rocky Balboa,' the scenes where they do the Adrian tour, and that he didn't just hop into bed with that girl. even the meat locker scene about the 'stuff in the basement' was interesting.<br /><br />Part of why the character was an icon is because he gave a lot of people someone to emulate, and to look up to, which you sure don't get here. I wish you did. I was sincerely hoping for it. Remember, the original film was in 1976, when I was small, and the country needed someone to have as their hero.  Vietnam was just wrapping up, the muscle cars were pretty much gone, a casualty of combined astronomical gas prices, and insurance. We didn't have a heck of a lot to look forward to as a country.<br /><br /> I wish this could have given us another icon or character to emulate and admire.<br /><br />I love the Rocky films because I was sincerely hoping for that here, a sincere, honest man, just trying to do his best, who loved his wife sincerely, wasn't treating her like a stray dog you can kick as you choose (and I love dogs)  and wasn't cheating on her with every woman in sight, full of skeeze we don't really need to see. He couldn't even beat guys up as a 'collector.' Frankly, I hope we get a chance to someday see another character like that again. But then, it's only been 36 years!

Each song demonstrates the collaborative efforts and creativity that has gone into this album. From the first track, Days, the difference in this album is apparent. Unlike Score, personally my favorite album Steve Thompson has produced, which was primarily a solo project that utilized heavy electric and synthesized sounds, God's Justice has a raw and professional edge with a variety of instrumentation. Cenotaph Centauri is a 9 minute opus in the middle of the album, blazing with heavy guitar and steady percussion before creeping down into a more distant and atmospheric sound until it concludes with a range of sporadic electronic riffs. My personal favorites are the more simplistic, but no less impressive tracks. I enjoy the folksy blues rock of Eben Byers, and the upbeat fast paced guitar work on Warlords. Ishmael's Axe, the concluding track, has a great guitar solo and probably demonstrates the best vocal work on the entire album. Tithes and Offerings offers an impressive Jazz rock sound reminiscent of King Crimson's 21st Century Schizoid man. My only gripe with that particular track is that the vocals do not stand out well, and are faded into the background noise, making them dark and distant. I enjoyed the instrumental piece, The Senators Tree, but would have liked it to be a little longer. It is short and concise, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I believe it had potential to rival the Centauri in creativity. It starts out with the beat of African style hand drums, leading into a whining guitar and a haunting synthesized organ sound in the background. March of the Damned is the only track I feel didn't have much to offer.  Songs like Age of Confusion and Last of Species were much more interesting overall in lyrics, vocals, and sound. March of the Damned starts out interesting enough, but after about the third minute of the six minute song, begins to feel long and drawn out. Perhaps this was Thompson's intent considering the name of the song. Overall though, I would say this album rivals Score and demonstrates Thompson's ability to experiment with a range of different creative styles in his work. The hard work, dedication and efforts of everyone involved stands out, making it one if not the best album he has ever done. It includes such a variety of musical styles, but acts as one cohesive piece as well, that there should be something for anyone who decides to listen through. 4 Stars.",2012-08-16,435,long,2012-08,music
US,51404825,R2X5X5MSRATZA2,B00A2KV7XW,495863035,Big Christmas Box,Digital_Music_Purchase,4,3,6,False,False,Amazing Collection of Classical and Traditional Christmas Songs but Beware the Castrati and Download Difficulties,"I love classical Christmas songs and carols, so this was an altogether amazing collection that I would have found to be a good value at 20x its price.  I found it a very fine collection of well-known traditional carols (Deck the Halls, Good King Wenceslas, Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, etc...) with numerous songs that were new to me, plus roughly 10-20% of the tracks were classical instrumentals (including  The Nutcracker and Handel's Messiah).  Many of the tracks are what one might imagine hearing a traditional choir sing in an 800+ year old cathedral in England.  Wonderful stuff to have playing in the background while putting up the tree or even just working at the office during the holiday season.  And an absolutely ridiculously good value at under a buck.<br /><br />So why the 1-star deduction down to a 4/5 rating?  Two reasons, chief of which is that roughly 10-15% of the songs on this boxset, including, unfortunately, some favorites, feature the solo singing of a particular male soprano.  It is not clear from the track credits, but I believe his name is Alfred Deller**.  Now I do not mind a choir featuring high-pitched boys or female sopranos, but this fellow is a full-grown man and is something else altogether.  He sounds like a castrati from a long-past era, but he trills some of his words and has a slight pitchiness to his beyond-15kHz warbling and crooning that grated on my nerves much akin to fingernails on a chalkboard.  Part of the problem is that he seems to sing from the back of his throat - imagine Kermit the Frog singing at 78rpm speed (for those of you old enough to remember when people had record players, not just esoteric, iconoclast audiophile turntables - for younger folks, try 3x speed).  My young daughter thought he sounded very funny and we all laughed when I said \""It sounds like his pants are way too tight.\""  Too often I found myself hitting the \""Next track\"" button on tracks where he sings.  If he was featured on only a few tracks, that would be a minimal issue, but he has several dozen tracks interspersed throughout this collection.  If I have time, I'll confirm which tracks feature this human parakeet and delete them.  There were also a few tracks that featured a narrator telling the story of Jesus, rather than any singing, and I'll delete those, as well.<br /><br />And that brings up the other issue:  as several others have complained, this collection was a difficult download and not just because of its size (although if I actually did download the whole collection to my computer, which I am not sure I was able to do, the file size was surprisingly small so these tracks appear to be rather compressed MP3 files and I was not overwhelmed by the audio quality when I listened via earphones).  I tried multiple times to download it to my laptop so that I could burn MP3 files to a disk for playback on my audio system, but for reasons I could not discern, never got it to download in a format that I could get Windows Media Player to recognize.  Finally, I resorted to dowloading it via the Amazon Android store to my Android smartphone and have been listening to it either with powered speakers plugged into my phone or with headphones.  I will try plugging my phone into the computer via USB cable, treating the phone's memory card as an external drive, and upload the MP3 files to my computer that way.  Hopefully I'll be able to do that so I can pare out the Alfred Deller tracks and turn this into a 100% pleasureable collection of music.<br /><br />=========================<br /><br />**  EDIT:  So I looked up Alfred Deller on Wikipedia and discovered that he was a well-known countertenor, which appears to be a polite way of saying male soprano who favors singing in a falsetto (just about my least favorite form of singing).  Here's what they have to say about it:<br /><br />\""A countertenor is a male singing voice whose vocal range is equivalent to that of a contralto, mezzo-soprano, or (less frequently) a soprano, usually through use of falsetto, or far more rarely, modal voice. A pre-pubescent male who has this ability is called a treble. This term is usually used in the context of the classical vocal tradition, although numerous popular music artists also prefer employing falsetto.<br /><br />\""The term first came into use in England during the mid 17th century, and was in wide use by the late 17th century. However, the use of adult male falsettos in polyphony, commonly in the alto range, was common in all-male sacred choirs for some decades previous, as early as the mid-16th century, and modern-day ensembles such as the Tallis Scholars and The Sixteen maintain the use of male altos in period works. During the Romantic period, the popularity of the countertenor voice waned and few compositions were written with that voice type in mind.<br /><br />\""In the second half of the 20th century, the countertenor voice went through a massive resurgence in popularity, partly due to pioneers such as Alfred Deller, by the increased popularity of Baroque opera and the need of male singers to replace the castrati roles in such works. Although the voice has been considered largely an early music phenomenon, there is a growing modern repertoire.\""",2012-12-03,904,extra_long,2012-12,music

If you have looked hard for Budgeting/Finance for the Mac, you know by now that the reviews of every product are all over the board. I looked at every level of software and found 1* - 5*, depending on expectations and the mood of the reviewer. This software genre was my last holdout from my Windows days.<br /><br />2nd, Quickens publicity issue with Mac users. As you also know, Quicken is one of the longterm leaders in Budgeting/Finance software. They are a highly advance company producing software that can run family finances as well as business finances and elaborate investment portfolios. Quicken within the last 2 years decided that they could not keep up with Windows advancements on the Mac (or that the smaller Mac customer base was not worth that grand effort). They started from scratch with Quicken Essentials and launched with a very Mac-like, but scaled down version. Without a doubt, the overwhelming amount of bad QE reviews come from advanced users who are grieving the advanced features they had known. I can't speak for Quicken, but I hope they continue to advance this product towards more advanced uses. After an exhaustive search, I decided on Quicken due to its known name & relationship with Financial institutions ... knowing I am only seeking family finance. With this said, I will avoid the usual criticism. I actually thought the more advanced Windows versions of Quicken were hard to understand (though I haven't used in over 5 years).<br /><br />Review:<br />Connections: Like others, I found that their connection to many investment accounts did not work as advertised, only connecting via Quicken-connect to about 40%. Because you can only get daily balances, it is hardly worth the effort. If you are wanting to manage your stocks, 401k, 403b, etc... This product is not for you at this time. However, I got great connections to my Bank accounts (my main concern). Now, with 1 click of a button I get immediate access to all of my checking/savinginformation ... much better than manual entry or saving files & importing.<br /><br />Interface: It is a very intuitive Mac interface with a lot of drag/drop benefits, easy to move around and see what you need to see. I like it.<br /><br />Banking: Downloads all transactions and gives a nice starting category to most transactions, and is learning quickly what I call things. I recommend spending as much time as possible right from the start getting categories the way you like, this will save a lot of future hassle.

She is Awesome!<br /><br />AWESOME story! Loved that ending! Gives it the possibility of a couple more stories for this series :) I don't think I could get tired of reading about these guys .. especially Seth :)<br /><br />Fun story! The beginning gets a little complicated with Cyborg getting the command to destroy ALL Cyborgs. At first X109GI couldn't comprehend why .. but being a Cyborg, he knew he shouldn't have to understand.<br /><br />Cyborgs were machines, Robots. Tools for human use. They might have started as flawed or damaged humans, but science and technology changed them.. Changed them and stole their memories. Along with their humanity, to make them into something the government could use to fight it's battles.<br /><br />But something happened... not all their Humanity was gone... not all their memories were wiped cleaned... so when the General ordered again for him to send out a wireless command to get all Cyborgs to the ship that will be destroyed, something snapped and X109GI knew he wasn't going to let it happen. and so did a few other Cyborgs.<br /><br />With the new order for the cyborgs to take over the ship and kill anyone who tried to stop them, the Cyborgs claimed their rights to live.<br /><br />Several years later , X109GI - aka GI Joe - was in his cell, arms above his head in chains and thick metal at his feet, followed by electric bars and force shields that couldn't hold him unless he wanted to.<br /><br />Escaping twice before, killing or harming those military doctors that came too close - He seems to love his job :)<br /><br />When Chloe came down to see the prisoner, she was so nervous. She had heard about people dying. The rules were simple.. Stay out of reach. Don't physically engage the prisoner. And if caught, prepare to die because the military did not negotiate with cyborgs.<br /><br />The credits in her account were going to be worth it though.<br /><br />Heading towards the cage, the guard on duty turned off the force shield and walked her forward, unlocking the cage.<br /><br />Before she was able to work up the nerve to step in, he backed himself up and put the force shield back up, blocking her in while he was safe on the other side.<br /><br />All she needed were a few samples.. blood and DNA. When she finally looked at the Cyborg, she had to remind herself he was just a machine, no real human could look that perfect.<br /><br />But when he looked up from his chains and met her eyes, the icy sneer on his face stopped her cold.<br /><br />There was a strange reaction from Joe's body when the tiny female walked into the cage. He couldn't figure out why his body was reacting to her this way. Sure he knew his body still functioned fully - most of the Cyborgs didn't want to bother with human females, he was one of them. So for his body to act so strongly towards her confused him more.<br /><br />He was thinking one thing, but as soon as he opened his mouth to talk to her, he couldn't help the inappropriate comments that came out of his mouth. The watch the blush on her cheeks...<br /><br />Chloe was curious about the Cyborgs. She knew some things, but it seemed that almost everything she was told about them was a lie. Or so he told her.<br /><br />As he talked, he felt the slight prick of the needle. Upset that she distracted him with her questions that she was able to get a sample out of him.<br /><br />When she turned around and walked away. Alone again with nothing but his own thoughts and plans to escape. But no matter which way his mind turned, it kept coming back to a pair of green eyes.<br /><br />The next day, Chloe came back down to the cell and talked to the Cyborg. She needed another sample. This time asking him nicely seemed to work in her favor.<br /><br />But her boss wanted more then his blood. He wanted a DNA sample.. when she asked for him to open his mouth, he told her she had to kiss him if she wanted his spit.<br /><br />Joe was determined to take this female with him when he escaped. It wasn't uncommon that the Cyborgs kidnapped women for their own sexual enjoyment. Many of the women they took weren't entirely grateful. He couldn't understand why, though. They brought their own children, or kidnapped children for the females. They gave them a house and so much more pleasure then a human male could possible give.. He had hopped Chloe would be happy with him.<br /><br />This was a great story! I thought at first it would be a lot like the Terminator, but it wasn't - These Cyborgs had a lot more humanity in them then even they knew about.<br /><br />There were some fun twists and turns towards the end.

Truth be told, if you use the methodology in this video to create an encounter with Sasquatch, you'll probably do more to frighten them off then anything else. These creatures are very timid and leery of humans, and when seeking to have an experience with them the last thing you want to do is make yourself appear threatening.<br /><br />So, when you start a search by discharging three rounds from your shotgun and then proceed to stomp around the woods in camouflage in an attempt to surprise them, both of which were illustrated in the video, your day of exploration might just end unsatisfactorily. Trust me, they will hear, see and smell you long before you will ever enter their immediate vicinity. From my successes, I deduced that the idea is to present yourself without any level of intimidation, and in as natural a way as possible. If you're fortunate, they will engage your presence with some level of contact. However, if they are not willing to oblige, then there is nothing you can do to change the fate of your efforts. One of the things that was accurately referred to in the video was the conceptualization that, \""you don't find Bigfoot, he finds you\"". Forever keep that in mind when trying to out think/out maneuver a creature that is bigger, faster, stronger and more instinctual than us. They are masters of their domain, and any attempt to aggressively pursue this creature will fully put on display the limitations of our species in their environment, and leave the researcher frustrated.<br /><br />What has worked for myself and many others, is to simply locate a documented area of high Sasquatch activity, leave your firearms and camouflage at home, and make yourself available for their curiosity. Become familiar with the basics of Sasquatch wood-knocks and vocalizations, and occasionally put those to use in an attempt to communicate with them. Now wait and be patient, because the rest will be up to them. Also, try and focus the majority of your efforts on nighttime forays. They are well aware that humans cannot see well at night, while they have the vision of an animal designed to function in a nocturnal environment. This has often emboldened them to engage us at much closer proximities in the darkness, then comparatively in the light.<br /><br />In conclusion, the people of this documentary are probably good natured and well intentioned in their efforts.

Typing has its disadvantages, especially that it's sometimes distracting, but using a stylus and touch pad could very well solve that.<br /><br />A particular disadvantage with using Audio Note is that often I will be pre-organizing my notes spacially on the paper, but being able to hear the section of the meeting corresponding to any note I took in the software -- this trumps the advantage of the notepad.<br /><br />It's great to see I can go in after the fact and edit the notes (spelling, expanding, etc.), and / or I can copy my notes to some other application to organize and make use of them.<br /><br />OH!

Together they play an intense and exciting blend of roots music, jazz-folk fusion and Middle Eastern and North African styles. They're both experienced musicians with a wealth of know-how picked up in solo shows, session work, and various groups and orchestras.<br /><br />They explain that the \""Moor\"" in their name refers to both the moors of the British Isles, and the Moors of North Africa, and that's reflected in the music they make. Haines' songs are very much part of the western tradition, a style that's rooted in the folk music of Britain and Ireland, and it's the instrumentation they sporadically apply which provides the exoticism.<br /><br />The bass and mandolin of opening track \""Break It Down\"" is as straightforward as they get, though there's no denying either the performance or the quality of the song. There's something of a stripped back R.E.M. to their sound, and by the time the cello arrives they've already more than made their point. This is serious music, and \""Li Sula\"" confirms both their ambition and the talent to make it work. Largely instrumental, its ethereal qualities and lateral, non-western structure is utterly enthralling.

Funky, gritty as the inside of a free range oyster's shell, JLH Jr. depicts her escape from the hum-drum to the walk on the wild side with such poignancy that it almost hurts to listen to.<br /><br />Mr. Lucky Peterson sits in on `You Be My Hero' and bringing with him some electrifying guitar work. A tribute to all the men and women of the armed forces it is a genuine, heart felt song that is funky as it is real. Excellent horn work through out the release by the Hot Sauce Horns arranged by Larry Batiste and featuring such luminaries as Tom Poole, Doug Rowan and Ric `Mighty Bone' Feliciano and others.<br /><br />Some New Orleans second line gets the Hooker treatment in \""Listen To The Music' a sing along chorus nails it down and he even gives us a \""how-how/bow-wow\"". If ya gotta ask then ya just don't know, but when you hear it you will get it.<br /><br />A very special appearance by `The Cleanup Woman', Ms. Betty Wright on the track track `I Surrender'.

Ms. Wright's saucy vocals and Mr. Hooker's gritty intonations combine in a dynamic song that had me chair dancing till I realized that people could see me thru the window - so I got up and shook that thing.<br /><br />For the `purists' out there `Hard Times' and \""Let Me Be' will make you very comfortable in your corner of the room. On the former we are treated to some incendiary guitar work by John Garcia and stellar harp work that recalls Little Walter by Dave Barrette. `Hard Times' is so stunning and real that it shakes the foundation of life's simple structure - Mr. Hooker's lyrics are truthful, painful and pull no punches. All I can say is that I am glad you are here for us and not where you were headed.<br /><br />Since I mentioned it `Let Me Be' is a super funky plea to do just that. Mr. Hooker's vocals have a certain `old school' quality to them they remind me of Lou Rawls at times and that's not a bad thing.

The trials and tribulations that he experienced as the son of such an iconic blues man is presented here in a direct point making song with a funky dance groove that is at once sad but ultimately redeeming. Mr. Hooker gives testimony, praise and thanks to the all powerful one yet we also see how the title has several applications in his life.<br /><br />This is a stunning release one that I believe should garner serious consideration for Grammy's and Blues Music Awards.<br /><br />Being All Hooked Up is a good thang, get on that road by visiting blues411.com for an interview with John Lee Hooker, Jr.at it shakes the foundation of life's simple structure - Mr. Hooker's lyrics are truthful, painful and pull no punches.

I should have known better. Intuit is marketing a product that nearly everyone is causing nearly everyone hours of frustration. I spend three hours with it and I am done. I purchased this through Amazon as a download. If they do not issue a refund very quickly . . . notice I said very quickly . . . I will begin pursuing a class-action lawsuit against them. Anyone care to join? I find it interesting that nearly every major software manufacturer out there . . . even those producing suites that cost $1500 (Adobe) offer at least a 15 day trial (most are 30 days) of their product at no charge. You only pay at the end of the trial period if you like your experience. Yet Intuit does not offer such a program (at least not one that I am aware of). So . . . since Intuit monitors these reviews, I pose the question . . . Why do you not offer a trial period for your software? (I think everyone that has bought their flawed product already knows the answer.)  Considering how many problems there are with this product, I almost consider their sale of this software \""bait-and-switch.\"" I have worked with computers and software for more than 30 years. I have bought lots of software. Never have I seen such an irresponsible release of a product that is still in the developmental stage Problem is, Intuit doesn't understand that. They are so inept at understanding the functionality of their product they think it is a \""prime time\"" piece of work. There should be some people losing their jobs over this fiasco. Stay posted. I will keep everyone advised on how they handle my request for a refund. It is my opinion that Amazon should pull Quicken 2013 from their product offerings. I will let you know what their response is to that suggestion.<br /><br />Update 10/18<br />Well I have to give credit to Intuit for following through so quickly on my dissatisfaction with Quicken 2013. I literally got an e-mail from them within hours of my post . . . very impressive. And I could tell there was definitely a genuine apologetic tone to their response.I had used Quicken for nearly 15 years, but went a new direction about five years ago so I could have connectivity to my smartphone. So I was really excited when I heard about the 2013 version. Anyway . . . looks like I am back to Mvelopes. Thanks Intuit to getting my problem squared away. (Issuing a refund). Well done!<br /><br />Update 11/8  Heard that all the bugs which drove me to request a refund have supposedly been resolved. So . . . I will give them one more try. I used to be a user of Quicken 2010 before switching to Mvelopes. Not a lot new in Quicken 2013, but since I am operating my own business, I will give Quicken's Home & Business a try. If things go well, I will probably use both Mvelopes & Quicken. May be buying it all over again.<br /><br />Update 11/11<br />I have now been using Quicken 2013 for nearly a week. This has been a start over experience after my very disappointing first date with the product several weeks back which prompted me to ask for a refund. I like how things are going. I had been a long time Quicken user, but had jumped ship about three years ago in pursuit of a financial tool that had a good Android app. Over the years, I think I have tried nearly everything YNAB, Moneydance, Pocketsmith, Yodlee, etc. I have finally settled on two programs Mvelopes and Quicken 2013 Home and Office. I will continue to use Mvelopes because it provides a great weekly budget option . . . Quicken does not. But I have always loved the customization features of Quicken that helps me see the info the way I want it. And I like the ability to use my finance app offline as well as online. People (including myself) are highly opinionated about their finance software. Everyone has their own particular way theywant the information about their bank accounts and budget to be managed. After having been around the block with nearly 10 - 12 different finance apps, I have concluded that Quicken is one of the best for my family situation. If quicken had a weekly budgeting feature, I would drop Mvelopes and be all in with Intuit. Quicken is not perfect, but I am still glad to be back with Quicken.

Ms. Fisher and Mr. Guglielmo have written a fascinating narrative of a fascinating character, \""Tania Head,\"" who perpetrated and unimaginable fraud on New York 9-11 survivors and the American people.<br /><br />Most of the book is devoted to Ms. Head's ascendency within the WTC Survivors Network and her leadership of this organization.  She told a horrific and inspiring tale of personal loss while [ruthlessly one might say] adopting the role of victim, survivor, organizer, and leader - none of it true.  Ironically, she does a lot of good on the macro level along the way and a good bit of harm on a personal level to those closest to her.<br /><br />This book evoked an enormous range of emotions.  We all have been personally touched in one way or another by 9/11, and it is hard not to take Ms. Head's fraud personally and condemn her.  It is as if she has stolen from us, and her lies steal from and mock the true heroes and victims.  Yet, at other times, it is hard not to feel sorry for her and her pathetic, if not pathological, need for attention.  Indeed, she is clearly emotionally unbalanced or worse.<br /><br />I found myself asking myself how this could happen.  Did a \""small\"" lie snowball out of control or was Ms. Head's goal always to rise to such prominence?  How could her fraud go undetected so long; did we all have an emotional need for the kind of person she claimed to be?  Was she our adopted, or surrogate, survivor?  How can one look at oneself in the mirror in the morning knowing you are the embodiment of fraud committed on those most vulnerable - those who really did survive and adapt to the events of 9-11.<br /><br />If I have one criticism of the book it is that it left me wanting more.  I wish Mr. Guglielmo had indeed obtained that last interview.  Perhaps also the input of a psychologist - \""profiling\"" what type of person, with what disorders) could possiblydo such a thing - would have been a nice addition.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this compelling read.",2012-04-18,374,long,2012-04,ebooks

Go ahead...with my blessing. Really.<br /><br />But if you prefer intelligent cinema that at least tries to make a feeble stab at realism, read on.<br /><br />Let's start with the premise: Snow White and the Huntsman is a modern remake  of the classic fairy tale. When you hear of this flick, you might immediately think of the happy-go-lucky, innocent Snow White of Disney fame and assume a 2012 version with awesome special effects might actually have a chance of being interesting. Well, you'd be wrong.<br /><br />For the first fifteen minutes or so, I truly wanted to believe in this story, but the film let me down so far that by the end I was rolling on the floor in a mixture of agony and laughter.<br /><br />The hints at Norse and Celtic cultures used in both the costumes and sets seemed promising. However, the production department just couldn't decide whether this \""Kingdom\"" was in 14-century France or 8th-century Denmark. The result is a motley visual melee of boots, longbow archers, cleavage-baring dresses with feathers pasted on, and glistening armor that Lancelot himself would have envied.<br /><br />When we first see Snow White, she's a miracle girl born to previously childless parents who can't be more pleased. Why shouldn't they? After all, they got exactly what they ordered--a beautiful, blue-eyed girl with red lips and shiny black hair. She's good, kind to animals and plays outdoors. Young Snow White (Raffey Cassidy) made a credibly beautiful, lively princess. Understandably, I had high hopes for the role of the older Snow White.<br /><br />In keeping with the legend, Snow's mother bites the dust and her father is left suitably aggrieved. Because of his newfound emotions, he's goaded into battle with some mysterious soldiers in a forest. It turns out these soldiers have a `hostage'--Ravenna (Charlize Theron). He's so `fascinated' by her beauty thathe doesn't think twice about her background and brings her to the castle straightaway, Trojan-horse style. After Snow's father has been duped into marrying the lissome blonde, at bedtime she hisses some very unladylike verbiage into his ear then stabs poor King Magnus to death. Evidently his crime was to feel desire for a beautiful woman, which according to the Fem Lit major Ravenna, is punishable by death. Hands off the merchandise!<br /><br />The next segment is quite standard and tired--Ravenna steals the throne, kills all Magnus' nobles and slap Snow White into prison for looking too beautiful. Ravenna's dislike of men doesn't stop her from using her brother as her personal punching bag, either. Theron's performance is OK--with that deep sinister voice, she's maniacal, all right. But we scarcely get a glimpse at her vulnerable side, the side that must have kept her from killing Snow outright in the first place. That's partly due to a script flaw. Horror, pain, suffering, etc, under Queen Ravenna. Yawn.<br /><br />Enter our languishing heroine (Kristen Stewart), who suffers an untold number of years in her lonely tower, watching lovely maidens have the youth sucked out of them by Snow's stepmother, all from a distance. With stringy black hair in a perpetual side-part and eyes that rarely open past half-drugged slits; ridiculous poufy sleeves and rather tomboyish leggings, Stewart's grungy Snow White is far from impressive. You're left asking--this is the fairest of them all? Right. You decide Ravenna really doesn't have that much to be worried about.<br /><br />After mumbling the Lord's prayer (this is a Christian kingdom??) in tortuous English dialects and petting her straw dolls in the shape of her parents, Snow White decides she'd rather not have her youth sucked out, thank you very much. It's jailbreak time. Our innocent-turned-commando slashes her jailer with a rusty nail and flees the castle by executing a perfect softball slide into the underground sewer.Not the most romantic of escapes, but there you are.<br /><br />After diving in to the ocean and avoiding being killed by rocks and surf, Snow White happens upon a horse awaiting her on the beach. (Guess the color of this horse---yep, white.) Interestingly, she has not forgotten how to ride during her long years of imprisonment, and lithely hops on and heads for the dark forest. On the way she rides straight into a bog, inhales a few magic mushrooms and eventually collapses in a writhing ball and passes out in what is commonly known as a side effect of consuming hallucinogenic fungi. Survival school rating: Fail.<br /><br />But wait---we've forgotten the other title character. Dear old Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) is living is squalor, having no other defined skills except drinking and well...the other thing that comes after drinking. He likes to brawl, too, just like a good savage ought. Apparently he is also a tolerably good tracker--just the sort the queen needs. Ravenna's lap dog manages to douse the inebriated Huntsman in ice water and haul him before the royal presence, where he in informed he will have to retrieve the bad little escapee.<br /><br />With the Huntsman's undefined prowess at work, it takes him approximately five seconds to track down Snow, implausibly overcoming a day's gap and miles between him and his quarry. Since the queen ticked him off by mentioning she could resurrect his dead wife as a form of payment, Huntsman suddenly decides he might not finish the job, after all.<br /><br />It's clear that Hemsworth is still in the Thor frame of mind. He swings his axe with the same fervor as he did Mjolnir, expect the Hunstman's axe doesn't shoot lightning or send enemies flying hundreds of feet away. Either of the qualities might have helped the fellow actually win a bout.<br /><br />Even deprived of his usual good-hygiene, Hemsworth is the first appealing character this viewer has seen for the entire film. At last she has a face to pair with the pointless voice-over narration. She can even excuse his attempt at a rather corrupted Scottish dialect and decided mad-on. Why? Because Hemsworth brings something to the screen Stewart can't--chemistry. Despite his best attempts, every romantic scene deadpans out because of Stewart's miserable delivery and lack of a softer side. I don't mean helpless female. I mean feminine. Snow White's mother wanted her daughter to be as delicate and as hardy as a winter rose. That's what Snow should have been, if she hadn't been too busy being caught between Amazon and peabrain.<br /><br />When you take away Snow White's beauty, innocence, and kindness, what do you have left? Answer: a modern-day Boadicea, without the hard past and military skills to back it up. It's a pathetic substitution.<br />If I was a soldier waiting to receive orders from my leader, the last thing I'd want is a harridan in a white nightgown screeching about how excited I should be about assailing an impenetrable fortress. This Snow seems to place zero value on life, unless it's stroking a large stag (white again) beneath a tree covered with sprites. Then she gets to be upsets when some rude twit puts an arrow in it.<br /><br />This stag, by the way, seemed to be an allusion to the Celtic god Herne, though of course no explanation of this factoid is given in the film. One is left to assume the director spent a good deal of time watching The Hooded Man, which would, incidentally, explain the presence of Ray Winstone in dwarven form. Actually, I found the dwarves the most enjoyable group because they could act.<br /><br />I won't even go into the fallacies of the final battle scene that seemed ripped off from Robin Hood, except to point out that Snow, who proclaimed earlier not to hate Ravenna, comes in with sword a-swinging to deal the final blow.  And then, at her coronation, Snow doesn't even give as much as a nod of acknowledgement to the Huntsman. Most women under the age of dead would act like they've been struck by Cupid's Arrow after getting a kiss from that guy. They'd be inseparable. Together forever.  End of story. But all Snow can do is cry and gasp like a fish out of water. Graceful? I think not.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Huntsman wins the Last Man Standing Award. He smiles tolerantly through Snow's screeching speech. He fights for Snow's life time and time again. He's clearly in need of a relationship. Therefore he deserves the hand of the queen if he wants it. But Hemsworth and the scriptwriter make it clear he doesn't.  It makes you want to knock some sense into Snow for dissing Huntsman for wishy-washy William.<br /><br />That's why this story is all about Snow White. She had no fulfilled love interests, no friends and no future. Snow is worse that naïve and impractical--she has no spine. If there ever was a waste of a good legend, it's this one. It could have been a grown-up version of the children's classic--sexy, powerful, emotionally charged. The perfect male lead was there. So was the funding, the CGI, and the scenery. Purely because of Kristen Stewart and a script as flimsy as her fighting skills, Snow White and the Huntsmen falls flat on its face and directly into a mud puddle.",2012-10-12,1552,extra_long,2012-10,videos

We've been Mac users for more than a decade and our business is set up on Macs...  I have to say, though, that if I had to do this over, I would convert to PCs (as frustrating as I find them) simply because that's the standard.  No business is an island, and being \""better\"" is no good if you can't get decent products or connect with other people.  I looked into running parallels and some version of windows and QB2012 for PC, but that is a hassle and expense I didn't want to do, plus it opens your Mac up to PC viruses.  I think maybe the right choice would have been to have just not bought the Mac, and reverted to a PC for the business, though.  The Mac version of QuickBooks is shamefully crippled compared to its PC counterparts.  We have a VERY simple business, but we've already run into shortcomings.  Among others--no way to track assets and depreciation?  Are you kidding?  I have to run a separate excel file and manually track depreciations, then manually transfer that info into a jerry-rigged depreciation expense account and debit the asset?  REALLY?!  This has been in the PC version FOREVER.  Also, you'll find most of the support is geared towards the PC version, so you'll read instructions to go under such a tab and choose this, and lo and behold, it's not present on your version!  Ooops!  You don't get that feature!<br /><br />We upgraded to this product from an old version of Quicken (06) and found the transfer a little buggy, but knew to expect that--the categories transferred correctly, but we lost all of the info in the notes/memo.  This meant that I could run a report to see how much I spent on building repair in 2010, but I can't see the explanations for what that money went to.  This only applies to the transfer from Quicken, though.  Using QB2012 is easy if you're used to computer accounting, quicken, etc.  Some of the terms and structures are different, but it's not hard to transition.  The program does occasionally freeze, making me force-quit out and re-enter, which I find sort of amateur on a new program running on a new machine, but usually you've only lost the most recent entry.  On a related note, in case you're considering whether a Mac is a feasible business computer, also know that TurboTax Small Business doesn't have a Mac version, PERIOD.  The \""Home and Business\"" does, but if you have a multi-member LLC, you need the \""Small Business\"", which is PC only.  Bummer.  We were able to successfully export our QB for Mac file to a QB for PC file to take to an accountant at tax time without a hitch, though.  She said it looked different than the PC files, but the data interacted correctly.  Bottom line:  If you're committed to Macs and won't consider changing, you've already made your bed, so buy this software and move on.  If there's any way to accept that the momentum of the conventional business world (PCs) has already made the choice for you and you're just going to have to move to the dark side and run PCs, you'll have an easier life for it.",2012-04-27,556,extra_long,2012-04,software

However, the strong racers usually survive and eventually thrive in these intense Belgian competitions returning to America as professional cyclists.  Interesting, insightful and informative Daniel Lee's THE BELGIAN HAMMER: FORGING YOUNG AMERICANS INTO PROFESSIONAL CYCLISTS keeps you clicking through the cogs as the key races he describes reach critical mass and the young Americans display their raw talent: Displays like Ben King's dramatic breakaway win of the 115 mile US Pro Road Race Championship or Taylor Phinney's US Pro Time Trial Championship win in Greenville in September 2010.  This book describes contemporary American youths' racing experiences -- mostly young men based in Belgium, the groundzero of introductory European style racing -- and how these young guns master the skills needed to successfully ride their way into the future; a future in racing that unfortunately only rewards a very select few.  It tells the story of the developmental programs and their primary importance in creating a reality where young American racers can focus on their racing leaving most of the logistics of living in Belgium to others, who just happen to double as coaches.  Reading THE BELGIAN HAMMER makes you want to yank your bike off the trainer and peel off down the road regardless of the fact that the roads are snow-covered and temperatures are in single digits.

There were only two stories I thoroughly enjoyed, most I read and thought had merits but was frustrated with overall and one  made me so mad I skipped it. The bios for the authors were insanely long, something that was made far more apparent by the Kindle's format, one was even longer than the story it was there for. The interviews were alright I guess but I felt like the interviewers spent too much time trying to make themselves look and seem like they were the most awesome thing ever. I felt like the reviews were poorly selected, I usually enjoy reading reviews of movies and books but when you have a review of a book that's more than 30 years old you have to stop and ask yourself why even include it. And the section at the end where the writers explained where the ideas for their stories came from seemed like an exercise in self-love. I don't know that ANY story merits a full explanation for its origins but certainly not some that may or may nor go anywhere in the next ten years. It felt like the editor and publisher felt they were more important than they are.<br /><br />I can't complain TOO loudly, I didn't pay much for it and clearly many other people enjoyed this issue.

I figured that I would wait until the price had dropped significantly and it had been \""fully\"" reviewed before possibly buying it.  I had gotten so tired of \""just another FPS\"" - roaming around waiting for a head to pop up, interspersed with occasionally interesting (but largely unnecessary) cut scenes.<br /><br />But then Amazon offered the download at half-off, so I went ahead and dove in.  What I found was way beyond what I expected!!!<br /><br />Is this a great FPS?  Not really - it is a pretty linear; the AI ranges from great to iffy, and there is not a lot of weapon selection or customization if that is your bag of tricks.  I would never give it 5 stars for its FPS gameplay.<br /><br />But, the good stuff starts with the visuals and the audio (especially the music).  I was traveling, so I played it on a laptop with the minimum graphics card - a Radeaon 2600 - and it was still stunning!!! (I could even play with the graphics dialed up a little and experience no skipping.)  Meanwhile, the sound effects and music give you the creepy feeling of actually being stuck in this surreal level of Dante's Inferno - even when the background music gives way to classic rock, it only adds to that feel.  Back to visuals, Dubai retains its splendor while looking very believably damaged by the sandstorms that give this game its background.  Visuals and audio would at least get a 4 star rating in my opinion.<br /><br />But those graphics and audio are almost simply a small part of what makes this game great!  You ARE there inside the game, experiencing this challenging moral quagmire as though you were really in it.  Uniforms and wounds look worse and worse, and the characters (both yours and the NPCs) slip further and further into darkness.  Sometimes, it gets a little weird (especially toward the end), but somehow it all works - and works well!<br /><br/>This is not your little brother's video game; this is a walk into darkness - it is war, so gun play is of course a part; it is moving you toward a conclusion, so it can be linear at times.

I was very happy to see a \""local\"" campaign mission, instead of the all spanning global battlefields in Rome and Empire. Additionally, the concept of moving to a whole new theater type, moving away from a Europe central game was interesting.<br /><br />However, the gameplay took the rating from a solid 4.5 to a mere 2 since it is very USER UNFRIENDLY.<br /><br />Quickview Pros:<br />-New take on TW with units, \""local\"" campaign, and \""Siege\""-style naval warfare<br />-Stability far improved on newer systems than Empire TW<br />-Decent expansion pack opportunities<br /><br />-\""Drop in\"" battle against online opponents<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Nightmare to control land and naval battles<br />-Units are unclear on their purpose, strengths and weaknesses<br />-Unit replenishment takes longer and is no longer player controlled<br />-New defense requires ALL control points be held by defender constantly, loss of one means loss of the battle.<br /><br />Technical Stuff:<br />The game is FAR FAR more stable right out of the gate then Empire was. My system is top-spec and had problems getting Empire to run, and had to be rolled back. Not a problem with Shogun, everything worked as advertised right off the bat.<br /><br />Campaign Gameplay:<br />-The campaign is more of the same from TW, again though, the campaign (and battle) controls have been tweaked just enough around the HUD for there to be disorientation when you switch from Rome, or Empire. I was not a fan of the constantly retooled HUD, since it makes swapping game to game more difficult for loyal players.<br />-The campaign elements are also slightly different, there aren't \""outlying towns\"" anymore than get built up, but you earn spaces inside your cities for you to build a variety of buildings on. There's more selections per space, but you won't be constantly looking for outlying, undeveloped areas.<br />-The campaign map also does away with repairing units directly. There's no more clicking \""rearm, retrain, restaff\"" unit and it just happens, now units have to sit and wait to naturally be retrained with new men. This can be annoying to those of us used to hell on wheels marches with massive land armies.<br /><br />Battle Gameplay:<br />-Land armies are nightmarishly hard to learn. In creating a game without \""supreme units\"" the designers have created units that seem unable to fight. No units seem to be very good at anything, and it seems to come down to massive bouts of throwing miscellaneous troops into warfare. The addition of tiered unit types using Japanese names, rather than easier to understand \""veteran\"" units or \""light infantry\"" and \""heavy infantry\"" designators just makes things harder on the player.<br /><br />-Naval Battles have completely declined into morasses of ships bumping into one another. Whereas Empire introduced naval warfare as a great and vibrant new field along with ships that could fight well, the ships in Shogun are are better left to fight \""auto-resolve\"" as controlling them in any meaningful way is daunting. I relished in naval battles in Empire, but hung-up my admiral's hat in Shogun for \""auto-resolve\"" unless I had cannon ships.<br /><br />-Defense in depth has become the word in laying siege to a city, or defending. The cities now are completely surroundable by the advanced AI of the game, and instead of high walls and towers/cannon you have tiered plateaus guarded by infantry, and occasionally oddly placed defensive buildings. Gates are good defenses, but walls are easily walked right over by infantry. Also gone are the \""take and hold the town-square\"" style battles, in favor of multiple positions around the town. I found it annoying to hold 5 of 6 positions, including the town center, and lose because I was repulsed off one defense position. Combine this with the nightmare of land armies smashing into one another, and defense against siege is just an annoyingly complex task, ill representing any of the players skill in the game.<br /><br />All in all I was very disappointed in the direction Shogun 2 took, and I find myself replaying Empire, Rome and Medieval Total War instead of bothering with the headaches of Shogun 2.",2012-02-16,684,extra_long,2012-02,games

Although the gameplay itself does not quite present anything new, it tells a great story accompanied by a varied and beautiful soundtrack.<br /><br />1. Story: 10/10<br /><br />The story is highly original by video game standards (although it has been seen in a very popular movie and a classic book). The writers, however, did an amazing job at adapting it for a modern day combat situation, the pace is perfect, the tone is extremely dark. Overall, it's just extremely thought provoking: as a soldier in Delta Force, it's up to you and your squad to evacuate the city of Dubai after it has been pummeled by monstrous sandstorms for the past six months. However, as you get deeper into the city, you realize the situation isn't as cut-and-dry as you thought, and it will come down to you to make some tough decisions. The story primarily unfolds as you progress through the game, giving you no additional information outside of what your character sees and hears. However, there are a few \""intelligence items\"" scattered throughout each level, ranging from tape recordings to dolls, which provide additional (often chilling) narration and back story to the already emotionally charged atmosphere.<br /><br />2. Gameplay: 7/10<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Gameplay is the weakest part of this Game. It's just generic compared to other titles in the genre; run behind cover, take shots at the enemy, find your next cover position, etc. You're limited to two weapons, with an available assortment of P90's, UMP-45's, Scout Sniper Rifles, M249's, SCAR-H's, etc, which you'll need to loot from your dead enemies. You're teamed up with two squadmates, but only have very limited control over them, which reduces any strategic element the game may have had. Sand plays an important role in the game, and in every level there's an opportunity to bury your opponents, or at the very least kick up a cloud of sand to slow them down. There's really not much else to expand on here. You'll never encounter any puzzles, annoying quick-time-events or deep planning, although sometimes you do find a random flanking position and are able to sweep the enemies.<br /><br />The checkpoint system could have been improved upon, also. Before  many of the battles, there's a cutscene. If you die, guess where the checkpoint takes you.... Right back to the cutscene. It's easy enough to double tap Enter to skip it, but it regrettably and unnecessarily adds to the loading time of the battle again.<br /><br />Controls are a bit sluggish. It can be somewhat difficult to maneuver your character around the battlefield. Detaching from cover is often much easier than it should be, which can make you accidentally exposed to enemy fire. Sometimes you'll be trying to run away from a grenade and accidentally duck behind the wrong side of a car... These kinds of things are minor annoyances in the grand scheme of things, but they do happen and they do frustrate from time to time unless you get a good feel for it.<br />I do recommend changing the default controls as soon as possible, though, as they don't really feel all that intuitive. Also, as of the time of writing this review, I noticed the Mouse Sensitivity settings didn't really seem to change anything. At the default level, the sensitivity felt too high for me, and at the lowest setting, it felt exactly the same... I don't know if that's just my impression or something that needs to be patched. Again, minor nuisance, as you'll get used to it.<br /><br />3. Sound: 9.5/10<br /><br />The sound here is amazing. Voices are clean and crisp and the radio filters on voices are spot on. The soundtrack is perfect, featuring modern day rock, custom compositions and classic 70's hits. The music always seems to fit the battle to which it's playing, too. The only reason I refrain from giving it higher than a 9.5 is that the sound effects you're likely to hear most often, the gunshots, soundsomewhat silly to me. Now, I've only fired a few weapons in real life, and never the M4, but I'm fairly certain it doesn't sound like a laser... One of those things that you get used to after a couple of levels, though. There were also a couple instances where cutscene audio just did not play for me. I know it may be my system, but the other cutscenes loaded just fine.<br /><br />4. Graphics: 8.5/10<br /><br />The visuals themselves (the destroyed Dubai cityscape surrounded by an impossibly high mountain of sand, the aquarium with swimming fish, etc.) are awe inspiring and perfectly complement the storyline. But, like the gunshot audio complaint I have, the things you look at the most are just unimpressive. Character models are bland and lacking fine detail (though they did a good job of showing just how progressively beat up your character and squadmates are as you move through the story). The same thing can be said of many of the textures in the game. Maybe it's a stylistic effect of the designers, but there are times when the world around you looks like GTA Vice City when you're going 60 MPH down the road, and there are times when it makes you feel like you're actually there. It's hard to tell if that's the effect they were going for, to suspend your disbelief, or... if they just figured it was dark enough and that they didn't need to waste time.<br />I mentioned earlier that sand plays an important role in the game... and, it looks beautiful when it's burying an enemy alive, or when your grenade kicks up a cloud of it into the air.<br /><br />All in all, this game is highly worth getting, especially if you can look past the mundane gameplay and concentrate on the story. It will make you think, and it will make you feel.",2012-07-04,995,extra_long,2012-07,games

My tax returns were very simple back then but they got more and more complicated with each passing year to the point where it took days to complete, especially after it took weeks of free time compiling the data necessary to support each deduction in preparation for my first of three subsequent tax audits.<br /><br />After those three audits, spread out over a five-year period, one of which cost me money due to my selection of the wrong depreciation schedule out of a gazillion options, and two of which actually led to missed deductions that resulted in additional refunds for a significant net gain, doing my own taxes became a relentless chore that I no longer enjoyed.<br /><br />Then 12 years ago my youngest son brought home a copy of H&R Block Home and Business software and doing my own taxes has become a breeze ever since. Oh, I still have to compile the data, which other software helps me do, but the H&R Block Home and Business Federal and State software incorporates all the latest changes in the tax codes, asks all the right questions, puts all the numbers in all the right places, selects all the right forms, transfer all the right data for the state return, electronically files the returns with the IRS and state taxing bodies, and populates the next year's tax returns with the necessary data to begin the process all over again.<br /><br />The fact that I have not had a tax audit since I began using H&R Block Home and Business software (most recently H&R Block At Home 2010 Premium & Business Federal + State + eFile) doesn't mean I won't undergo one in the future, during which I'll have to justify this deduction orthat interpretation of the tax code. But I do know that I won't have to justify the forms I used, the application of the extremely complicated tax laws, or the math calculations, all of which would have taken days to figure out instead of the minutes it takes H&R Block Home and Business software to accomplish.<br /><br />Personally speaking, after using H&R Block Home and Business software for that past dozen years, I can't imagine doing it any other way and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is doing their taxes on their own. And if you're starting out like I did lo those many years ago, begin with the appropriate H&R Block tax software package. Believe me, you'll discover tax forms, deductions, and credits you never thought of, and you'll be embarking on a lifelong program that'll ensure your tax returns are done right in a fraction of the time it'll take yu to do on your own or the fees it'll cost to have someone else do them for you.<br /><br />And, finally, buying and dowloading the software on Amazon.com ensures you get the best price and service available.",2012-05-27,549,extra_long,2012-05,software

I purchased H&R Block version at a great price via Amazon promotion (I thought). However, I got lost in the area of Passive Activity Loss Limitations (deals w/ a rental).  The program required I print out reading material and complete worksheets before I continue.  Typically, the program works you through this and doesn't have you do this kind of stuff outside the program.  Besides the program was very confusing.  I tried to return the program and found out you can't.  I then purchased Turbo Tax (twice as expensive) via Amazon and worked through and finished my return.  As a non tax pro, I understand that the Passive Activity Loss Limitation doesn't apply to me because I didn't have enough of a loss or make too much in income for a reduction in loss to apply in my situation for 2011.  Sorry I can't explain details...  Turbo Tax Premier Ed was much better for me. Maybe H & R Block has come out with a fix/update?  I have one rental property.  I believe if I didn't have the loss in 2010 for the rental property this program would have worked fine.  Turbo Tax was slick and more user friendly.

So my mind began to hunger for a wild flesh eating ride, spiced with sarcasm and maybe some well placed gore.  What did I get instead - boring teenage complaint after complaint set against the backdrop of an idea that seemed cool yet not well realized.  What seemed to be the main focus of the excerpt was the teenage angst heard over and over again in popular media.  It became boring real fast.  The narration was an overplayed attempt to symbolize the way teenagers speak so much that eventually I forgot it was narration and thought I was reading an overly long quote that never stopped!  I have the fear that this story will center more on the teenage angst than the zombies, or will blend the two so that neither stand out.  There are so many stories on teenage angst, and this one seems lost in the pile.  The idea of a drug made from zombie brains is exciting especially considering most zombie lore states that zombies have nothing in their brains worth anything (this concept puts a new spin on zombie fantasies), but if it were a focus why only mention it in the end of the excerpt and not ride with it from the beginning? At the end of the excerpt I did not learn anything about the 'Vitamin Z', or why the zombies were there in the first place - that was a let-down.  The action seemed to appear for a split second and offered some relief, especially when the head came flying off the zombie, but it wasn't enough to make me want to read any more.

Ram is a young man and heir to his lands. His father arranges his marriage to a Norman noblewoman, Mabelle. Unfortunately, Ram has no desire to marry, especially a woman he hasn't seen. He'd rather follow his lord, William, Duke of Normandie to England.<br /><br />On his way home to be married, Ram finds a woman laying in the grass coved by bluebells near a lake. It's Mabelle. Both parties mistake the scene. Ram returns to his castle and delays the wedding, insulting Mabelle and her father. Within months he leaves to accompany William to England.<br /><br />War gives Ram a different perspective on life and he comes to realize what a real gem he had found in Mabelle. William gives Ram land in the Welsh Marches. Ram inspects his land and is injured by a Welsh Prince, Rhodri. As Ram recovers in the home of a Saxon noblewoman, he finds comfort in her arms. Once he's well again, he goes to Normandie intent on winning Mabelle's heart, but will his past actions and previous reluctance make going forward with his life a duty without pleasure or will he find true passion?<br /><br />Markland has done her research and it shows. The setting's authentic feel makes the reader believe they're a squire in Ram's care along for the ride. The author uses a good economy of words to paint vivid descriptions of the time. The plot moves at a nice pace, never lingering.<br />The characters are interesting and likable. Mabelle is loyal and honest and it's easy to identify with her. Ram embodies a soldier of the time, confident and heroic, but fickle when it comes to listening with his heart. The supporting cast of characters helps to round out the story and give the novel it's epic effect.<br /><br />For me, the story feels more like the beginning of a family saga than a historical romance, since Ram is not faithful in deeds to Mabelle.

However, I am completely fed up with having this kid being shoved in my face, and having to hear a number of his songs from this album against my will. Not only that, but I am sick and tired of hearing him get way too much undue praise, even being referred to as \""this generation's big musician.\"" Yes, G. Issacs, I am talking about you! Being a music aficionado with a collection of well over 700 CDs (and counting), I am by no means biased or closed-minded. You don't have to be biased or closed-minded in order to speak out against a hack like Justin Bieber. If anything, it is the other way around.<br /><br />Honestly, despite the fact that this album is distinctively different from his earlier releases, I really have to put my foot down on what so many of these \""Beliebers\"" have been saying. Ask yourselves: What is so special and unique about him? How is he any different from anyone else whose songs are played on contemporary radio? I'll bet anything that NO ONE in the right mind will be able to think of anything to support these claims. The fact is this: He is merely the latest incarnation of the same, generic love song formula that has been in place ever since N'Sync, Backstreet Boys and NKOTB, if not earlier.<br /><br />This kid may have a voice, and I know that he plays those instruments that he seemingly taught himself to play, but that IS NOT what gets him all his money and his fame. I guarantee you that if he was as ugly as Oscar The Grouch, all else about him being the same, then he wouldn't even have a fraction of the fame that he has, if any at all. The over-emphasis on image is so obvious, it's not even funny.<br /><br />Honestly, if you MUST listen to this, then that's fine. However, I really have to take issue with those who claim, \""Oh, he's the greatest this, he's the greatest that, he's FIRST RATE!\"" or \""He's here to stay, he's going to go down in history!\"" To those people, I will say this: STOP IT! STOP IT RIGHT NOW!!! Dream all you want, but just because you say it, DOES NOT mean that it's true! You are kidding no one but yourselves, and you WILL regret it later on in life. Listen to some Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins, Marvin Gaye, Elvis Costello, John Coltrane, B.B. King, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Nirvana, Tupac Shakur, Depeche Mode, Devo, Enya, Beethoven, Wagner, or any kind of contemporary independent music (an encyclopedia of bands and artists in itself) out there, and THEN tell me he's the greatest.<br /><br />To Mr. G. Issacs: If you are reading this, let me tell you right now that you are DEAD WRONG to say that Justin Bieber is \""the big musician of this generation.\"" He is far from it. He is nowhere even CLOSE. Anyone who speaks of him in such a way is automatically ignorant, and is kidding themselves to no end. There are a countless number of musicians/bands/artists out there right now across many distinctive genres who are barely known to the general public, and yet despite the astronomical amount of talent, uniqueness and creativity they have over Justin, their music is not \""marketable\"" enough. THOSE people are what collectively make up this generation's big musicians, NOT Justin!

You've done it TWICE before, and lost miserably both times. You're not gaining anything from having a problem with someone like me who is willing to stand up for what I believe in. I am most certainly not biased, nor am I close-minded, even though you like to say that I am.

As for Richard Wagner, I own his complete operas. Boo-ya! Please feel free to read the extended response I left you on another review on this album. I think its content should suffice. :)<br /><br />All in all, if you must listen to this album and enjoy it, I have no objections, but DO NOT proclaim that Justin Bieber is the greatest of anything, because he's not!

The set-up is great, the characters engaging, the acting is perfect, and the stage is set for the protagonist (a professional assassin) to melt-down on the job. We see the moral disintegration of the lead, and I assumed that that would be the heart of the plot. But, guess what... that is NOT the story. The whole thing goes sideways when, near the end, without warning, the viewer and the characters are immersed in a scene straight out of The Wicker Man complete with goofy masks and a sacrifice parade. No details, no explanation, no story flow. The protagonist just goes along with it, and other less central players who have populated the story from the beginning are quickly revealed to be a part of it... THE END. No climax, no full circle, no logic... juuussst THE END.<br /><br />Either the writers/producers/director of this film are horribly unskilled at their job, or this thing was improv from the get go, and they couldn't figure out how to end it.<br /><br />I give two stars for the acting, and for the chills created by what the viewer is led to believe is the disturbing plot. Other than that, the viewer is left with a WTF vibe by the credits suddenly rolling, and there is absolutely NO plot resolution.

I was very nervous buying it after reading the single review posted, which said that it didn't work at all; however I am glad I made the investment and encourage any who need to quickly convert video and audio files to consider this program.  The length of this review is to hopefully give others more information than I had when I took the gamble on buying it.  So feel free to ignore some of the details if you wish - it won't bother me at all :).<br /><br />This product is a very simple but effective program.  I was looking for a way to transfer video from my DVD's to my computer and ipod, and this program really delivered.  In combination with the free online download DVD Decrypter, I was able to remove the copy protection from my DVD's with the decrypter, and then convert the .VOB format into .MPEG4 using this video converter. (For more info on DVD Decrypter, wikipedia has a page dedicated to the program.)<br /><br />This is a great tool to use for converting from one video format to another; for converting from one audio format to another; and I was pleasantly surprised to find that you can even convert from one video format to an audio format.  This third option was great because I have a DVD of Johnny Cash's Chapter and Verse, which I wanted to have on my ipod to listen to in the car, and believe it or not, this program converted the video taken by DVD Decrypter and gave me just the pure audio format! I love it!<br /><br />As for converting formats into HD movies, I haven't explored those options just yet but I am certain it works just as well as the regular formats.  The product description isn't kidding when it says it has a lot of formats to convert between.  Though I don't consider myself an expert with computers and audio/video formats, all of the ones I recognize are in the drop down menu choice such as, WMA, WAV, MP3, AAC, OGG, FLAC; MPEG 1,2, and MPEG4, MOV, FLV, MKV, AVI, etc...<br /><br />The installation is pretty straight forward, requiring administrator privileges to install completely (tried under a limited account first time but it couldn't access the necessary files and so it didn't work).  The download time was only a few minutes on my standard Comcast cable connection.  As for installation time, it only took a couple of minutes as well and didn't require a reboot of my computer, (I hate having to do that).<br /><br />Coming to System Requirements, for those who are interested or would like to compare to their own, I have a Dell Studio 1555 laptop with Microsoft Windows XP service pack 3 installed, with INTEL Core 2 Duo CPU - T9550 @ 2.66 GHz.  Also I have 3 GB of RAM.  I ordered these improvements with my laptop and believe that the program works very fast because of it.  When I monitor my CPU activity from Task Manager during the conversion, it takes about 70-100% of one core processor and about 10-50% of the other, leaving me free to do other tasks on the computer as it works.  However, I am unsure how well the program functions on other computers with slower CPU's and limited RAM.  Also, storage room is another requirement that should be considered with video, since an average file size for DVD's I have put on my computer is around 5 GB.<br /><br />Some other features to mention that are nice about the program is the ability to set it so that it will convert the video/audio files on queue and then either hibernate or shutdown when its complete.  This allows me to place several movies on my computer before I go to bed, and then start the Movavi converter and go to sleep.  Also, when you add a file to the converter queue, (a note on that - the program doesn't recognize .VOB files when you click the add file buttion, so in the drop down box at the bottom where it says \""All Formats\"", you have to choose \""All Files\"" in order for the movie to show up if you are using DVD Decrypter) a nice feature of the program is that you can view the selected file in the video box to the right of the queue screen - which is great for either watching the movie through, or making sure you have the right file selected.  The layout is pretty simple, and the nice thing about this program is that there are no advertisements around, unlike the free online video converters.  There are several other aspects of the program which seem nice, like simple editing tasks, splitting video files, adding watermarks, etc... however since I have not used them, I will not comment on them here.<br /><br />Overall, I really appreciate that the company that made this program separated it from the entire video suite.  I'd hate to have to pay 60 dollars for the entire suite and only use this part of it.  The $30 price I paid for the converter is really worth it.  Not to mention I can download it from Amazon an unlimited amount of times in the future if need be.  Also, in the settings menu, the program allows you to uncheck a couple settings that the program uses to send information to the company from the program (the one I unchecked says \""Send anonymous usage stats to Movavi\"") - which I appreciate since I like my privacy, whether they say its anonymous or not.<br /><br />One more note, the program allows you to set the quality of the video being converted, so it can turn out either just like the DVD, or more pixelated but taking less space on your hard drive.  I have usually opted for a slightly pixelated version since I only plan to watch the movies on my Ipod, (but they are still watchable full screen on my computer.)  I only mention this because some of you may want to use this to convert high quality videos and I have not as of yet tried to do this.  I leave it to a future review to comment on the program's HD abilities.  Hope it works out as well for you as it has for me.<br /><br />Time for me to watch a newly converted dvd movie on my computer :).ck the add file buttion, so in the drop down box at the bottom where it says \""All Formats\"", you have to choose \""All Files\"" in order for the movie to show up if you are using DVD Decrypter) a nice feature of the program is that you can view the selected file in the video box to the right of the queue screen - which is great for either watching the movie through, or making sure you have the right file selected.

I picked up X4 when it was on sale and it improved stability but didn't fix some annoyances I had like the VideoStudio window not being re-sizable and stuck at full-screen, or not being able to edit MP4s (specifically from my HDPVR - editing other MP4s from my camera or youtube works as intended).  I was pretty excited to see that X5 included the ability to re-size the program window and that feature has really made my life simpler when I'm working in the program, but the MP4 problem has yet to be sufficiently addressed.  The new desktop capture feature, which also seemed promising is instead a disappointment, as  it's restricted to outputting only WMV files as far as I can tell.<br /><br />As a preexisting VideoStudio Pro user, I'm really hesitant to give X5 more than 3 stars, but the new window re-size ability makes preparing to edit not the chore that it once was. I had to ready various folder windows on my second monitor before even thinking about loading up X3/X4, and it's a non-issue in X5.

Definitely!<br /><br />But whether it's raw or pristine/perfect, if it tells a story you need to hear then, and only then, has the real purpose been accomplished and the soul rejoices.  We are all accustomed to the pretty-perfect-flawless recordings that have nothing to say.  You may tap your foot to its rhythms but there is nothing for the head, heart or soul.

Yes, great attention is paid to the backdrop of the lyrics being expressed in its various textures of lyrical form with great guitars (both acoustic and electric, drums, organ, and a chorus that delivers.

So with the grove of country/rock and the feel only a \""Brit\"" can bring to it we all surrender to its diagnosis and conclusion and LOOK, my foot is tapping away as well with its driven rhythm.  \""Glory\"" is nothing more than the after-effect of receiving a \""spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him\"" and opening up your month so what is in your heart just pours out in an awe stricken and reverential sort of way.  \""Stop\"" is just that, STOP and pay attention because the real seeker is GOD our heavily Father.  \""Your\"" speaks about he/she who comes to grips with the fact that from Him is from where all true blessings flow and a big shout of praise is the natural outcome.  \""Hope\"" reminds us that what has been promised will come even if as we face our darkest days... therefore, the heart cries out that His will and kingdom would come even if circumstances would deny us that possibility that our Father in heaven insists will come and therefore we wait with much ESPERANZA.  Don't fear, we have an anchor because we have Hope.  \""Family\"" is the anthem of this project.  It speaks for itself and you can't hear it without walking away humming its melody with a smile on your face.  \""Follow\"" is a prayer in melody with much conviction that our thirst and hunger in the innermost person will ultimately be satisfied... and I will NOT die!  \""Sunday\"" simply put is:  Oh boy, Church time!!!  \""GRaCE\"" is a recognition of the unmerited favor our heavenly Father extents to us through his Son Jesus... GRaCE that expresses itself upon those who receive it through faith and not through \""what we do\"".  Finally, \""Sunday People\"" is the GOOD-BYE song that introduces the band and makes you want to hug these folks from the mountains of Tennessee.<br /><br />Great effort guys... and kudos to Cody Smith at SUNDAY DRIVE RECORDINGS in downtown Cookeville!<br /><br />Now I ask... when was the last time you listen to a CD project and walked away with all of the above?

I have been burned many times by their non-sensical changes. Well v2012 tops the list. The changes made to the budgeting feature make the program useless as a budgeting tool.<br /><br />I have just upgraded to v2012 as part of upgrading my computer. I sat down this morning to do some work on my 2012 Budget which had been created under v2010 before I upgraded. Given that it is already February 2012, I was appalled that I was unable to edit budget categories for Jan 2012. I read the garbage in the help files about past months being frozen snapshots of activity, which is a bunch of marketing bull. Also, the return to the 12 month spreadsheet format (which I prefer to the more recent versions' approaches) would slide to the next 12 month period (Feb 2012 to Feb 2013) and could not be fixed on any particular 12 month budget period. This coupled with the comments made by other users make the Budget feature of Quicken 2012 completely useless as a management or control tool. A user is completely unable to adjust a budget for more accurate information if the budget month has passed. As a 40 year public accountant, any client with such a budgeting system would receive a stiff management comment form me. If this gaff were not so awful in its effects as to render this program much less useful, this would be laughable. Quicken must immediately restore the same functionality to the Budget function or risk the support of long-time users (since 1996). Until they do, I will need to do my budgeting in Excel and export actual Quicken data into the Excel worksheets for reporting.<br /><br />I would appreciate a response from the Quicken representative who monitors these comments. Specifically I would like to know when the budget functionality will be restored to the 2010 version (I never used 2011 and based on the forum, that may be good enough). Changing the format of the budget interface is not the issue, its changing the functionality which significantly changes the utility of the program.<br /><br />As an example of what I am driving at: when Quicken changed its budget format from the spreadsheet to the format we've grown used to in v2010, I rolled my eyes and grumbled. I got familiar with the new interface and I used it. I did not get upset about the change BECAUSE ALL THE FUNCTIONALITY REMAINED THE SAME. That is not the case with this change. I cannot use the program the same way anymore and neither can many of the people posting above me. If Quicken respects its users, it will change back and become useful once again.<br /><br />I can't revert to an older version, as I am now running Quicken Premier on a MacBookPro (using Parallels Desktop 7).

More importantly, to my knowledge, none of their musicians ever met PP&M.<br /><br />That's the big problem and other inaccuracy in the title - the word \""with.\""  PP&M were not WITH this orchestra, not in either space or time.<br /><br />The orchestra is dubbed in.  Now, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with this.  Musicians and producers do it all the time.  But normally the musicians know that the orchestra will be added in later.  They arrange their music (or the arranger does) to allow for the accompaniment.  They perform it accordingly.<br /><br />Not here.  Producer Kevin Salem grabbed some old PP&M live concert recordings - PP&M playing with no orchestra in sight, with no intention of being accompanied by one - and slathered on the orchestra.  Arranger and conductor Robert DeCormier gives it his all, but our three friends remain utterly, inevitably, oblivious of him.  The result is about what you'd expect from musicians who aren't really playing together.  You can't meet an immovable object halfway.<br /><br />Which brings us to the other major issue here: DeCormier's arrangements.  Maybe I'm spoiled by the sensitive musicianship Peter Schickele and Joshua Rifkin lent to Joan Baez's and Judy Collins's best work decades ago.  But while DeCormier is unquestionably a fine choral conductor, this strikes me as musical corn syrup.  At times his ideas are eye-rolling, face-palming trite.<br /><br />It was a sweet and loving act to make this album in memory of Mary Travers.  I just wish they'd made it right, actually recording one of the couple dozen concerts in which PP&M played live with an orchestra.  If Salem had to paste it together this way, at least he should have started with malleable studio album tracks, rather than struggling to fit an orchestra to concert recordings.<br /><br />After PP&M recorded \""Reunion\"" in 1978, they turned it over to producer David Rubinson and largely left him to his own devices.  Peter Yarrow was mortified with the result; he's called it \""our worst album.\""  For years after the Reunion LP went out of print, Peter vetoed reissuing it.  \""Reunion\"" is, admittedly, pretty far from PP&M's trademark sound.  But it's arguably a greater musical and artistic success than \""Peter Paul and Mary with Symphony Orchestra.\""  So I'm surprised that Peter gave this one a pass.  Maybe he really WAS doing it for Mary.  I wonder what she'd think.<br /><br />I've listened to this album several times since I bought it in 2010.  Every time, before it's half done, I find myself wishing I could just turn off the orchestra, the better to hear PP&M's own original voices.  Fortunately, PP&M left me - us - a gratifyingly large body of their own authentic, vital work - all without symphony orchestra.",2012-06-14,623,extra_long,2012-06,music

This is not a good noir story.<br /><br />Back in the late 70's it seemed like every new piece of music that came out got slapped with one of two labels. Either it was \""disco\"" or it was \""new wave/punk.\"" It was largely because of the marketing needs of the time. Most people liked one form or the other. Few liked both. It's ridiculous thinking about it now, but there were actual riots between the two factions of music fans. One source of great irritation for music fans was that the record labels tried their hardest to steer marketing in a manner that tricked people into buying music that didn't really fit their prefered genre. Because of this, groups like the Ramones, the Cramps, and the Clash, got slapped with the same \""new wave/punk\"" label as acts like Blondie, the Talking Heads, and the Stray Cats. Even Huey Lewis and Billy Joel got tagged as part of the \""new wave\"" scene despite the fact that Huey Lewis looked more like a math teacher than a punk rocker. My point? The same thing is happening with certain book genres of late.<br /><br />Labelling \""Free Fall\"" as a crime noir story won't make it one any more than naming a kitten, \""Fido\"" will turn it into a dog. The short story itself is an extremely predictable and linear piece. Paul D. Marks is an author of some acclaim, and in fairness to him I'll try another book or two of his and see if I can find something more in his wheelhouse before giving up. I think in this case he tried too hard to squeeze an idea into the noir framework and the peg was just too round to fit in the square hole. In the story the bar where the primary characters meet is named, \""The Cafe Noir.\"" Marks also drops the names of actors from old gangster films like so many rocks in a tumbler of scotch. The couple in the story watch several DVDs together and of course, they're all well known black & white noir classics such as, \""Double Indemnity.\"" It's not like he wasn't familiar with his subject matter. It's more as if he just didn't bother with making the necessary effort to pull it off.<br /><br />Here's a good example of what I'm talking about. Amidst all the hard-boiled tough guys and chain-smoking femme fatales that are the hallmarks of good film noir is the glue that holds them all together. These tales, whether written by folks like Dashiell Hammett, or filmed with stars like Bogey and Lorre, the dialogue is peppered with colorful similes and metaphors. Here is a sampling from just one of the descriptive paragraphs from \""Free Fall\"":<br /><br />\""...ending in 3 inch come-you-know-what-me sandals...\""<br />\""I would have bought her anything she wanted to drink. Hell, I would bought her a Porsche if she'd asked...\""<br /><br />I've read that first comment several times trying to understand it. I've also read it to several other fans of the genre. None of us has as of yet figured out exactly what the heck he's saying about those sandals. Judicial deletion of a couple of hyphens might help, but since when would a tough guy substitute the phrase, \""you-know-what?\""  As to the second, when I as the reader can come up with something better than the author does, the story needs a rewrite. Here's my take on the same line...<br /><br />\""I took one look at her and knew I was in deep. I offered to buy her a drink. Had she said no, I'd have offered to buy her the whole bar. Yeah, I was headed for trouble.\""<br /><br />I'm not saying it's perfect, but at least it makes sense. The bottom line is that there is an awful lot of great noir to be had out there. A reader doesn't have to settle for a half-baked effort where anyone familiar with the genre will see the end coming from just a few short pages into the story.

It's not a contrived strange just for the sake of it to appear artsy -- Nacho Libre exudes a strangeness that, in my opinion, is built upon thought, talent and experience.  I found myself scratching my head, so to speak, numerous times, wondering why on earth someone would write, direct and act in a movie this bizarre and *how* they got their ideas.

The narrative jumps between 2-3 main characters in each of the camps - German, French, and Scottish - and humanizes them against the backdrop of a war that was already brutal and about to become far more so, though none of the protagonists knew it at the time.  Because of the size of the cast and the need to show some aspect of each of their lives, the characterization is direct, short, and revealing (some might call it a bit thin, though that is a minor quibble).  The focus of the movie is the interaction of the officers on each side as they work through their own prejudices, weaknesses, and fears.  Though moral questions do at times arise, there is little doubt that the characters will do the right thing - this is, after all, a Christmas movie, not Saving Private Ryan or an adaptation of All Quiet or Catch 22.  The movie treats the war accurately and boldly, showing the costs in ways large and small, and the scenes of the armistice and the denouement as it ends touchingly depict a European civilization where the bonds of common humanity still ran deep enough to overcome the passions of nationalism and patriotism, at least for a little while.<br /><br />The movie shifts between German, French, and English, with sub-titles for those sections not in English; it also includes renditions of a few classic Christmas songs, sung by a German tenor and soprano who are in the trenches during the armistice.",2012-12-19,274,long,2012-12,videos

Bassists Jim Diaz and Sean McMillan provide musicality, power, and elegance to complement each song.  From moment to moment one can hear influences ranging from ELP, Tull, Steely Dan, and Kansas, all combined in a new, fresh way. Speaking of Kansas, violinist David Ragsdale guests as Nero and fiddles away in 13/8 on the fade-out of 'Rome.'<br /><br />Lyrically, the songs see Tim telling a story ('Voyager'), providing social criticism ('Rome'), and plumbing sensitive emotional dimensions brought about through crisis ('Numb) and tragedy ('Afterword').  The last two, in particular, deal with disillusionment and loss in an open, vulnerable manner in stark contrast to the CD's more aggressive tunes.  The poignant reflections offered here are simultaneously raw and touching, yet compassionately sympathetic.<br /><br />All in all, there is much to enjoy in this collection of songs. Repeated listenings reveal the depth of the compositions and lyrics, the thematic development throughout, and above all, the hard work behind this art.  Faithscience is a burst of creativity and musical expression.",2012-11-11,291,long,2012-11,music

One day, she is flabbergasted to find Elizabeth Bennet[Gemma Arterton] herself facing her in her bathroom. Apparently, there is a 'magical' door through her bath wall that is able to transport Lizzie from Meryton to contemporary London. Before long, Amanda gleefully wanders through the portal into Lizzie's house with all its chaos, and life as Amanda knows it will never again be the same.<br /><br />Amanda tries her best to get the other characters from P&P to follow through on the novel's plot, a situation made difficult by Lizzie's absence [glibly explained away as visiting Hammersmith, Amanda's home]. Mr Bingley in the meantime finds Amanda more interesting than Jane, and things get more complicated when Amanda meets Mr Darcy[a suitably brooding and haughty, yet drool-worthy Elliott Cowan]. Though Amanda finds Darcy interesting and attractive, his rudeness towards her is irksome, and the pair are soon engaged in witty verbal sparring.<br /><br />The dialogue is part of what makes this production so entertaining. At one point, Jane is ill and ensconced in Bingley's country estate, and Darcy asks that Amanda leave. Bingley protests, saying 'She has paracetamols!' [paracetamol being the British equivalent of our Tylenol, or other fever-reducing medications]. There are lots of anachronisms in this series,which is to be expected given the two distinct time periods.<br /><br />The cast is excellent - Alex Kingston [of ER] plays a very different Mrs Bennett, portraying a woman who has steely determination and can be downright nasty when she feels her interests threatened. Hugh Bonneville makes a livelier Mr Bennett than we are used to in the other adaptations. Guy Henry plays the greasy Mr Collins to a \""T\"", and his performance actually made me shudder in revulsion. George Wickham's role here is quite surprising, with a twist in his story that was unexpected.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fresh, revisionist approach to P&P, and though it does not follow the traditional plot of P&P, it is fun and entertaining, and with a mostly likable cast that carry this production through. Final verdict - fun and fresh, not to be taken too seriously.ermination and can be downright nasty when she feels her interests threatened.

The plot could have been written for a young adult church group, which is not just to say that it has some sort of Christian message (that would not be an issue), but that it could only appeal to someone whose view of spirituality spins on the axis of American non-denominationalism.  The result is a horror movie that fails in every respect with the added embarrassment of being preachy and generally idiotic.<br /><br />Here, I'll spoil the story for you.  A team of television ghost hunters are called by a man of extreme wealth who was released from prison (charges unmentioned) as he is due for his imminent death from pancreatic cancer.  He also happens to be the owner of a closed asylum for the insane which is purported to be haunted by some vicious, murderous spirits. The deal is that they get one weekend with the asylum for their 50th episode (hence the name - see what they did?). Why?  The man has lived a pretty horrendous life, as he says \""I have broken every one of God's ten commandments\"".  He wants to know if the asylum is haunted because if it is, that somehow means he will spend eternity burning in Hell.  Enter our psuedo-anti-hero, a man of broken faith who runs the aforementioned group of television ghost hunters with his childhood friend, an annoying man of ambiguous Latin descent and the token pretty girl.  The team is well established as using the powers of reason and observation to debunk spiritual encounters, so it seems the rich man is really hoping to clear his mind when they come back with a rational explanation for the hauntings.  The catch to all of this  is that they have to work with a team of rival, faith-based investigators... for some reason.  Personal conflict ensues while the characters all prepare for a night of \""investigating\"".  Throughout an unspecified amount of time, horrible special effects are caught on high-definition cameras with cheesyfilters applied.  The nonsensical plot devices continue until the full story is revealed in one anti-climactic scene (last chance, here be real spoilers).  An inmate who had been brought in for the astonishing crime of raping and killing 7 women had killed his 8th victim while in the asylum - the nurse who is briefly alluded to in the beginning and then poorly animated later on when she pops into view for cheap scares.  The kicker?  He was murdering as a part of some undefined Satanic ritual (I kid you not) and by invoking him during the investigation, they allowed him to take his 9th victim in the young psychic from the rival investigation team.  Now a portal to Hell can open and... I dunno.  I'm sure if I went to my local mega-church more, I would be indoctrinated with all sorts of silly ideas about what will happen when those pesky Satanists open portals to Hell.  In this movie, however, all that happens is that the now demon-ghost-ex-murderer stands in front of a burning, inverted pentagram with horns sticking out of his forehead until our anti-hero regains his faith and dispels the demon with a cross and incantation.  All the while - even while the young psychic gets her neck snapped and one of the other investigators gets gored, the idiotic camera men follow the investigators around like loyal puppies, never once flinching at the horrors around them.  In the end, of course, our anti-hero dies, along with the lead investigator from the rival team, and enough footage makes its way to the wealthy ex-con, who sobs quietly while we take in the movie's message: repent, or burn in Hell.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the crazy, Satanic inmate? He died of AIDS.  Hey, if it's important enough for the movie to point out, it's important enough for my review.  Why they made a point of it I will leave to your speculation.<br /><br />Sadly, with a production budget several magnitudes higher than some other, decent independent horror movies, the writer/directors seemed to care moreabout their preaching than creating something worth watching.  It seems like the actors didn't even try in most parts, though I can't honestly expect them to fulfill the superhuman task of delivering such poorly written dialog with any degree of emotion or realism.  There was no atmosphere to the movie and all of the ghosty things popped out of the screen like Halloween decorations.  It was as though the director has never even had a nightmare, but tried to appeal to what they think \""the kids\"" will think is scary.  The camera work is, I think, supposed to be from the 2nd person point of view that is outrageously popular in Paranormal Activity, Grave Encounters and others.  However, it switches awkwardly at times without explanation and what we end up with is confusing and disingenuous.  It did not work in the Doom movie, it does not work here.  Stay in one perspective, directors, or at least justify the change very, very well!<br /><br />All in all, I am actually upset that I watched this movie.  I'm glad that I only rented it, but I have to forever live with the fact that I gave these people a portion of money that I earned honestly.  The best that I can hope for at this point is to post this review around and hope that I can save others from the same fate.<br /><br />My favorite line, \""A portal has to open on a Satanic symbol, like an inverted pentagram or something, right?\"".

But that's simultaneously encouraging and depressing: on the one hand, this is the best thing they've put out in nearly two decades; on the other hand, it's still not very good at all.<br /><br />I've been the hardest-core SP fan since Mellon Collie came out.  Their best work is unforgettable, and Corgan at his height was one of the best songwriters of all time.  But Oceania is representative of his more recent efforts: it's overproduced in a bad way, it's lacking in energy and drive, and--perhaps worst of all--it's completely forgettable.  Corgan's written some of the best riffs in rock music--Cherub Rock, Rocket, Today, Bullet With Butterfly Wings, Zero, 1979--but there's literally not one riff on this album that sticks with me or that motivates me to listen to it again, only louder.  The whole time I was listening to the album, I just kept thinking, \""Ok, let's wrap this song up so that we can move onto something different and hopefully better.\""<br /><br />Corgan's always been great at writing long songs.  His longest songs are among his best--Soma, Thru the Eyes of Ruby, Porcelina, The Aeroplane Flies High.  But the longest song on the album--the title track--is awful.  It's like several songs spliced together, and it never develops or moves or does anything.  The best word to describe it is \""inert.\""<br /><br />Perhaps the thing I liked most about the Pumpkins sound was the extreme dynamic range.  Remember that part of BWBW where all the loud guitars go away and it's just Billy and some very jangly, clean electrics?  Then he screams at the top of his lungs while the guitars roar?  That's not even the best example in their catalog, but there's nothing even remotely like that here.  There's some quite-then-loud parts, but they all seem forced and inorganic.<br /><br />Then there's all the electronic nonsense.  On Tonight, Tonight, Corgan used real strings to amazing effect.  Here, he's got a cheap synthesizer apparently set to the default factory tone.  It's embarrassing, frankly.  And that's before you even get to the two consecutive songs that sound like they're going to be Baba O'Reilly knock-offs before turning into boring nonsense.<br /><br />This isn't the worst album the Pumpkins have put out--I think that distinction goes to Zeitgeist--but it's not very good, either.  I was so excited when I read that this was a return to form.  But it's not.  It's more of the same mediocre crap they've been putting out for almost twenty years at this point.<br /><br />And now I feel so, so old.<br /><br />Edited to add two things I forgot in the original review:<br /><br />The vocals are almost non-existent.  Corgan's got one of the most distinctive voices in rock music, but it's almost as if he's afraid to use it here.  His vocals are always flat--as a commenter pointed out, there's neither his trademark scream or his falsetto.  It's just the blandest vocals delivering extremely forgettable melodies with this annoying false earnestness.<br /><br />And finally, there are exactly zero memorable guitar solos.  The Pumpkins have always been guitar-oriented rock, but the guitar work here is really sort of lazy.",2012-06-20,547,extra_long,2012-06,music

Took some tweaking and configuring to get the game to work at all - and this is coming from a veteran PC gamer used to modding to my heart's content.    I see others had problems even launching the game.  Others had issues getting it to activate.  Perhaps the following may be helpful to some (I hope).  Launch issues:  After the game downloads, you may notice the absence of a desktop shortcut to launch the game.  If you go into the default installation folder and click on the launch icon, it may do nothing.  Here's why:  The game isn't completely installed yet.  Click on the \""Setup\"" application link in the folder and it will finish installing the game (and you should see a new screen that indicates downloading of patches).  You're nearly good to go...nearly...  Server issues:  EA's servers don't seem to want to receive the product key when entered upon launching the game itself, meaning that you can't play your game at all (online or off).  Not cool, right?  There is a simple workaround, although not everyone may like this.  EA's digital download service, Origin, can be your solution.  It's free, but not something that every gamer welcomes (but that's beyond the scope of this review).  After you install Origin, in the upper right corner (next to the question mark icon) you'll see a gear icon - hover over the gear and drop down to \""Redeem Product Code\"".  Copy and paste your product code from Amazon.  You'll see Darkspore populate in the Origin \""Games\"" window.  Click the \""play\"" icon, copy and paste your product code when asked, and * poof * problem solved.  I didn't have to fresh install using this method, although you could likely do that as well.

I've been a simple Quicken user for more than 10 years, upgrading along the way as Quicken updates yearly.  Updates are clearly just a way to \""milk\"" users for more money but we're used to this, like Norton antivirus subscriptions.  But, when I update Norton, my computer still works okay.  I usually kept updating Quicken even though I didn't really need it.  If you get too far behind, the risks and learning curves just get higher.  I only use Quicken as a checkbook and for Bill Pay.  It has been flawless in paying bills so I'm happy about that.  What Quicken does is to release a new and buggy version every year, just before the end of the year.  After about 9 months, the bugs are worked and on the 10th month, they release a new version and here we go again.  I've learned over the years not to upgrade at the earliest opportunity because of bugs and because the upgrade gets cheaper later.  I saw the 2012 upgrade offered in 2011 but I waited. Then, in February 2012, I downloaded TurboTax from Amazon.  This went smoothly.  Amazon then sent me a killer low price Quicken 2012 offer.  Due to stupidity and greed on my part, I took the bait.  I have downloaded a number of s/w programs from Amazon and they have gone smoothly and installed without problems, including Quicken 2012 (not all prior Quicken versions installed without errors).  But, when I ran Q12, I found that I could no longer update my Wells Fargo checking account transactions.  Even though I am a simple (and now studid) user, I need the downloads to help me determine when I will run out of money in my checking account.  I try to not keep any more money there than I have to because very little interest is paid.  I had read about problems with downloads earlier but thought maybe they had been fixed or would not affect me.  So, here I am, what do I do?  I couldn't just \""restore\"" my Q2011 version because the download and install didn't save the configuration before the new install (the TurboTax download and install DID save the current configuration).  So, I can't go back to my tried and true Q11 without some risk of losing my data.  I did research on the internet and via help but no solutions.  This is like buying a new car, driving it home, and then having to change the timing belt (by yourself) before you can drive it again.  Wells Fargo, and other banks, offer Bill Pay and it's free or at a nominal charge (6.95 for me versus 9.95 for Quicken).  So, I'm just a little ways away from dumping Quicken for good.  I can understand that new s/w features may have problems but I can't understand how simple things, like downloading transactions, can get broken.  Fortunately, Bill Pay seems to still be working.  It you're smarter than me, at least save your current configuration before installing Q12.  Re-edited 2/13/12 to add the following:  Received a comment on this post from a Quicken support person that I could always \""go back to Q11\"".  So, I uninstalled Q12 and re-installed Q11. But YOU CAN'T GO BACKWARDS this way because Q12 REFORMATS your data file.  When I tried to restore the data file in the re-installed Q11, an error message says \""QUICKEN can't read this file\""!!!  So, I had to uninstall Q11 and re-install Q12 so I could at least read my data and pay bills.  If Quicken had simply created a Windows Backup file before installing Q12, I would hope that a reversion via Windows Restore would work.  I just don't like taking chances with my data and auto pays and financial records by doing multiple installs and uninstalls.  My solution is to \""eat\"" my copy of Q12 and switch to Wells Fargo Bill Pay.  It's free for me ($6.95/mo for some)and I don't have to pay for yearly Quicken bombs and $9.95/mo for Bill Pay.

There are various missions you can complete as well as buying characters with Sega Miles, but this only goes so far.<br /><br />The ideal way to play is with friends, but you need several controllers to do so because there is no online play. Why this was stripped from the PC version beats me, but it really brings down the experience since crowding around one computer isn't very convenient. Once you do get some friends aboard the game is a blast and power sliding and knocking enemies down makes for great laughs.<br /><br />But when it's all said and done the game is a really average kart racer and has dated graphics as well as some annoying sounds. The game just feels the same no matter what you do in single player and I highly doubt anyone over 10 can play all 50+ missions without going crazy. If there was just some online play in here it could sweeten the deal some, but the single player can only be tolerated for so long.ly doubt anyone over 10 can play all 50+ missions without going crazy.

Then I read the reviews and the interpretation of the movie on Wikipedia, which I advise for anyone wondering what they just watched if they don't want to read a book.<br /><br />I like the ideas behind the movie, but I have to admit I got lost trying to figure out elements in the details, which made me miss the big picture. If there were a few shots added to the film that explained a little more, then it wouldn't have left me perplexed on minor things.<br /><br />First, I kept thinking I was seeing the same monolith not four different ones. I still don't know why the moon monolith was buried. It wasn't buried on Earth. Wouldn't it have been just as fascinating to simply find it standing on the moon's surface? Then the moon monolith making a horrible noise seemed like it didn't want anyone touching it rather than it being a signal that man made it to the moon.<br /><br />The next problem was the change in characters from Frank to Dave. I kept wondering when Frank was going to reappear, since the film focused on him after the ape intro, and he's contemporary to Dave.<br /><br />Then Dave makes it to Jupiter. Something happens to him without his touching the outer space floating monolith. Then did he take the monolith back to a hotel room on a space station similar to what Frank was on? Was he rapidly aging or was he there for decades? Was it all happening in his head while the lights were flashing in his eyes? Wikipedia stated that Clarke's book explained that the alien monolith picked up transmissions of how man lived at that point in time and had created an alien zoo to house Dave in - this part of the story was completely skipped in the movie.<br /><br />Then Dave dies, and a giant space baby appears. Where did the hotel/zoo go? Again, it's minor questions like these that left me confused.<br /><br />The movie doesn't transition between parts very well. The best transition was from bone to spaceship, showing man's evolution from animalto space explorers, but I even missed that the first time watching it.<br /><br />Viewers complain about the slow pace of the movie, but the slow parts basically show how space travel might be for the common man - something we still have yet to achieve. The quietness of space is also there. In fact, most of our senses become useless in space. You can't touch it, smell it, taste it, or hear it. Even visually, you see mostly darkness. The low occupancy of the ships reflects this vastness of space and just how insignificant we are in the universe.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very thought provoking film. It just needs a few more dots connected. Maybe if they had edited out the parts that we understand without watching the same thing for 10 minutes like the flashing lights sequence and put in things that really do need an explanation as I mentioned above, it would've been perfect.",2012-06-03,517,extra_long,2012-06,videos

I really enjoy the stories and the universe that was created in them. Truth be told I wanted to love this movie, but I just cant. I have been waiting for this film for a long time, just like all the others that love the JDatE series, and I had no inner hype; I was certain that this would not match up with my own mental images of reading the books. This did not hinder me as I put aside the expectation of a perfect adaptation as most fans of books watching a film version have or should. It is better to be presently surprised than disappointed. Unfortunately even with my preparations and allowance for the film, it disappointed me.    The film started fine, down to the meat monster, but then some things were left out. The meat puns for one coming from John were one of my favorite aspects of his character. It seemed odd to omit them as they were just dialog, the scene was a bit of a non sequitur in the books so I didn't expect a focus on it but it was one of my favorite sections, (and they got the door scene right : D  )After that it seems that they just made a mad dash to squish the entire book into the film. Honestly I would have been OK if they only went to the Las Vegas portion and left the rest to a second movie. The book itself almost has a pause and restart after that section. However it seems that they decided to haphazardly mesh the entire story together, with little setup for the events that occurred. Another one of my favorite moments from the book was handled in a less than stellar manner, the mustache attack, and the bratwurst. The mustache looked horrible, I wasn't expecting the CG capabilities of Pixar, but it could have been done in a better fashion. And no mustard on the brat? A small detail but still noticeable. Nothing in the film had the impact that it should have for the sole reason that it had no setup before hand. Peter North, the gateway, Korrok, the monsters (wig monsters) all seemed to be there just because with no other back story. Also the exclusion of Jennifer Lopez for Amy was odd as well and spoke to a desire to lump all the story into a short time span, while stripping Amy of the qualities that made her an awesome character, not just a love interest. Leaving out monster Dave, and the build up to Korrok really robbed the ending. The ending was especially disappointing for me, I was looking forward to S***Narnia and I was let down. I understand that there were time and monetary constraints and these are all purely my opinions, but anything worth doing is worth doing right. Also why change the dogs name? I could see no real reason for that, I mean Bark Lee is a clever name but its not Molly. The whole film felt like the Las Vegas arc with the Korrok ending jammed in to fit for time.    On this movie as a so bad its good film, it doesn't really get there either. I am a big fan of B and below movies as well. Ed Wood was a visionary, but I didn't get any of the feel from this movie that would make me laugh at how bad it was. It all fell kind of flat to me, given the source material it makes it had to keep this as a campy classic. It cant take itself seriously enough for me to laugh at the effort. Troma was great at making films that know they are bad and are better for it, this seems to aspire for a great movie that is also a campy cult classic, and get stuck being a bit bland. I will say that I did like Paul Giamatti as the reporter however, I think he did that part well.    I love these books, and this movie does not change that. To be honest I may just either forget it or think of it as a separate story. I love that there was a movie made and I paid upfront to support that, however I wanted to lay out my honest opinion of the film. I have read other comments that feel a similar disappointment, and I wish that I could like this as much as others seem too but I cant. I really tried to like it, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and more because of the books, but the end result was just not that good. I hope there is another or even better a miniseries or web series, I believe that these stories can make amazing films, they just didn't achieve that with this one. I am sorry to David and John but I will still buy every book you release and watch every film you put out, but if you don't receive feedback how can we make any progress. Please know this is not a personal attack and I am a fan of the books, I look forward to new adventures with David and John.",2012-12-31,887,extra_long,2012-12,videos

The reviews of last year's Quicken 2012 were equally frightening. I have been using Quicken deluxe for many years and went through all the frustrating additions and deletions of features and an occasional upgrade problem. I was using 2010 and knew my time was running out before I had to upgrade to the newest version to be able to continue syncing my accounts. I think its 3 years max, but I usually upgrade every 2 years.<br /><br />I took the risk tonight and the upgrade was fast and painless.  I have 14 years of account transaction detail and about 20 accounts. In less than 10 minutes I was back up and running and everything worked as it did before. Completely painless! For those that had problems with the mobile apps, I have no use for them.  I would NEVER put my financial information on a phone or tablet that is easily lost or stolen. That just makes no sense to me.<br /><br />As for the 4 stars instead of 5, that's just because I had to spend $50.00 for an upgrade I didn't want or need.  Other than a slightly new look and a few new features and icons, it the same stuff every year.  I realize that Intuit needs to keep revenue up, so I pay my $50.00 every year or so in hopes that they continue to make this software since there are no other options out there.<br /><br />Update 12/20/2012<br /><br />I just opened Quicken today and there was a version 9 update.  To say I was nervous doing the update would be an understatement. But the update completed without any issues. I am an IT professional by trade. Having 9 major updates or revisions to any software product in just a few months is very troubling.  In this latest update there were 24 bug fixes.  If you look at the release notes of the last 8 updates, there are dozens of other bug fixes. This is really incomprehensible!<br /><br />I don't use most of the features that were fixed. I found some of the reporting and planning features unusable and error prone.  I only use quicken to reconcile all my accounts and to keep track of my savings and net worth.  That is really what quicken was originally designed to do and it still does it well.  I think Intuit went off the cliff trying to make Quicken something it was never intended to be just to justify the yearly upgrade price. In the process, they created an overly complicated and buggy piece of software that will never satisfy all their different user's requirements.<br /><br />Software programmers are not accountants, and accountants are not software programmers and that is where this program fails.  I have seen this many times. Unless another software company with the desire and money to take on this challenge comes along, I don't see this program surviving more than another year or two. That will be a sad day for all of us that have years invested in this product. But all good things come to an end I guess.<br /><br />12/30/2012<br />I received an invitation to write a product review on the Quicken website that I had to share.  The following is the \""Writing Guidelines\"" They require you adhere to post the review.  The only thing missing is, \""we only publish positive reviews\"".  I could not find any reviews on their site except small (positive) snippets on the product page.<br /><br />(Quicken Review Writing Guidelines)<br />We want to publish your review, so please:<br />*keep your review focused on the product<br />*avoid writing about customer service; contact us instead if you have issues requiring immediate attention<br />*refrain from mentioning competitors or the specific price you paid for the product<br /><br />1/10/2013  Update<br /><br />I just ran the 10th update to this program.

I am sure there are a lot of Josh's listeners who like all of his music just how it is. I grew up listening to heavy music, but now find I really prefer folk songs and spiritual compositions that are mostly acoustic. Since many of Josh's songs have a surf/rap/beat style, what attracts me to him? First, I got hooked by some acoustic spirituals he did. Second, his lyrical offerings and vocals are so captivating. Some of his songs show some mighty fine material for Christian contemplation and conduct, and I like the way he communicates it all. As on Josh's prior albums, the pieces on this album I could definitely do without are the rap/beat pieces. Actually, when Josh performs live, especially when he is alone or with a couple of other acoustics, all of his music is great. When he is required to take some of these electro- and beat-based songs and must perform them live, in a living-room or coffee-house style, this is where Josh's real talent and ability come forth. I have really wondered if Josh knows how many people would be ministered to if he kept his talents and focus and style, but expressed it all through a real retrograde expression. Not sure whether that is neo, hill-billy, bluegrass, traditional, Appalachian, or something else, but my listening ear believes that Josh's upbeat songs have a bit of CCM feel to them. I don't think that style really expresses his message or persona well. For that reason, I like this album less than any prior album. It had less of what I really liked about Josh Garrels and his music. I know it may suit others just great, I know he has won album of the year with this album, but for me as a listener, it wasn't a move in the right direction. Josh, if you ever put together a live or acoustic work, I will snap it right up. I hope you get radical and return to some of the roots of the music you are playing.<br /><br />When trying to decide a rating for this album, Ihovered between 3 and 4 stars, and figured that at least half a star was there because of my appreciation for his prior work. Three and a half is what I really want to give it. Just to be clear about this work compared to his prior work, although all of his albums have some rap/beat on them, I felt I was more easily able to pick and choose or avoid. It is not in every song on this album either, but it felt like it was encroaching on the beauty even more than before. I know it is probably out of the question for Josh, but I would love to hear him bring a few of the Brother Sun, Sister Moon songs into his acoustical style, or even redo the whole soundtrack. My favorite song here is \""Farther Along\"" and a few others make the grade, but I recommend anything prior to this album.

Catherine and Grace were necessary in Kim's recovery and I can fully understand that!<br /><br />In all honesty, this book is the most helpful memoir about sexual abuse I have read. I even gave my friend who has been through a simliar experience as mine my kindle to read it herself. Most memoirs focus on the negative experience itself instead of providing readers a step-by-step healing process through working with the past and creating a better future. Kim's memoir is the only memoir I can think of about sexual abuse who's ending left me happy and hopeful of my own recovery. I literally ran to an empty room to have a happy dance. That is how helpful and inspiring her ending left me feeling.<br /><br />So please, instead of posting negative reviews about her typos or her choice of using her friends as a comforting recovery process, can we all focus on the fact that this woman, who is NOT an experienced author, took time out of her life to write a memoir in the hopes that it might help other victims such as myself?!? This woman is my hero! I have been trying to write my own memoir for years and could not imagine someone actually inspiring me to get the ball rolling as much as Kim has. For that, I truly thank her. Typos and confusion aside, Kim had been dealt an awful life and turned it around in the most couragous way and then wrote about it. I would recommend this book to anyone struggling after sexual abuse. If it helped me, it might help you as well.<br /><br />Much love and compassion, Amanda",2012-05-15,536,extra_long,2012-05,ebooks

I would consider this a \""starter\"" book; being that, if I had read this first I would have rated it better.  Honestly though this book is an incredibly basic zombie story line.<br /><br />It follows 2 main story lines of a separated couple trying to get to safety and reunite.  There is a 3rd sub-story which consumes a few chapters but doesn't lend much to the story.  There are very few major twists and turns and the \""zombie science\"" is run of the mill, with no original thought:  mindless creatures that eat human flesh, infect via saliva and bites, and are only killed by head shots.  There's no back story as to how it started (maybe in the follow up books) and nothing that really grabbed my attention.  I did finish the book, and if was that bad I would have just moved on, but while reading I couldn't wait to finish it (so I could move on, not because the story was so enthralling).<br /><br />I love zombie books that involve military themes.  This book does that to an extent but the military language is incredibly cliche and putting an explanation for every acronym or peiece of military jargon in parenthesis after, takes away from the story.  This book is absolutely no comparison to books like Tooth and Nail and The Gathering Dead, which both use military lingo, but either provide a glossary in the back, or use it in a context that makes sense to a civilian.  The \""military speak\"" in this books sounds like it was taken out of a Call of Duty video game.<br /><br />The character development isn't great, you never feel really attached to anyone.  Ya, characters die and get bit (everyone can't survive in a zombie book of course), but they seemed to do so with no real dramatic effect.  Very little foreshadowing or hints of things to come.  I could go on, but I'm starting to feel bad.<br /><br />I give the author credit, it isn't as bad as I'm making it sound, but this really just feels like a hurriedly put together book, in order to take advantage of the current zombie hype (Walking Dead etc).<br /><br />The one thing I will give credit to, is that the author is obviously right wing and no makes attempt to hide his political views.  The \""president's\"" name has the same initials and cadence to his name as our current commander and chief and also has 2 small daughters.  There are quite a few other parallels to real life as well.  I thought this was interesting and a little comical, but also seems to be the easy way out, and allows the author to write without very much original thought or story line.<br /><br />If you've burned through all the really good zombie books give this one a try, but at the same time, after reading all the really good ones, this one is going to be very boring to you.  I most likely will not move on to the 2nd and 3rd books in the series in hopes of finding a more refined author.

This is a review of the DIGITAL Collector's Edition only!,"A bit of a warning to those thinking I am giving Tera one star - that is NOT the case. I gave the game three out of five stars (check out my review below).<br />It is simply the score that the terribly lacking DIGITAL Collector's Edition is receiving. In fact, if I could give it zero stars, I would.<br /><br />All this PC Download CE version does (other than cost a lot more) is give you the following in-game items: a level 20 Regal Frostlion Mount, a level 15 Velik's Bloodstone Necklace, and a level 40 Shakan's Bloodstone Necklace.<br />You don't get any digital artwork, maps, storybooks, or in game convenience benefits (such as a store bought level one mount). This so called Collector's Edition doesn't even give you any sort of cosmetic gear/pets or exclusive voices/appearances!<br /><br />What makes this incredibly lacking package a Collector's Edition? En Masse Entertainment, I am asking you directly - why did you label this as such?<br />Coming from other digital CE's this version is quite disappointing.<br /><br />The only difference between this digital CE and the regular version of Tera is the higher price tag and three useless items... If you feel that's worth it, by all means go ahead and purchase it (thus encouraging the developer to continue with these kinds of practices).<br /><br />---------------------- My review of Tera (the base game) is below ----------------------<br /><br />Tera is an action MMORPG, where auto attacking and tab targeting have been removed in favor of a much more fluid (and interesting) combat system. The game plays very much like your standard action game, and defeating enemies requires dodging, blocking, and being mobile. While you must still use a hotbar to trigger abilities, all of them have to be AIMED by you, and can be dodged just as easily by another skilled player (not by monsters, who have terrible, terrible AI). This results in some of the best PvP action I have ever encountered.<br /><br />All is not well however, as the game has quite a few broken quests at this very moment. They recently merged all their servers into just three (the PvP only Mount Tyrannas, the PvE only Tempest Reach, and the Roleplaying server Celestial Hills). This merge created a myriad of problems and broken quests for the team at Enmasse Studios. I tried playing a freshly made toon just for the purpose of this review and found that I could not progress through the prologue because of a quest glitch. Moreover, skipping the prologue and going to the newby area, I was again halted by a quest MOB not spawning - and this once more prevented progression. There were about 20 people trying to finish this story quest (you NEED to complete them), and swearing about the game being a bug filled mess.<br />Logging on with my higher level characters, I was told there were quite a few more bugs in game after the merge (I asked in guild chat), and a lot of them impede progression.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />- Tera is incredibly gorgeous on the highest settings, of course you need a beefy computer to run it. My TimelineU M5-481TG-6814 can't handle it on medium or above, while running games like Skyrim on the high settings.<br /><br />- The combat is amazing. I love that auto attack and targeting has been removed. This is by far the best combat in any MMORPG that I have played, and I played a lot of them. The thrill you get from dynamically dodging or blocking (and countering) your opponent's attack adds a lot to the overall feel of things.<br /><br />- Environments and creature design are outstanding. Whoever created the world of Tera should be praised for a job well done. Everything from lush, rolling landscapes, to the mobs and races that inhabit it are all top notch. My only complaint about the races, is that all the females look like slutty supermodels (or borderline illegal for the Elin race).<br /><br />- There are lots of ways to customize your characters (however there are also some limitations - such as not being able to make a purely bald character).<br /><br />- Interesting progression system where you glyph your skills to modify them (there are usually quite a few choices to pick from), and lots of ways to improve your gear (crystals, enchantments, etc).<br /><br />- Fighting BAM's (big ass monsters) is incredibly fun (and they live up to their name). Killing a BAM is like hunting similar creatures in the excellent Monster Hunter games, but a bit more challenging. For all you MH fans out there, do yourself a favor and roll a Berserker - that way you should be able to solo most BAM's. That is my main, and the only character that I can solo most BAM's with (adding to the MH feel).<br /><br />- Server merges make for incredibly populated servers. There are countless players running and fighting all around you.<br /><br />- The world PvP is pretty good, and actually exists in Tera, as does GvG (Guild VS Guild) and Battlegrounds.<br /><br />- You can play for free, just like in Eve by purchasing a Chronoscrolls for in game money. You can also buy one from Amazon and sell it for in game funds. I haven't payed for Tera ever since this system was introduced a while back.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- There are generally only three quest types in Tera (of the fetch, escort, and slay variety). All MMORPG vets are familiar with these \""staples\"" of the genre. Eventually PQ's do make an appearance, but by that time it is already too late.<br />With the evolution that [[ASIN:B007VTVKG6 The Secret World]] has brought to the genre, playing Tera (or any other MMORPG for that matter just feels stale).<br /><br />- Plenty of broken quests after the server merge.<br /><br />- Grinding, grinding, and did I mention grinding? The best way to level up is still to repeat grind quests in key areas while queuing for dungeons. There is a huge drop off in the leveling speed at 40, and then again at 50. Getting up to 40 however is pretty simple.<br /><br />- The game does not deserve its M rating. It simply doesn't push the boundaries like [[ASIN:B000RZPW9W Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures]] or make you think like [[ASIN:B007VTVKG6 The Secret World]]. Other than the nude patches that are floating around the net, there is nothing too inappropriate in Tera. When a game is rated M, I expect it to handle that rating with more than just skimpy dresses.<br /><br />- Tera's story is absolute generic garbage. Everything from the poorly voiced cutscenes to the terrible text. I tried to read the whole thing my first time through, but eventually succumbed to the ultra fast \""accept quest and move on\"" mode. [[ASIN:B001CWXAP2 Star Wars: The Old Republic]] and [[ASIN:B007VTVKG6 The Secret World]] really handle this a LOT better. This is disappointing since I actually loved the Tera books.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />- Tera is dying. Unless they switch to F2P post haste, I am afraid that even the three current servers will not fill up. My guild, which consisted of hundreds of members months ago, is now down to 17-20 active ones. The merges helped quite a bit, but I don't know for how long.<br /><br />- The AI of some MOBs in this game is unbelievably laughable and makes the monsters in WoW seem like brain surgeons. You can exploit terrain and class skills to no end when it comes to certain encounters.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Honestly it would be a mistake to not try this game out. It comes with 30 days of playtime, and if you do everything right it should be the only money you will need to spend (just purchase Chronoscrolls for in game cash).<br /><br />I liked Tera at first, I really did but as time progresses and I experienced other games, I couldn't help but give the game a three star rating. If you have never played an AMMORPG before, feel free to add an extra star to my review, but with the competition being what it is - I can't recommend this game too much. In fact, if it wasn't for my addiction hunting BAM's and world bosses, I would have probably completely moved on by now.<br /><br />---------------------- My review of Tera (the base game) is above ----------------------",2012-09-19,1412,extra_long,2012-09,games

Q: Okay - anyone else? A: No.  We Came As Romans - Q: You came as Romans; however, what have you learned about yourselves during this journey? A: WE LIKE SLIPKNOT VERSES. And Lost Prophets choruses. And Linkin Park bridges, complete with piano.  I Am The Avalanche - Q: How did you end up on this sampler? It's rather unfortunate to be grouped with these bands.

A Plea For Purging - Q: In a genre that is seemingly consumed by anger, how are you able to embrace that childhood enthusiasm that so many other bands lack? A: Wow - good question! If I had to say anything, it is because CHILRDREN LIVE FOREVER! WE WILL LIVE FOREVER! CHILDREN LIVE FOREVER!!!  Blessthefall - Q: Your band name is blessthefall; did you guys fall from something? A: Yes. A very tall building. Its why are vocals are so angry.  Twin Atlantic - Q: You accuse rock and roll of being false, yet sound like The Fray with slightly heavier guitars. Is the line, \""I set my puppy on fire so I could be free\"" a way of maintaining your credibility despite having such a soft rock sound? A: This interview is over.  Flogging Molly - Q: Would you guys consider yourself Saints or Sinners? A: Sinners, obviously. We dropped an f-bomb in the first verse. Q: I think it is permitted by the Lord if the f-bomb is dropped in the name of punk rock. A: Well, we're still sinners.  Go Radio - Q: I bet you liked the Chipotle commercial where Willie Nelson sings \""The Scientist.\"" A: I sure did. Then I said goodnight to the moon.  Texas In July - Q: Why are your vocals so angry? A: BECAUSE FREEDOM ISN'T FREE. It's so hot in Texas in July? Q: Excuse me? Was that a question? A: SORRY. SOMETIMES I GET SO MAD I LOSE MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT!!!  The Story So Far - Q: I'm sorry, but I have to ask - is that really how you naturally sing? A: Yeeeeeaaaaaaaaaassssssssss! Q: But you sound so normal when your talking. A: Youuuuu haaavvvvve nooo iiideaaaaaaaaaa!  A Hope For Home - Q: How did you come up with your band name?

One detective is not certain however and decides to investigate further. While getting statements, the detective discovers the other other resident on the penthouse floor, living across the hall, is somewhat hard to get in contact with. She does not seem at home at first, but rumor has it that she has not been out of her home for 17 years. No one really knows the mystery behind  it. After the incident, she tries to get the penthouse across from her, but someone new moves in, bringing back not only memories but setting a series of events falling, like dominoes.<br /><br />Before reviewing the movie itself, I want to say that the previews I saw of this movie did not do it justice. They looked grainy and had bad sound quality, making me wonder if I should watch it. An obscure distributor added to that, and if it would not have been for the cast involved I might have missed a good film. This is Not reflective of the film itself.<br /><br />As for the movie, Columbus Circle was really good. The plot was not overly complex but was not just there to find. you needed to watch it for a bit to figure out all the pieces, and it made me want to keep up with what was going on. At first, you have a bunch of random items popping up and wonder how they all fit together. Was the woman murdered? Who is the neighbor? Why does she act the way she does? They seem connected by circumstance but the pieces start to slide in place, showing threads that hold everything together.This leads to how other elements fit in and interlock, and it makes something enjoyable. Combine that with some stuff toward the end that played out a bit different than I thought it would, marking that as a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />As far as acting here, it was quite good. I liked Selma Blair quite a bit, enjoying her portrayal as a shut-in with a mysterious fringe to her. There were some details that I might have attributed to the role as well that were not meant to be, from the way she carried herself to the application of make-up that seemed a little too thick. She really seemed to have an issue with the outside world, taking to the shadows and staring at the floor, reminding me of people I have met that are really uncomfortable with people intruding on their surroundings. Giovanni Ribisi was also good in the role of our curious Detective, moving the story along and keeping it on point. He also seems somewhat the same to me in movies, not in a bad way, but I kind of know what to expect from him. The neighbor portrayals, by Jason Lee and Amy Smart, were also well done, and Beau Bridges and Kevin Pollack also played characters that stood out as theirs but did not overshadow what was transpiring.<br /><br />If I were going to attribute a flaw, I might put it on the end. I am NOT going to spoil anything here, but want to note that a series of events in the last few minutes made me think they went against what we knew had learned throughout the film. Still, it was minor and did not take away from the film.<br /><br />I don't want to say a solid 5 stars, but it is not 4 either. 4.5/5 puts it somewhere between like and loving the film, saying it was worth the watch.

That family partnership continued on The Brothers Bloom and now on Looper. Nathan Johnson has very quickly established an identity for himself in the 5 features he has composed (3 of them directed by his cousin). Looper puts him to the test with a science fiction thriller, and those score are always tricky. However, Johnson nails it with this textured, percussive, and intriguing score. The entire sound has a sense of intrigue and mystery infused in the energy, which is never over the top or loud. It's definitely a lean and solid score.<br /><br />The score doesn't have any excess to it, and by that I mean that it really is stripped down to a few distinct elements. The percussion is the most notable characteristic of the music. This is backed with pulsating strings that drive most of the score. The score isn't all propulsive action though, and much of it in the second half is quite brooding. There is bubbling tension throughout and the music really grows on you as you listen. The intricate textures are always there, but Johnson pulls them back on some tracks to let the strings stew for a bit. The one thing that is missing from the score is emotional depth. I know this is more of a conceptual film than a contextual one, but I felt like there wasn't enough character in the music. The track \""Her Face\"" does a nice job of teasing us with a touching motif, but it quickly fades away and we're back to tick-tacks and strings. The ending is very nice though as everything comes full circle and is wrapped up superbly.<br /><br />There is some emotion in the music, but not enough for me to really grasp onto this score.

I expect a good story, engaging characters, lush, vibrant, cheesy, outdated graphics, caves everywhere, and lots of character/class choices with a learning curve that will have me replaying for weeks. But it seems things have changed a bit, as this game is very unclear and frustrating. Even for a PB product.<br />Gone are the roaming AI animals who used to stalk and prey in packs and on other packs if they crossed paths.<br />No more richly decorated rooms with tons of items to nick.<br />Gathering (herbs,items,gold) in general has been reduced<br />Hunting is no longer a skill and can be done through tools you buy/ find<br />No longer do different ores create different armors/weapons<br />Sneaking is incredibly easy (and strange) since people are no longer really sleeping in their beds as much as laying down waiting for morning<br />The npc interactions with each other is almost nil and daily activities means most npcs shops are outside their huts/houses. They never move more than 15ft from bed to work.<br />Most skill animations are gone (sawing, woodchopping, skinning, etc) and replaced with mini games (drinking, some sort of skee shooting)<br />These sort of things were kind of the 'magic' of PB games- and when removed from the game it's much less easier to forgive the some of the games very blatant shortcomings:<br /><br />As for the game, well, its ambitious. The pirate themed RPG take is interesting. The backdrops are very lush and green, sunlight streaming through the canopy, many more caves that first Risen, but that unique ability to solve a quest though combat/stealth/diplomacy is also gone.<br />It offers some unique features like having monkey/parrots as utility pets, unfortunately I couldnt make it that far.<br /><br />Combat. Plain and simple, it is terrible. Frustratingly terrible. Make you want topunch kittens terrible. Again, I will go back to my roots of Gothic and say that I had no problem using my spacebar to block even though 99% of every PC games used it for jump. This is PB, I adapted. Unfortunately you cannot adapt to a bird, a crab or any other mob in this game from stunlocking you at will. And for as long or as short as they want. You can have 100% life and a mob with 2 hits left to death can (and most likely will) turn around and hit you 8,9, 10 times in a row until you are dead. All you can do is reload and take a deep breath.<br />Which leads me to the games seconds biggest flaw: Leveling up, the haphazard way the trainers are thrown around and the basic overall sense of confusion when trying to build a character.<br />Training a weapon not only requires finding a person who trains but also that particular type of weapon. And almost all the trainers on the 2nd island are offering skills/abilities you'll never be able to learn in the given time.<br />So after many retries using various different build types (high DPS, high Toughness, high Cunning) I can tell you it doesnt matter what skills you raise, you're going to die. A lot. To terrible combat mechanics that you are all but powerless to stop. You cannot perch mobs and because of this HORRIBLE new idea of food regenerating at a snail's pace, you will go broke either buying drinks or the materials to make them. Keeping a party member around helps alleviate this but you shouldnt have to rely on bait to survive, and if you do they should never leave you. Unfortunately none of this excuses a lowly level 3 crab pecking a decked out level 23 pirate to death.<br />Maybe a patch will fix this but for now, combat is ridiculous and just silly.

Before going into the campaign itself:<br /><br />Installation was much easier than installing the original game. Probably due to the fact that, by now, you have the Origin client installed, and the DLC installs thru that. Once installed, it does NOT show up on the main list of games, and the order receipt shows \""no serial number necessary\"", so it was a little confusing at first how to actually PLAY the DLC. It doesn't appear in the main menu under \""Downloadable content\"".<br /><br />Once the DLC is installed, you \""Continue\"" an existing game, and you'll trigger a new quest to start playing the DLC. You have to be level 10 to trigger the quest, but if you've finished the OC, you should more than meet the requirements. This is rather an interesting method to activate the DLC, and I liked it.<br /><br />I was level 40 (the max), have most of my skills maxxed, and a nicely outfitted character who migrated right into the DLC campaign.<br /><br />This said, consider the rest of this review to contain possible spoilers.<br /><br />As I said, the DLC campaign is very short, and most of it revolves around building your new keep, which is a very sweet residence indeed, a miniature town. In between running the restoration quests, you complete the main story quests for Dead Kel, as many of these quests will intersect. So you'll be in the area anyways.<br /><br />One word of warning, and a definite spoiler, once you begin the final Dead Kel quest, going into his dungeon, make sure you have enough inventory space to loot every chest and pile, because once you vanquish Dead Kel, it looks like you cannot return.<br /><br />I didn't log how many hours I played until I defeated Dead Kel, but it was certainly less than 10, and probably something you can hammer out over a weekend. As I said above, since I was maxxed out on character, at no point in playing did I get that \""oh crap\"" feeling, where I was in over my head. That's kind of unfortunate, and as annoying as it is to reload an earlier save, it's all part of the challenge.<br /><br />Playing a game is not always about rushing to the end, and in this DLC, there are ongoing quests you can keep playing. These are similar to the \""tasks\"" in the OC, and entail you talking to some of the denizens of your new castle, as you dispense justice or take on other challenges.<br /><br />I have not tried to go back to the mainland of the OC, but I do know you cannot fast-travel to e.g. Rathir, so I don't know if there is a method to return...<br /><br />There was no increase to the level cap, it's still level 40, and I really didn't find any loot that exceeded what I already had, save a few pieces of armor. I did miss some of the chests, so I'll go back and loot everything I can.",2012-03-26,510,extra_long,2012-03,games

The only unique aspect here is that it's been officially commissioned by the gamemakers, given a few lines of spoken dialogue, and charged money for it.<br /><br />Mount & Blade is incredibly diverse in its modding capabilities, and over the years since its first release, has seen people mod the game to play as realistic Medieval or ancient combat, to Feudal Japanese settings, even to modern era gunpowder mods set in the American Old West or even World War II.<br /><br />This mod in particular does what I've long thought to be a fun challenge for gamemakers such as those behind the Call of Duty franchise to explore; the days when firing off a single shot was a big deal and often resorting to the bayonet was more likely to save you than stopping to reload.<br /><br />History Channel games tried this approach with their Civil War games, and avoided the need for formations or fellow soldiers by having it be \""special ops\"" type missions involving one man as a spy.<br /><br />But this mod shows that such a thing can be accomplished and can be fun.  It works out wonderfully here, it could work out amazingly well as a Call of Duty game.<br /><br />The biggest problem however is that the limitations of the historical technology would mean that more stuff would need to be added.  If gunplay is to be hindered by realistic reload times and poor firing accuracy, additional gameplay features need to be given; expanded melee combat, perhaps, specialized tasks to be accomplished, many different game modes and wider variety of weapon choices.<br /><br />This mod does the best it can with game modes like Siege, Battle, Team Deathmatch, and having the ability to change as various infantry types, cavalry, even artillerymen able to use cannons with all the proper steps---loading, cleaning the barrel, pushing the cannon forward, aiming, igniting the fuse.<br /><br />But it doesn't do enough;<br /><br />- The gunplay is identical to that used in half a dozen gunpowder mods, stepped down by having no ability to zoom in via looking down the barrel's iron sights.<br />- The melee combat is in no way changed or updated from the base game; swords and spears and bludgeoning weapons all operate exactly the same way, with a long thin sword being wielded exactly the same as a stubby dagger or a curved cavalry sabre.<br />- A lot of the weapons have little or no explanation to them.  Cavalry and infantry muskets appear to be completely identical, save that cavalry muskets have no bayonets.  Rifles appear, but are in no way faster or more accurate than muskets.  A standard (re, flag) can be used as a lance-like weapon but I've never seen it actually hurt or kill someone run down by it.  Artillerymen/engineers are given shovels that can't be used as weapons and no explanation given as to when and where they can be used for sapping.<br />- Bayonets instantly kill if they touch you.  No other melee weapon does this, not swords or spears or axes; if an enemy stabs you with a bayonet, you pretty much die instantly.<br />- All battle modes are essentially the same; as all war game shooters are likely to be, everyone wanders about on their own, hunting and killing members of opposing teams, only occasionally working together in groups of two or three, but rarely more.  While it would be impractical to get enough people to form up in a line as real Napoleonic soldiers would, there isn't even the slightest attempt to encourage such a thing, no added bonuses to accuracy or firepower to reward people for firing together en masse, no game modes that would stress this sort of gameplay.<br /><br />And despite the gameplay modes of Siege, Team Deathmatch, Battle and so on, every gamemode is basically the same; the only difference lies in patience.  If you're willing to join a gameand have to wait 10 minutes for the round to end before spawning for the first time, only to wait again if and when you die seconds after spawning (team killing is always enabled), you can join Battle mode.  Team Deathmatch allows for infinite instant respawns.  Siege mode involves one side attacking an entrenched enemy, though boredom so often gets the better of people and defenders simply go out in search of targets to kill.<br /><br />Then, the people.  As with any multiplayer game, you're liable to have to deal with people who think it's fun to teamkill, or turn their mouse sensitivity all the way up so they can spin circles around you while flailing their swords like the Tasmanian Devil, or what people in the games call \""horse noobs\"" who always pick cavalry, and always run down people from behind, a typical and legitimate tactic even in real life, yet somehow exacerbated by everyone wandering around on their own, no formations, and with bayonets barely ever scratching horses as they pass by.<br /><br />Managing to land your first shot on someone and kill them would be a giddy experience, but more often than not you'll end up frustrated not so much that your shot has missed close to point-blank range, but that your target will simply rush up to you, stabbing with their bayonet, and incessantly circling around you while strafing side to side in a way I think even real life Napoleonic soldiers in a melee would've been unable to manage while stabbing with their bayonets without tripping and falling.<br /><br />As a game mod, it is spectacularly done, though gets tiresome quickly, particularly being multiplayer-only.  As something that would cost you money, it's hardly worth the expense.  You would have a far better gameplay experience downloading a Napoleonic Wars mod available for free and fighting with an intelligent AI, more likely to fight realistically for the period.

Masterpiece Theatre created a 6-year running (2002-2008) British mystery masterpiece. They outdid themselves. This \""War Years\"" series of 19 feature-length episodes is now available as a set and thus a better price. Wow, 32 hours, of sure-to-please mystery/period drama.<br /><br />It is a 1940-45 Southern England countryside experience not to be missed.

You'll learn lots about the British WW2 home-war preparedness.<br /><br />On the other hand, FOYLE'S WAR is a series of some of the best 21st century written murder mystery stories ever presented on television--or theater. An interview bonus feature with creator/writer Anthony Horowitz proves that the dual focus--mystery/period drama--was intentional from day one. The combined perfection is \""jolly good show.\"" It's hard to believe--but, 19 episodes comprising 32 hours is simply not enough of \""Foyle's War.\"" You'll want to move from #1 through to #19 without stopping to sleep. It's that good.<br /><br />Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is a cop who'd rather be on the war front than investigating crime in Hastings, England. His cases, almost always murder, are quite involved, and never fail to end with a surprise--or two. I'll stick my neck out--Foyle's as good as Poirot. Foyle recruits help from an ex-soldier who lost a leg. Milner (Anthony Howell) manages to do much of Foyle's \""leg-work\"" on an artificial limb.<br /><br />Foyle is assigned a female driver, \""Sam\"" for Samantha Stewart. She's a gorgeous red-head with a winning, million-dollar smile. Sam is as much fun watching in the series as her real name indicates--Honeysuckle Weeks (The Rag Nymph; Catherine Cookson book/movie classic, recommended!) She wins \""Miss Congeniality\"" of the 1940s decade.<br /><br />Perfect attention is given to the period details; sets, costumes, vehicles, architecture, even down to NO yellow road lines.<br />Both Foyle and Sam speak volumes of dialogue with nothing but facial expressions. Their performances are nothing short of superb. Perfection.<br /><br />Additional guest cast members of each episode are well-known stars in their own right--following the tradition of some of the top Masterpiece Theatre productions.

I test drove most of the competitors first and was not much impressed with those either (iBank 4 being the possible exception if you can get past some of their amateurish GUI design). Eventually, I succumbed and decided to see for myself just what QEM could do for me. To my surprise it has turned out to be the ideal solution. I think this is primarily due to the fact that I use Quickbooks for Mac for my business accounting. Quickbooks handles the kind of \""heavy lifting\"" that QEM lacks which I think is what many users are looking for in QEM and find disappointing. When paired with Quickbooks, however, I've found QEM to be an ideal compliment. In fact, there are some aspects that I actually prefer to Quickbooks: the way QEM handles online banking, for example, is much better than the awkward \""stacked\"" registers in Quickbooks. QEM also manages to circumvent my bank's paid \""Web Connect\"" Quicken transaction download service with a free technique they apparently borrowed from Mint! Sweet! (I'm hoping this alternative service will soon be incorporated into Quickbooks.) From what I've also read, it appears Intuit is adding and improving functionality as many of the complaints I read from 2010 and 2011 appear to have been resolved in 2012 so I'm hopeful that future versions will keep improving. If you're like me and need a less robust application to handle personal accounting alongside the heavy lifting of Quickbooks for a business, I think you may be surprised.",2012-03-13,277,long,2012-03,software

The second installment is due in early 2013.<br />We are thrown into Brielle's world, one of sadness, fear and despair as she returns to her childhood home after a tragedy. She returns to her old high school, surrounded by kids she grew up, having only been gone two years. However, the familiarities around her do not ease her feelings of sadness, grief, guilt and loneliness.<br /><br />Brielle is instantly attracted to the new guy, Jake, who is not only physically attractive to her, but also seems to be able to relieve her despair. Jake seems to show up everywhere and eventually comes to Brielle's rescue. As Brielle begins to learn more about Jake and his guardian Canaan, she is forced to open her eyes to the supernatural. Brielle and Jake find themselves caught in the middle of a Fallen One's evil plain. Can the Angels save them? Will their faith be strengthened or broken?<br /><br />While it is a work of fiction, the book has a strong Christian core and addresses some thought provoking questions about God and faith. While Jake and Canaan have absolute faith in God and his will for their lives, Brielle has no such faith and is not sure she can have faith in God when she keeps losing those she loves. Brielle's spiritual journey in this book finds her asking questions so many have asked, through Jake, Canaan the other angels, and within herself, she finds answers to some of those questions.<br /><br />The book was a nice debut novel for Shannon Dittermore, it held my interest and kept me turning the pages. The story hooked me from the beginning and I wanted to know how it would end for Brielle and Jake. There were scenes that were wonderfully written, you could just see it completely in your mind. There were some sections that were not as complete, I had to go back and try and figure out where they were or how they got there. That said, Ms. Dittermore has a wonderful flow and writing style that I think will get stronger with each novel. I look forward to her future works.<br /><br />\""Angel Eyes\"" would be a good read for adults and teens. There's no profane language, no sexuality, there are a couple of instances of non-graphic brief kissing, it does contain violence and **slight spoiler alert** the book also addresses the all too real horror of human trafficking. The author provides a resource link at the end to learn more about the tragedy that is human trafficking ways to fight it.<br /><br />(Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this e-book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze®.com book review bloggers program.

Even in their first release, there was a thread of continuity between each track that bordered on repetitive (layered synth, soft/breathy vocals, etc.), but at the time I felt it gave the album a cohesion and defined their sound.  TBM had such amazing potential because everything seemed very original (right down to their cover art and website) and well-produced.  It's just too bad that they've squandered that potential by pigeonholing themselves into that first-album sound; what was once original seems bland and homogenized... if you've heard one CD, then you've heard them all.  There's no surprises, and disappointingly few tracks in their entire catalog that truly stand out.  I realize it's a VERY frightening idea to change a formula that was once very fresh and successful; consumers can be very fickle in that they want something new, but if it's too much of a departure from what they've come to expect, it can totally kill a career. But after 10 years of putting out the same album again and again, I think TBM needs to take a chance and change things up a bit.

This is the latest I read - and the last I will read! I got this for free, but given that the price has risen to two quid, I kind of feel I should warn potential purchasers: please, if you're wondering whether it's worth your money, at least download the sample first...  I'm not sure if the main character and his wife are autobiographical or not; the thrust (if one can call it that) of this story is that the wife is loaded, and wants her hubby to have nice things, such as a new pickup. What ensues is basically an account of various shopping trips for said pick-up, recounted in more detail than I can imagine anyone would find interesting, unless they were very obsessed with pickup shopping. So far, so lacking in plot and literary merit.  It wouldn't, however, be so painful to read if it was at least well written. But it's not. The dialogue is clunky, wooden and unnatural, and the characters would give cardboard cut-outs a bad name. The only one to have any substance at all to him is the main character/narrator, and he comes off more than a little sleazy and none too bright. He leers at his friend's young girlfriend in a way that I found distinctly, for want of a better word, icky.  Alongside all this, we then get statements such as:  \""Women will lie when it suits them or to smooth things over. They don't consider it lying and consider it to be more like tact.\""  I really hope that Eddy is writing \""in character\"", because the main character's views on women really are that antediluvian. There are several gems along these lines...  A taster of the kind of writing to expect:  \""When we got there, this salesman came out and asked how I liked the pickup. He started calling me Franklin and acted like he was my best friend. I am not stupid and know that he is not my friend. He is just trying to make a sale.\""  This is the standard of writing I would expect of a child still in primary school: I did this, then I did that, then he did that, and then that happened. I imagine, however, that most primary school children would produce something more exciting in the way of plot (I can't see most kids putting up with a story where a character spent a week shopping and did nothing else), and have less objectionable (and boring) main characters.  Essentially, this reads like someone's (rather dull) journal or diary, and how anyone thinks this is a finished story that is fit for publishing is beyond me. It's just not remotely entertaining, engaging, interesting, informative, well written, thought provoking, or any of the other things one looks for in a book, fictional or not. Besides its diminutive length, the main reason I finished the thing was in a kind of fascinated disbelief that anything this bad could actually be offered for sale.  The one positive point is that I don't think I noticed any glaring grammatical, spelling, or punctuation errors (though I'm not about to go back and check...), which is an improvement. Overall, though, the only reason this is getting one star is because Amazon doesn't allow for _no_ stars. Not worth your money, your bandwidth, or your time.  It's tempting, if you see something for free, to think, \""Oh, well for free it might be worth a read.\"" However, in this case, it's really not. I'm working my way through my Kindle archive to delete any Franklin Eddy books that still linger, so I don't make the mistake of wasting any more time reading them.",2012-02-04,654,extra_long,2012-02,ebooks

The production uses some footage of real wolves, but mostly they're a combination of really bad special effects and pretty amateurish CGI. For example, when we first see the whole pack through the reflection of their eyes outside the fire circle, they basically look like a bunch of production assistants holding pairs of LED lights (which is probably what they were) The alpha wolf in the final scene looks more like the black smoke from LOST than a wolf. I mean, the producers of \""The Ghost and the Darkness\"" were able to manage fully grown lions ina credible way, and here they can't get the wolves right?<br />So overall, a movie with a lot of promise was botched.",2012-07-23,363,long,2012-07,videos

The attempt was made to blend an indie type vibe with just enough gore and high speed car chases to try and appeal to a mass audience.  There was no acting in this movie by the two main characters, and all of the pauses and silence between them was so contrived.  The violence strewn throughout the movie was obviously the writer and producers proudest moments.  The attempt at making Gosling's character \""mysterious\"" just fell short with a quick realization that he's basically a loner with an obvious violent past as we see just how violent he can be.

I enjoyed playing the board game back when I was a wee lad - more to the point, I suppose, I enjoyed painting the miniatures - so I had high expectations for the digital version. My hopes were dashed when I actually started playing the video game. It's convoluted, overly complex, and ultimately underwhelming. More to the point: the AI cheats, and it cheats with abandon. There's no subtlety in the way the game gives AI teams an overwhelming advantage when playing the single-player campaign. The multiplayer experience is assuredly a different matter, but seeing as how I can't play online because of version conflicts, I won't be able to give a more detailed account of that (more on the conflict issue later on).<br /><br />According to hardcore Blood Bowl fanboys, everything in the game is statistically accurate, from dice rolls to team setup to random events. They cite detailed tests (tests done by hardcore players I might add), and cry foul when someone dares to claim that the game is manipulating data in order to give the AI an advantage. I won't debate the validity of either side of the argument. I can only comment on the time I've spent playing Blood Bowl, and my time in the game indicates that yes, indeed, the game does cheat. It loads dice rolls, it hands out random turnovers, and it stacks AI teams.<br /><br />Honestly, I've got no real issue with this. I've played tons of other games that do the same thing - AI cheating is a way for video game developers to cover up the fact that the mechanics they are coding into a game aren't necessarily up to snuff. In other words, it's a way for crappy developers to make crappy games. My real problem with Blood Bowl is twofold:<br /><br />First off, almost every mistake made by a player can cause a turnover. Your blocker slips on his feet? Turnover. Your quarterback drops the ball? Turnover. Your star player misses with a special ability? Turnover. Your defensive lineman fails to block an opposing runner and trips? Turnover. Kill an opponent? Turnover. Basically any game mechanic or rule that is decided with a die roll can result in a potential turnover. Considering that the majority of the game is played via die rolls, turnovers are a bloody persistent nuisance. I realize that the board game also plays by the same rules, but there is an element of luck in rolling dice that a video game will never be able to emulate, and that's why the digital version of Blood Bowl fails so spectacularly. There are ways to play this game that minimize the chance of a turnover happening, but who really cares when it's going to happen anyway? The devs should have called this game Warhammer Fantasy Turnover Simulator.<br /><br />Secondly, Cyanide (the developers) have so far released three versions of the game: the 1st Edition, the Dark Elf Edition, and the Legendary Edition. Each edition of the game can only be played online with the same version. In other words, if you own the Dark Elf Edition, you won't be able to compete with another player who happens to own the Legendary Edition. Not really a big deal until you realize that Cyanide have been selling the D.E. and Leg. versions side by side all this time. That means that consumers, unaware of the fact that there are already three incompatible versions of a game, are blindly buying the first one that pops up in their browser. Not only that, but Cyanide are releasing each new version of Blood Bowl as a full-priced standalone product - no upgrade or discount allowed for previous owners.<br /><br />Now that there's news of yet another edition of the game (the Chaos Edition) being released, that means there will possibly be four incompatible versions of the same game floating around on the internet. There is no viable excuse for this kind of manipulation; it's highly anti-consumer, and Cyanide deserve all the criticism they have received regarding this controversy.<br /><br />Fun fact: the 1st Edition of the game shipped with the Dark Elf Edition code already implemented. When enterprising 1st edition owners found they were actually able to play the Dark Elf material, Cyanide released a patch that removed said material from the game. They then released the Dark Elf Edition as a standalone at full price. What a scummy reaction from a scummy company.<br /><br />Ultimately, Blood Bowl isn't a bad game, it's just marred by horrible AI and manipulative code. That said, the developers and publisher of the game are rotten to the core. Don't support them!!! Spend your money on something else, like a colonic.",2012-02-28,796,extra_long,2012-02,games

Not personally, really, but certainly more intimately than most. She is, in fact, an Agent of Death. Much like a junior associate at any major corporation, she's fairly low on the totem pole, but she and other agents like her get their weekly assignments of impending demises. It's her job to go out and collect the recently departed souls, give them their choices, and guide them to the door.<br /><br />The Door. The one between the living and the dead, between this plane of existence and whatever is next. Maddy has no more an idea of what's beyond that door than the normal mortal. No one does until they go through it themselves, agents included. Maddy's in no rush to find out for herself.<br /><br />Pity for her, then, that someone or something wants to hasten the process along.<br /><br />When her best friend is killed and she comes face to face with the monster that killed and - god - maybe ate his soul, Maddy's horror knows no bounds. She barely survives the experience, but not before the creature tells her that he's the thing that killed her mother. And now he's coming after her.<br /><br />With a suspicious new tenant who is more gorgeous than human, a mysterious increase in demon encounters, and a sudden massive fluctuation in her own magical ability, Maddy's life is suddenly thrown into chaos. The kind that will kill her if she doesn't figure out what's going on around her, what part she has to play in it, and who she can trust. Without those answers, Maddy will end up just as dead as those she guides.<br /><br />~*~<br /><br />It seems I can't crack an urban fantasy book lately without brushing up against some sort of angel mythos. That wouldn't be a problem if I liked angel mythos, but it's not my favorite thing. I don't hate it, but it's very hit-and-miss for me. In this one it was more of a miss, but part of my problem with it in this case was the confusion created by the delivery, as opposed to the proposed mythos itself.<br /><br />There was a lot going on in the plot of this book, a couple of different factions trying to put an end to Maddy's life, and a lot of people creating chaos in that life. It certainly made it hard to keep the rules of the world straight, because the Bad Guys don't follow them, yet Maddy was often held accountable for them. I wish the story had been a little more streamlined, or that some of the developments had been held off for later books. I think it would've helped both with my big picture comprehension and with the overall appeal of the book.<br /><br />I didn't mind Maddy as the lead character, so that's a plus. She was fairly standard for the genre with her irreverent nature and her trouble with authority. Much more wise-ass than bad-ass, but I have to admit, I'm a fan of the snark. Her gargoyle Beezle provided some amusement as a secondary character, too, but her new tenant Gabriel didn't really work for me as the love interest. His backstory was interesting, but I didn't feel the chemistry that I was being told existed between him and Maddy. Instead I felt a bit emotionally manipulated by their relationship restrictions.<br /><br />A few things about the story threw me off. I thought Maddy's reaction to her friend's death was oddly unremarkable. Her sudden power upgrade struck me as not only too convenient but also a bit contrived, and gave her a vibe that tread dangerously close to being Mary Sue. I didn't like the sudden declaration from her boss at the end, either. That came out of nowhere and just seemed to muddy already heavily muddied waters.<br /><br />Muddy water actually about sums up how I feel about the whole read. There was nothing I could point to and say that it was unequivocally bad or that I didn't like it, per se, but there wasn't anything of particular merit that stood out as unabashedly awesome, either. The story was a little muddy, the characters a little pedestrian, and the mythos a little convoluted and not to my personal taste. Itwas, for me, just an okay read.<br /><br />~*~*~*~<br />Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",2012-01-31,732,extra_long,2012-01,ebooks

We had been studying the life of Moses, and used this as a culminating activity. The 30 K-6th grade students just loved it. They're pretty active, and this was the most engaged I've seen them all year.  We previewed it, and explained to them before the viewing that a lot of the story was out of the Bible, and some was just Hollywood, making an exciting story. There's a scene at the beginning about Moses life as a young man in the Egyptian court that is fantasy. The kids were so excited when the film got to the burning bush scene. They watched for the plagues when the DVD got to that part.<br />The teachers agreed that these kids will definitely remember the Moses story from the DVD. This movie was a nice change of pace from our usual activities.<br />I would definitely preview and talk to children about what's in the Bible and what is written into the story. It was interesting to look in the Bible for details, and it might even be a good activity to get older kids into critiquing this and separating fact and fiction.",2012-04-02,206,long,2012-04,videos

The cut out material has the answers,"This review is based on the Amazon Instant Video HD version (I mention this because you don't get the extra material at the end in the Standard Def. version) I can't believe all the people that said they are big fans of the Alien movies that said this movie has nothing to do with that series. The Aliens in this movie are the same aliens that were found in the first movie. I'm referring to the dead alien found in the pilots chair inside the alien space ship. They don't look the same because the alien in the first movie was wearing a space suit. The same space suit that is seen at the first encounter with the aliens in this movie. To make this more clear, in this movie  there are 2 alien life forms in the movie. A human like alien and a monster like octopus alien that starts out like a worm. This movie takes place before the first Alien movie. Another misconception is the one where the humans had touched the alien goo, and how dumb that was. Watch the movie again but more closely this time. It's the android that does all the touching of the alien substances . I didn't see this movie in the theater because of all the criticisms. And I have to admit that the previews made the movie look dumb. But after I saw it I thought it was mostly misunderstood. But I had the advantage of reading the reviews and I was looking for what was said regarding the dumb things that were reported. As my title says, after the credits there are scenes that were cut out and should not have been that show a more recognizable alien bursting through the chest of the human like alien. As stated in the first Alien movie, these creatures take on DNA from their host that changes their appearance. So what you see in this movie as far as the octopus like creature becomes the aliens that were in all the other movies. I've got enough spoilers in my review and I'm sorry for that but I thought there was to much confusion (and intentional misdirection from Dir. Scott) to just review the movie. There have been a number of poorly made Alien Vs Predator movies recently and that's probably why Mr Scott said that this wasn't another Alien movie like the previous ones.<br /> So do I recommend this movie? Well if you know the difference between interesting SIFI and Horror SIFI, then I would say it's good interesting SIFI. But if your looking for a movie more like Aliens where the monster aliens eat everybody, or turn them into incubator's hanging from slim covered walls, and lots of machine gun action and space marines then your out of luck. Mr Scott has made a movie that's more like there were no other sequels to Alien until this one. I would suggest anyone that wants to make more sents of this movie watch the first one again, then this one and rather then paying close attention to the action, and all the other visual attractions, listen to and remember what's being said. you'll find there some interesting connections.",2012-10-10,538,extra_long,2012-10,videos

That doesn't exist in the remake, I barely had my popcorn ready as my wife and I sat down to a horror movie night when the fact that there was a vampire and everyone accepted that fact and decided to kill it was revealed.  Everything seemed so unnecessarily rushed just to get to the action scenes that it took away from the story.  I'm not against remakes or re-imagings but I left this movie thinking that it would have been so so so much better if they had just stuck to the original script.  The acting was good and the special effects were......well, they actually weren't that great, but they were good enough.

One was for an 'album,' and one for the 'song'. They were both the same download. Once I posted my review on the OTHER page, Martika petitioned Amazon to take down that listing so no one could see it. Pathetic! Here is my review in it's entirety, as well as a link to where you can see the amazon page for the previous listing that contained my review (it is no longer available in search results.) Note on THAT review that I am an \""Amazon Verified Purchase\"" meaning I purchased and own this song and am not just some random hater.<br /><br />----<br />Martika fans are loyal to a fault. Many of us grew up with her as a child performer on the Disney program \""Kids, Inc.\"" where she displayed her considerable talents as a singer. (When she went on to become a solo artist my mother would often say 'You could tell when you watched that she was the one who would get famous'.) Her 1988 self-titled debut spawned a #1 single with the ballad \""Toy Soldiers,\"" and many press outlets said she was poised to become the new Madonna. Her 1991 follow up album \""Martika's Kitchen\"" had a few top 200 charting songs but didn't live up to the success of the debut, despite having songs penned by Prince.<br /><br />...and then for all practical points and purposes, she dropped off the face of the Earth.<br /><br />Loyal fans have quickly gleamed onto the various projects in which she has popped up over the years. In the late 90's demo tracks from a never-released album called \""The Journey\"" surfaced and they weren't so great. Eminem sampled \""Toy Soldiers\"" on a successful rap song and to capitalize on it Martika's former label released several versions of a greatest hits compilation.<br /><br />Then, in the mid 2000's, Martika surfaced with her (alleged) husband, a former 80's singer himself named Nikki who had a #21 hit on the Billboard charts with a song called \""Notice Me\"". Now going by Michael Mozart, the two formed a pop rock duo called Oppera and self-released two albums that received virtually no critical attention. The music was awful, but again Martika's fans supported her even as her behavior got weirder and weirder.<br /><br />In 2007, seemingly out of nowhere, a website appeared for a new television show called \""J8ded\"". Starring Martika (now going by the stage name Vida Edit) and her husband (now going by Michael Daemon,) the show was billed as a dark comedy-cum-military drama centering around a rock and roll duo (guess who) who are thrown out of England when one of them insults the Queen Mother. For several years alleged release dates for the show were put up, and as loyal fans waited patiently some controversy surfaced. People working on the show - actors, behind the scenes crew and even makeup artists - made allegations that they were promised pay that never came. Restaurants used for location filming and studios rented for production claimed they too were unpaid or made empty promises.<br /><br />After claims first that the show would be on TV, then that it would be on iTunes, finally a private website was set-up for the show. Fans were made to pay a monthly subscription fee to watch (not download) episodes of the show which generally took a month each to be uploaded. And they were painfully bad. Combinations of stock footage and incredibly low budget home-video-style filming were combined with terrible acting and a complete lack of plot. Around this time Martika also gave a video interview in which she claimed she would never record under the Martika name again, and that the reason she had been out of the industry for so long was a spiritual one.<br /><br />After four episodes of J8ded were available, suddenly the websites, Facebook page and Twitter page for the show disappeared without a trace. Instead Martika - now using her original stage name (her birth name is Marta) - began hyping an alleged music project. With no mention of her husband, she began uploading blog entries, tweetsand video snippets claiming that a new single - \""Flow With the Go\"" - would be out on January 12, 2012 followed by a full-length album - \""The Mirrorball\"" - on February 12.<br /><br />Fans who had stayed loyal despite a rocky road, to put it mildly, began getting excited. This would be the first Martika solo music released since 1991 - 21 years of waiting! The same dubious posts that came up during J8ded's production continued; allegations of an association with the Fairlight company (which the company denied,) posts by Facebook profiles that were clearly fake identities in order to hype the material anonymously... all of this was overlooked by fans.<br /><br />January 12th arrived and a post came up on Facebook - \""Flow With the Go\"" was finally released! Except that no one could find it anywhere to download or listen to. Then began a string of posts about how the song was 'propagating' to various websites, and that although it was 'released' it could take up to two weeks to actually become available. Of course the truth was that Martika was self-releasing this song, probably through CDBaby, and that if you use such a site to sell a track it does in fact take weeks from the date you actually upload it to them to become available to the public.<br /><br />Fans grew restless, posting inquiries and complaints on Martika's Facebook and Twitter page. Martika began removing the comments and blocking these fans, claiming that she only wanted 'positivity and light'. Of course what she really meant was that she wouldn't allow anyone to expose her deceptions and fabrications because she desperately wanted to be taken seriously as a viable recording artist. FINALLY, three weeks after the alleged release date, the song became available for download and purchase. FINALLY the wait was over; 21 years of fan devotion had paid off.<br /><br />And then we got THIS piece of crap.<br /><br />\""Flow With the Go\"" is so terrible it is insulting. Martika, unquestionably a talented vocalist, barely sings at all on the song instead opting for fast-paced lyrics with almost no actual melody. What once was a voice that soared to great heights now sounded like Britney Spears after a long night of partying. And the lyrics - oh, the horror! \""Sunny day, keeping the clouds away\""...\""Ding Dong, King Kong!\""...\""I'm shakin' it! I'm fakin' it!\"" The absolute dregs of dance music. It's as if a fourth grader threw darts at her journal and then assembled a song from the lines she hit.<br /><br />The music itself plays like the remix of a Backstreet Boys song that never got any club play. Comprised mostly of samples it, much like the vocal, has nearly no melody and instead drones along. The ultimate effect is that of a song self-recorded by a singer whose natural singing talent has been restrained, and who obviously relied on excellent pop songwriters and producers back in her heyday to create quality material.<br /><br />Yet through all of this horrible tripe fans still hang on. Look at the very reviews on this Amazon page to see the nonsense being spewed by Martika fans who would probably praise her if she released a song that was made up entirely of samples of her farts. One review points out the \""spirituality\"" in the lyrics. And I quote from the song: \""It's my duty 'cause I'm rooty tooty fresh and fruity with an apple butter booty.\"" DEEP.<br /><br />Fortunately enough fans are catching on that the idol they have loved for so long is truly gone. From the creepy 'promotional photos' of her sitting spread eagle in front of a fridge while unbuttoning her shirt to the ongoing posts on Facebook attempting to make it sound like she's actually signed to a label, they are giving up on Martika. If the future of her music is as revolting as \""Flow With the Go,\"" they are making the right choice.<br /><br />(As a final note, the full length album \""The Mirrorball\"", with the aforementioned release date of February 12th, 2012 is nowhere to be found. Martika no longer mentions it on any social media. No other songs have been discussed, no samples put out, and questions from fans about it are ignored if not outright deleted. As of this review it is already a month later than the alleged release date.)<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW APPEARS AT: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00750IY4M/ref=docs-os-doi_0",2012-03-22,1435,extra_long,2012-03,music

But the past two episodes seem to be showing a neutered Abby.  Instead of her usual pointing out everything the girls did wrong and breaking them down until they are reduced to a pile of tears, she now tells the camera she noticed a few thing they did wrong, but it was okay.  Then she goes into the dressing room and asks them how they feel about their performance.  Then she tells them they did great.  Now I'm not saying I want her to scream at the kids or belittle them, but this is not the Abby we have come to love.<br /><br />  I also feel that this episode was either badly edited or badly scripted.  Take your pick.  When Abby was at the front desk with her assistant getting the costumes ready, the conversation between them seemed to come out of nowhere.  All of the sudden they are talking about how the other moms are going to cause Melissa to loose it if they don't stop bothering her.  But up until this episode there hasn't really been any mention about her secret engagement for a few episodes.<br /><br />  Melissa's breakdown seemed to be an overreaction to the other moms' curiosity.  They didn't seem like they were meddling. They were asking a bunch of questions, but the way it was edited, made it seem like they each had fifty questions that they all wanted to ask her at once.  Very staged.  The way that Melissa sat next to the other moms and strategically placed her hand out so the other moms would see she wasn't wearing her ring was definitely staged.  But to call your lawyer and have the other moms threatened with a lawsuit?  Really? They all happened to have the letters at lunch and pulled them out at the same time.  It actually reminded me of Pretty Little Liars.  The only thing missing was the eerie music.  Then Abby took it out on the other girls after Melissa tried to pull Maddy and Mackenzie out of the class because she can't take it anymore.  She ran down telling Abby \""they're doing it again\"".  And Abby says the other moms are actinglike teenage drama queens.  Give me a break.  Then Abby screamed at the other girls to tell their moms to mind their own business.  She let them know that the two things you never talk about are weddings and divorces.  Wasn't it Abby that was trying to get information out of Melissa's girls in the episode with the wedding dance?<br /><br />  It must have been a slow day for taping.  I know that most reality shows including this one have some scripting, but usually it flows. Oh and I won't even get started on the Candy Apple Cathy drama.  This episode was choppy in the storyline.  The topics were so random.  The conversations were random. And the cast seemed to be acting in this episode.  Oh and Holly has completely changed in two episodes.  Seems like with Jill gone she has to become the pushy stage mom.  And she even took a leave of absence from her job.  Yep it has to be scripted.",2012-03-22,533,extra_long,2012-03,videos

As I'm more inclined to watch ghost stories, finding psychological motivation (sadness, betrayal, untimely death, etc.) behind paranormal activity more stimulating to view in a film than just a series of shocking visuals thrown together, I don't mind that. If you don't want a movie filled with foul language (it doesn't matter to me one way or the other, but it does to some people, so that's why I bring it up), this could be the film for you. There's no nudity in it. By today's standards, the shock value of what few graphic scenes that there are is very minimal. I can't say that I jumped or was even surprised once while viewing this, let alone did it scare me or even stay w/ me for a bit afterwards. It isn't a movie that's likely to make you keeping lingering over the details when you're done watching it.<br /><br />I found myself viewing the film from an actor's standpoint, at least in terms of the protagonist's character. I thought he could've been a little bit more \""animated\"" in places, and in the beginning, he was just downright boring- but, overall, this wasn't a horrifically-acted film. Carlos Leon, while no Olivier, was certainly passable in playing the main characters' boss, and was a sympathetic guy here. Leon has a surprising \""presence\"" to him, which is about the only thing that stood out to me in the movie. The girl who played the main character's on-again, off-again girlfriend, while attractive enough, wasn't anyone who'll sets the world on fire. Again, she gave a passable performance, but not memorable. Character development was quite one-dimensional here, so I don't necessarily fault the actors- but better actors could've perhaps bumped this from a two-star movie to a three-star film.<br /><br />I did think that the movie (unsurprisingly, considering who made it) was very similar in setting to \""Dark Water\"", though was less effective in the creepiness department. I didn't find \""Dark Water\"" scary, either, but at least it was slightly better at character development & plot than this was- not great, but better. Hoepfully, that'll give you a point of reference (if you've seen Dark Water, that is!) If you're expecting something as good as \""The Grudge\"" or \""The Ring\""- look elsewhere! This is a low-budget flick, and could pass for a made-for-television one (which maybe it was & I just don't know it). It's not the worst film I've ever seen, and I've most definitely seen worse acting & plots in my life. The main character was easy enough to empathize with after a bit.

Hoepfully, that'll give you a point of reference (if you've seen Dark Water, that is!) If you're expecting something as good as \""The Grudge\"" or \""The Ring\""- look elsewhere! This is a low-budget flick, and could pass for a made-for-television one (which maybe it was & I just don't know it). It's not the worst film I've ever seen, and I've most definitely seen worse acting & plots in my life. The main character was easy enough to empathize with after a bit.

He was alone. Much to his dismay, the function had ended late. What had it been? A Mozart concerto? A Beethoven piano recital? Or perhaps a Bruckner symphony? He could no longer remember as he sipped away on his 1975 Veuve Clicquot. Still, the bottom-line had undoubtedly improved. Exhaustion was in floodtide and his accountants awaited him in the morning. For a moment the septuagenarian thought he could hear a snatch of the Elgar Cello Concerto but it was soon drowned out by the blare of traffic.<br /><br />All of a sudden, a voice addressed him vehemently in German.<br /><br />\""Daniel, Daniel - why are you persecuting me?\""<br /><br />Barenboim stared at the bottle of champagne and then smelt its neck: there was nothing awry.<br /><br />\""Daniel, Daniel - why are you persecuting me?\""<br /><br />An unearthly light bathed the interior of the limousine. Barenboim blinked. Sitting opposite him was the ghost of Wilhelm Furtwangler.<br /><br />\""Maestro - welcome! It's good to see you after all this time! But why are you saying such a thing? I'm your most dedicated advocate!\""<br /><br />Furtwangler's brow was more furrowed than a wheat field.<br /><br />\""Drop the niceties, Daniel! Stop trying to recreate my conducting style! Let me rest in peace! I can't stand it anymore! It's hateful!\""<br /><br />\""But Maestro - it is true. I've studied your recordings ad infinitum. I try to mirror your spontaneity in my approach to any score, as if the work is being composed in the act of performance. I'm flexible with tempi. Do you know that I've won seven Grammy Awards over time?\""<br /><br />\""Daniel, how can I put this diplomatically?\"" The ghost paused. \""You are a solid B-Minus grade conductor. To ape my mastery is one thing; to embody it in depth is another. There are times when you'll ace it on the night as in your Bruckner Ninth with my old orchestra. At other times, you'll be pussy-whipped by that dunce Zubin Mehta. That doesn't sound like mastery to me!

And yet you are unable to elicit anything more than a `coin-in-the-slot' response from the Orchestra de Paris.

It should be an embarrassment to this band given their long history of high-quality recordings.  It also should be a source of huge embarrassment to Neil Peart who's got such a penchant for stating that he's playing time after time for the Howard Roarks out in the audience.  Not this time.<br /><br />Leaving the awful audio sludge quality aside, this song is an engineering cut-and-paste disaster.  It's got a high-school recording class feel to the final product.  The biggest problem is the number of band flams throughout.  A band flam occurs when all the performers are supposed to strike a note at exactly the same time, but don't.  In a lot of tunes this happens on the 1-beat of a new measure -- everybody is supposed to hit that note with a lot of power and usually the drums will play kick drum with crash cymbal.  Or elsewhere it'll be some repeated hits with kick drum and choked crash cymbal or choked hi-hat.  This is a Rush staple.  In this song the guitar is just slightly off from the kick/bass/cymbal in way more instances than should happen.  It's like a high-performance engine not firing all the spark plugs simultaneously.  They're subtle and not that easy to hear, but if you're listening for them you hear it every time and the loss of power in the music is instantly noticeable.<br /><br />Not to address these problems, along with all the other cut-and-paste problems, with a professional recording like this one should be considered unforgivable.<br /><br />Here's a list of all the recording problems I found after a few listens:<br />0:43 - Band flam.<br />0:53 - 0:54 - just a mess of everybody's out of time.<br />1:15 - Band flam.<br />1:37 - 1:39 - Band flams.<br />1:43 - 1:45 - drum fill out of time w/gtr.<br />1:45 - Band flam.<br />1:55 - Band flam.<br />2:06 - 2:08 - Band flam.<br />2:15 - drum fill out of time w/gtr.<br />2:19 - Band flam.<br />2:30 - Obvious vocal distortion.<br />2:33 - Obvious vocal drop-in (lossof natural vocal continuity).<br />2:35 - Band flam.<br />2:47 - Band flam.<br />3:18 - Band flam.<br />3:29 - 3:33 - Band flam (the band-in at 3:34 is actually pretty good here, though.

It's really very simple to kill a senator if you follow the plan exactly as explained in this book. All you need to do is follow these few simple steps:<br /><br />a) Find a millionaire who wants to disappear and help him fake his death and take someone else's identity (you need to kill someone else first).<br />b) Have this millionaire give you all his money and, then, you give some of it back to him with the condition that he must create an environmental protection lobbying group.<br />c) Have this group expand all across the country and manipulate all their members to raise donations, then have all of them agreeing to defraud the government and launder part of those donations and give them back to you.<br />d) With that money you then create another group, this time of eco-terrorists willing to do any type of criminal act.<br /><br />All of the above is fairly simple and only takes a few years to accomplish. Once this is ready, then:<br /><br />e) Infiltrate the FBI and make sure you control a couple of key agents.<br />f) Find a friend of the senator who is ultra rich and owns a development company that your eco terrorist group can target. It helps if the senator owes his life to this friend.<br />g) Locate a high official of this development company with a skeleton in the closet. Make sure you have enough dirt on this person to force him to betray the company and the boss.<br />h) Find an ambitious reporter who would do anything to forward her career, even if it involves abetting a terrorist group.<br />i) Find an airhead actor willing to organize a mob and assault a convention.<br /><br />This second part you should be able to accomplish in just a month or two and for that all you need is to be the owner of a large media company.<br /><br />With all this in place, you are ready for the master stroke:<br /><br />a) Initiate a series of eco terrorist attacks on thementioned development company, garner national media attention (after all you own a media company) and bring the company to the brink of bankruptcy. Force the owner of the development company to organize a convention to discuss possible solutions to avoid this type of attack and make sure the senator is invited to attend (after all the senator is a friend and the problem now has national attention). Have the reporter be in place during the convention while the actor shows up with a mob of eco friendly activists and fake a riot. Hire a couple of killers to pose as security guards and, in the melee created during the riot, all you need to do is shoot the senator. Simple, clean, beautiful.<br /><br />It's all very simple and if you follow the plan to a T, nothing can go wrong. Unless... one of the members of the environmental organization finds out about the evil plot and happens to be in love with the ex of the millionaire who faked his death (who is his boss by the way). This by itself is not a big problem but if the ex happens to be the daughter of the senator and also the god daughter of the development company mogul, then things get dicey. But, really, what are the chances of that happening.<br /><br />Silly me, I would just hire an assassin to kill the senator while leaving home. After all is just a senator, not the president, and security wouldn't be that tight. But that would never work, too many variables involved. What if the senator chooses to leave home at a different time that day? The whole plan would fail. Better to go with a sure thing.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was very entertaining, if foolish, and made me laugh a lot.<br /><br />ps: The author also makes a feeble attempt at introducing some thoughts about environmental groups, electoral campaign policy and even faith, but this book is not good enough to take any of them seriously.",2012-04-02,700,extra_long,2012-04,ebooks

I am thinking it really needed another 6 to 12 months of content development, beta testing, bug fixing, and polishing.<br /><br />*  To few zones, and the zones are VERY small, with grinding the same content repeatedly (almost all the Main and Side quests are 'dailies') needed to actually build a character.<br /><br />*  Quest model where you can only have 1 Main / 3 Side / 1 Dungeon / 1 Story is, in my opinion, just a mechanic to drag out the time needed to play a zone.  One should note that even though when you complete a quest, you (sometimes) get the completion reward on-the-spot via mail type mechanic, you STILL need to go back and pickup a new quest anyway.  95% or more of your 'game' time will be spent running from point to point.<br /><br />*  Really not much choice in progression.  Choose a weapon, grind all the SP/AP to build that weapon. Rinse and Repeat.  More grinding.  There really is no choice, other than what weapon to start on first.

This will be the last.<br /><br />This is the first time I've experienced a real software failure - and it relates to filing multiple states.  First, the company charges way too much for the second state - $40 if I remember correctly.<br /><br />Then, when putting in your W-2 into the system as filed with the IRS, your state returns will count the income on your W-2 twice.  So if you made $50k and note two states where the income was taxed, the software doubles the income amount to $100k on both of your tax returns.<br /><br />I spent 2 hours on the phone with HR Block tech support.  The first one hung up on me after 20 minutes because he couldn't figure it out.  Maybe his call center stats looked bad.  The second gentleman, who was very nice, actually replicated the problem on his end.  He said he had never seen the software do that, but provided a case ID and was looking into it.  He suggested that I contact the HR Block tax help - just a small (ha ha ha) $20 fee to ask 1 question.<br /><br />So I contacted the HR Block tax \""professional\"" via their messaging system and here's the question I wrote:<br /><br />I am using HR Block @ Home Deluxe.  I am a \""state1\"" resident working in \""state2\"". My W-2 includes a box 15 / 16 / 17 for both \""state1\"" and \""state2\"".<br /><br />Box 16 for both \""state1\"" and \""state2\"" are the same amount - these amounts match box 1 - total Federal Wages. I have withholdings for box 17 in both states.<br /><br />When I enter both states into the W2 entry screen and put wages into box 16 of both states - my state returns double the amount of income that I actually had. As an example, if I had box 1 wages of 50,000 and I enter 50,000 in box 16 for \""state1\"" and 50,000 in box 16 for \""state2\"", my \""state1\"" and \""state2\"" returns show total income of 100,000.<br /><br />If I show the wages only related to 1 state, the software does not allow me to file electronically.<br /><br />So how doI properly report my wages for my state returns, and how do I get the software to recognize the proper way to treat the income so it isnt doubled on my state returns.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />and here was their most excellent response:  Name hidden to protect the not so innocent...<br /><br />I can't see your return as you are using an at home version. What you need to do is file a \""state2\"" non resident return and a \""state1\"" resident return. Prepare the nonresident state first so the income flows properly. It shouldn't be doubling the income - it should just be reporting what your wages were - whatever your amount in box 17 is.<br />You may have to exclude the income if you can't figure out how to get it off your return any other way.<br />See if everything still transfers over correctly.<br /><br />Returns with multiple states are complex. If you are unsure of the accuracy of your return you can use H and R Block's Best of Both program. With Best of Both you prepare the return then send it to a tax professional for review and filing. I would be honored to provide that service for you. If you would like, you can request me as the tax advisor for review of the return.<br /><br />My name is \""the incredible unhelpful tax consultant\"" from the H&R Block located in \""a state really far away from state 1 or state 2\"".<br /><br />I am currently a Tax Advisor IV. I have been working at H&R Block for 7 years.

Have a great day!<br /><br />\""the incredible unhelpful tax consultant\"", Tax Advisor IV<br /><br />____________<br /><br />So I'm essentially using the software to fill in the forms with the right numbers, then will have to print and file manually since the software sees these as \""over rides\"" and won't allow me to file electronically.<br /><br/>Thank you HR Block, for you inability to make software that works.",2012-04-11,751,extra_long,2012-04,software

US,20143941,R18OP6DIF3OUQH,B007USGD60,921177771,Adobe Photoshop Extended CS6 Student and Teacher Edition,Digital_Software,4,11,12,False,False,"Great software, once you get it to install properly","I use Photoshop mostly to process digital camera pictures (JPEG), to prepare images to use in PowerPoint for lectures, and occasionally to process microscope images and to prepare labeled figures in TIFF format for scientific publications/grant proposals. I've been using Photoshop 7.0 for many years and finally decided it was time to put it to rest and upgrade to something more appropriate for my new Windows 7 computer. Now that I have CS6 working fine on the computer, I am really enjoying it and still discovering new features nearly every day. But it was a rather complicated procedure to get there. So overall, I would give it five stars for features and performance but only two to three stars for ease of installation due to the problems I ran into.<br /><br />Part 1 - Getting it to work:<br /><br />I have to admit that I made it somewhat more complicated by purchasing CS5 the first week of May and requesting the free complimentary CS6 upgrade download when it came out. To get CS6 to properly run on my computer, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling twice (seems to be the standard help suggestion, but didn't do anything to fix my issues) and got exasperated enough to do a system restore at one point and start over.<br /><br />I ran into two main issues:<br /><br />1) I could not get files to open with Photoshop by right-clicking on them as I had been able to with PS7. I was able to open files from within Photoshop, but neither CS5 nor CS6 showed up as selectable options in the list of programs to open files with on right-click. My usual workflow when processing pictures downloaded from my camera is to sort through them with Windows Live Photo Gallery and then right-click and open the ones I select to edit. So this was a significant complication as I now had to browse to and open the file from within Photoshop to be able to edit pictures. Looking for solutions online, this seemed to be a fairly common problem with CS5/CS6 installations on computers previously runningPS7. It took me quite a while though to find a fix that worked (most \""solutions\"" posted were unhelpful) and ultimately I had to manually change a registry key that was still pointing to my old PS7 program. Once I had pointed that key to the new program, I was then able to right-click and open files in CS6. I would hope for any new program installation that it should not require manually messing with the registry on the computer to make it work properly.<br /><br />2) I also had weird display issues with \""transparent\"" type checkerboard fill patterns and thumbnails overlaying part of my images in CS6. This only occurred after I upgraded from the CS5 to the CS6 version, I did not see it when testing CS5. Again, searching online it seemed not uncommon to run into this problem with CS6. The fix was to download and install an updated driver for my video card. My computer isn't that old yet, so I was surprised to find that CS6 would not work properly without updating the video card driver. It seems this program requires the very latest drivers or it won't display properly.<br /><br />So I would rate my installation experience maybe two to three stars at best due to these issues. It took me a significant amount of time troubleshooting to get the program working. These issues may not occur with a brand-new and \""clean\"" computer that has never had any previous Photoshop version installed, but I doubt this would be the case for most people buying Photoshop CS6.<br /><br />Part 2 - Now that it works:<br /><br />CS6 seems to open and run faster than CS5, which by comparison acted rather sluggish before the upgrade. So performance seems to have improved. My first impression when opening the program was that CS6 looks too dark and my first instinct was to change the background back to the lighter gray I was used to with the older Photoshop version. The darker look is growing on me though and overall the interface looks much sleeker and does a nice job of presenting the pictures.<br /><br />So far I'm really enjoying exploring all the features in CS6. Jumping to CS6 from PS7 comes with a steep learning curve, but I was expecting that. I still find myself searching for certain functions that I used in the old program that have been moved around, but mostly I'm able to eventually find them or figure out alternative features that do a much better job. I'm missing a good manual for the program, so I'm sure there are many features that I'm still overlooking right now. It does everything I need it to do though, including working well with my ancient HP flatbed scanner once I figured out how to connect to it (File - Import - WIA Support).<br /><br />I love the new crop tool and the overlays it provides as compositional aids (rule-of-thirds, triangle, golden spiral etc). The content-aware functions are fun to play with and generally give very good results. I also love the ability to merge and stack images in Photoshop now. I have in the past used free software such as CombineZM for focus stacks or Microsoft ICE for panoramics. Now I can do all that in Photoshop and the results look very pleasing. I would not have figured out how to do the focus stacking though without finding an online tutorial for it. I'm also enjoying playing with the HDR function on occasion, but this is totally new to me since I have not used any other HDR program before (my camera does not provide RAW files).<br /><br />Overall, the program is feature-rich and performing reliably now after ironing out the issues mentioned above. So I would give it five stars for performance and features. It does have a steep learning curve, but is intuitive enough that I can do most of what I want with it without having detailed instructions (some experience with older Photoshop versions will help). I'm looking forward to learning more about how to use it to its full potential.",2012-07-03,1037,extra_long,2012-07,software

I was disappointed - this is very, very basic information about sea myths, sea gods and goddesses, and sea magic.  It is truly an *introduction* to sea magick for beginners, but I don't know that I'd call it much of a reference for anyone who's dealt with or read about sea magick or sea witchcraft before.<br />It's well-written, but I get the sense this would have been better off as a section in a larger book, or as a pamphlet, rather than a stand-alone book.  As another reviewer noted, the poetry seems to be just filler.  The myths are the standard sea myths that I've read in fairy tales, so there wasn't anything new there, either.<br />I would also have been interested to see the author source the tables of correspondence that she presented - where did they come from?

The novel's author, Oliver Pötzsch, is a true Bavarian decedent of Schongau Hangmen, specifically the famous Kuisl dynasty. The story is fictionalized, but the Kuisl family - from main character Jacob to wife and children - are all 100% real decedents of the author. This is a well-researched novel.<br /><br />Right away I was drawn into this world. The town of Schongau is a character in the book. Its grime covered streets and chamber pot stink are reminders that this isn't our time. This is a time of long ago, the time of hangmen and witch trials and the Bubonic Plague. The author perfectly describes this setting and draws you into this location.<br /><br />Right away you feel empathy for the main characters. They are only a few people, of learning, surrounded by many who are stuck in a Dark Age mentality and blame everything on the supernatural. The main character is the hangman, Jacob Kuisl. Jacob is responsible for torturing those thought responsible for crimes, until they've confessed. His next step is to brutally kill them, whether by chopping their heads off, burning them or breaking them on the wheel. For a strong, learned man, Jacob's job is hard on his heart, but necessary in the time period. Believe me, you'll grow to love and respect the hangman as his daughter, Magdelena does and his sidekick Simon Fronweiser does.<br /><br />The Hangman's Daughter is darker than a typical mystery, with child murders and witchcraft leading us down a dark mysterious path. Jacob and Simon work together to solve a mystery that has put children and a midwife in grave danger. The abuse, murder and torture are perfectly described and never overwhelming in a way that is gross or tormenting to read. It only teeters on horrific, as it is a tale of mystery. Also, it is often humorous in a Sherlock Holmes kind of way. In fact, I was reminded of Holmes and Watson oftentimes during my reading, especially in the second half.<br /><br />This novel was great until about 3 quarters of the way in, when I started to wish it would end. Everyone was a suspect in the beginning, but as Jacob and Simon begin to put the pieces together, so does the reader. When you've figured it out, you're kind of just waiting for it to resolve. Don't get me wrong, it's very well-written. It simply has a tendency to drag on. By the time it did end, I was relieved, as I was tired of reading it. That's an unfortunate response to such a good book, but it's also my personal truth.<br /><br />All-in-all, The Hangman's Daughter was interesting. I don't spend a lot of time reading mysteries anymore and it helped me to remember how much I love this genre. I am excited to read the next in the series, The Dark Monk.",2012-07-05,492,long,2012-07,ebooks

The AC series is engaging, beautiful, fun, and sometimes challenging.  In my review, I want to focus on a few gameplay mechanics that kind of made/broke the gaming experience for me. Story-wise, all 3 are excellent in my opinion, but AC2 takes the medal for the best mechanics. In AC2, you could swing your camera about during the hopping-op animations to prepare for a swift change in direction when free-running. selecting and aiming for targets was also pretty easy. There were also several locations and maps. In AC: Brotherhood, there is only Rome for the location. And although huge, it got boring. Brotherhood was a shorter game, too, but introduced Multiplayer, which for me made up for it. But back to my two mechanical gripes: the hopping-up animations were HORRIBLE in Brotherhood. You have to wait for Ezio to complete the animation before you could swing the camera around. Fighting and counter-attacks were changed to be a little easier, BUT you were also attacked by MANY more guards at a time. Aiming was still the same as AC2, though -- no complaints there. Revelations is kind of a mess compared to AC2 and Brotherhood. It is VERY difficult to aim and to select a single target. You also have to be significantly closer to the target. More enemies have firearms, too. The hookblade introduces a new way to charge and flip an opponent which is awesome and effective on rooftops and on rifle attackers, BUT they changed the key bindings for hiring a faction group! now, almost everything is done with the empty hand button. the head button is gone, and instead of holding the old head button to activate eagle vision, it is a one-tap button for \""eagle Sense\"" which is actually more dynamic than Eagle Vision. It's like Eagle Vision 2.0. So anyhow, re: the key binding change, don't be surprised if you hire a faction in the middle of a fight instead of flipping an opponent. Annoying. The hop-up animationsare returned to the AC2 settings so you can make some pretty sharp turns while free running, BUT sometimes you get crazy camera rolls and weird angle views that will accidentally send you off a rooftop. The bombs are neat addition, but tricky to master. Multiplayer in Revelations is also MUCH more challenging. you have to be WAY closer to your target than in Brotherhood's Multiplayer. But it is also WAY easier to stun a pursuer in Revelations than in Brotherhood, so it kind of evens the playing field. Less characters to choose form in Revelations Multiplayer, but more customization options -- again, kind of a trade off that balances things out. More game modes. Team games are also generated for you so you're not stuck in a lowbie group being attacked by a pack of lvl 50 bullies. Also, with the Prestige system, there is now a REASON to continue to play once you hit lvl 50. You can hit lvl 50 a total of 100 times (lvl 50 the first time conventionally, then a full leveling from 1-50 = 1 prestige point, of which there are 99). So this means the super competitive lvl 50 players aren't just spamming the lowbies; they are actually still gaining XP, which is cool, cuz everyone has the same chances to do that. All in all, AC2 was probably the smoothest gameplay experience, and most fulfilling storyline. Brotherhood and Revelations are definitely worth playing, but wait for them to go on sale. only a diehard fan needs to pay full price for them. You can get Brotherhood now for like $15-$20.",2012-01-11,617,extra_long,2012-01,games

The interface is very simple for a city-builder, like Minecraft.  The entire planet is a complete wasteland, but can be rebuilt by purchasing materials from a simple point-and-click interface using gold coins, the game's resource.  More gold coins can be found by killing slugs, catmen, or thugs.  The number of materials number in the dozens, however almost all of these is the same material but rotated 90 degrees.  The game is 8-bit, but somehow manages 3-dimensions of building, which gives a lot to the imagination.  For example, brown blocks look nice as a house floor, but when stacked on top of each other it looks like a tree trunk.  Green blocks make nice grass, but in in the air green blocks looks like tree leaves.  Stone blocks in a cube form four walls in a house, but there can be crenellations for a castle's roof.  There's limited art possibilities possible for cacti and smiley faces, and no doubt can be fun for someone with an imagination.<br /><br />There's a lot of ingenuity in this game.  For the halloween update, everyone gets the ability to purchase a pumpkin block.  The fact that the player has to painstakingly farming gold from monsters prevents players from building too quickly, meaning that there's always plenty of wide open land in order to create a whole town.  Town stones, which are required for being a mayor, must be purchased with real money.<br /><br />The cost: Teleport portals must be purchased with real money.  Town banks must be purchased with real money.  Which means that aren't many mayors, and there aren't ghost towns of people whose population is exactly one mayor (here's looking at you, Minecraft.)  Mayors are not gods but simply have the ability to let others share land and housing easily.  I'd like to see one someday.  The total cost of creating a whole town with teleport portals is ten bucks.<br /><br />What bugs me is the amount of content.  There's almost nothing.  There are three pieces of furniture for the house, and a very limited number of customization options for the character.  The game's pizzaz ends a few hours in.  It would probably be a blast if there were six to eight people working on the same town all at once, at the same hour, but then the game would be over eight times faster.

There's an especially disgusting depiction of a clandestine Catholic priest beating a Protestant nobleman to death, and many more false ahistorical distortions await unsuspecting Catholic viewers of this film.<br /><br />Allow me to bring these unfortunate viewers back from this imaginary world and into reality once again. In Elizabethan England, Catholics were so feared that they were subjected to the cruelest executions imaginable. Catholics were hung, disemboweled, and castrated (all in the same execution) while they were still alive. Then they were made to watch as their bowels and innards were burned before their eyes, all at Queen Elizabeth's ordering. Even the Nazis and the Tojos (Japanese Imperials) seldom tortured their victims in so horrible a manner (God rest their souls). In Elizabethan England, this was standard fare.<br /><br />Similarly Ireland and the Catholic Church therein were utterly raped as Protestant Elizabethan purges attempted to eliminate the predominating Catholic gentry, as well as Catholic clergy. There are hundreds of English and Irish Catholic martyrs from this period of history.<br /><br />The atrocities committed by Mary Tudor paled in comparison. It's one thing to tell an honest, impartial story about a controversial historical figure, such as Queen Elizabeth, but it's quite another to lionize this figure, gloss over the atrocities she committed, and portray the innocent victims (eg Catholic priests) of her persecutions as the original aggressors (isn't that how the Axis regimes protrayed their victims?). That alone makes this film propaganda. It's like making a film extolling the scientific achievements of Hitler and the Third Reich and not mentioning the Holocaust.<br /><br />Contrast the reign of Elizabeth with her father, King Henry VIII. Elizabeth and Henry were the early-modern forebears of twentieth century dictators like Hitler. They were both paranoid tyrants who tortured and persecuted religious minorities such as Catholics (St. Thomas More is a very famous Catholic martyr of Henry VIII, and ironically, a member of his court), as well as their political opponents, and yet I've NEVER seen a single positive film portrayal of Henry VIII. What's worse however, is that our modern disgust with Henry VIII is usually generated by little more than a visceral, modern (though completely justified) distaste with violence committed against women, that is, his execution of his wives. As far as Henry's other crimes, we're all historically ignorant and it seems we couldn't care less. Elizabeth carried her father's torch, and continued his bloody work, to an even greater degree.<br /><br />Elizabeth presided over England at an historic time, there's no doubt about it, but, in view of the atrocities she committed, she can never be accorded this level of honor and praise for the same reason other tyrants like Ivan the Terrible and Vlad the Impaler (or in the modern era, Hitler or Stalin) still merit our disgust despite their status as world-changing historical figures.

Its a heavy hitting, highly mobile, but only medium armored melee DPS class.  Do not try and tank, or even get in the line of fire with a Slayer.  You will take big damage.  You have an evade on a small cooldown that lets you get out of the way of harm easily enough though so that is OK.  Its a burst DPS class, where you charge your mp to use your advanced abilites.  Build plenty so you can chain them together for a nice chunk of damage.  Rinse, repeat, and go to town.  This does change up when in an instance as you do have to focus more on staying out of the danger zone of being hit.  I stayed in the middle of a group of enemies just a little to long yesterday after using my abilities and died pretty quick.  A fun, fluid, big DPS class to play IMO.<br /><br />The priest.  I was a little hesitant about starting a priest up just because of how combat might work.  Turns out it is quite fun, you get plenty of offensive skills, and while killing things takes a little longer then the Slayer, is very very viable for solo questing.  BAMs might be tough to solo, but Ill talk about those later.  I havent gone and healed any groups or other people with it yet, so I cannot comment there.  Again combat here is very fluid and fun.<br /><br />The Warrior.  I wish I had started with warrior instead of Slayer.  Just a blast to play as.  Plenty of big skills.  Damage skills that when in use reduce damage you take and an evade/aoe combo make this class a joy to solo with.<br /><br />Cant comment on priest and warrior more then that as I just dont have the play time on them to be able to do so.<br /><br />Found a guild quick enough.  Some good people.  Seems like lots of people have come from Final Fantasy 11 to play.'<br /><br />BAMs are hard, cruel, long fights.  Lots of fun, but require immense concentration and effort, but EXP payout and loot drops are massively increased as well.<br /><br />Instances.  Only played two as Slayer so far, but tons and tons of fun.  The fights are very dynamic.  You cant just sit and do your abilites then move to x, do abilites, move to y, and repeat.  So nice to have a system that player skill matters more then where you stand.<br /><br />Graphics - Damn this game is good looking.  Environments are gorgeous. 5/5<br />Story - I havent been paying that much attention to the story as Ive been having fun with the combat.  Seems solid but not great.  3/5 (so far).<br />Sound - Other then mounts are a little too vocal for me, beautiful.  4/5<br />Combat - Every class is unique and fun (so far). 5/5<br /><br />Loving this game.  Fully recommend it to anyone looking for a unique playing experience that is tired of same ole same ole MMOs.  I loved FFXI, love SWTOR as well.  Never been a big WoW fan.  Loved the zone events in GW2Beta/RIFT (not so much the combat, but just being like, \""Hey, whats going on over there?\"" and proceeding to plow over an event with a bunch of other people).<br /><br />SWTOR story quality, GW2/RIFT zone events, and TERAs combat system would truly be a perfect game for me.  Till then, Ill be on TERA and SWTOR for their respective strengths.",2012-05-07,651,extra_long,2012-05,games

However, the truth of the matter is that most people are susceptible to reading these myths and believing them to the point that they, in their aggregate and complete ignorance, are doing a great deal of harm to our country.<br /><br />This is not a Left or Right issue; the ignorance knows no bounds.  It is mostly about the \""fallacy of composition\"" - that what makes sense for an individual, household, business or even local or state governments makes sense at the federal government level; it's just a matter of scaling up momma's wisdom to the big bad government.  Very few actually give much thought about the difference between those other entities and the federal government - all the former are currency users, only the federal government is the currency issuer.<br /><br /> The federal govt has a monopoly on issuing money; you try to issue the currency, you are going to go to jail for a very long time.  At best (or perhaps worse), people grasp that the federal government can \""print money\"" (actually, the vast majority of money is just electronic keystrokes that credit/debit bank accounts held on computers) but because they don't really understand it, they become scared and end with the conclusion that it is evil and must be replaced by everyone carrying around sacks of gold, silver, potatoes, cows, or brides to barter exchanges.<br /><br />Let's start with this -  You think your fiat money is worthless?  Well, try paying your taxes in anything but it.  Try doing it with your gold, silver, potatoes, cows or brides.  After the IRS has grown tired and no longer amused by your attempts (it doesn't take long), they are going to throw you into either the funny farm or jail.  Then they'll take your gold, potatoes, etc, sell it on the market to get the fiat currency to pay your taxes with penalties; you'll likely stay in the funny farm or jail for a little longer.  That's what the full faith backing of the currency means - the potential to bring the whole govt down on your head like a sledgehammer.... and you thought gold had power.<br /><br /> If you're still not convinced of your fiat money's worth, please comment here and include your e-mail.  I will contact you with instructions on how to send all your worthless fiat money to me.  I'll also certainly take any of your 'worthless' US Treasuries you have lying around.  Heck, I'll even pay the postage!<br /><br />There's so much baloney in Amber's book it would take another book to refute it all - it's not difficult, it just that it's piled so high and deep.  I suggest those who are not brain dead and open to learning how things actually work in a modern economy to do a quick Internet search and get to Warren Mosler or Cullen Roche websites where free primers are available.  Or, try Rodger Malcolm Mitchell's website and his book, \""Free Money.\""  There's also Frank N. Newman's new book, \""Six Myths that Hold Back America.\""<br /><br />If you really believe what Amber Pawlik dishes out in her book, you are doing not only a great disservice to yourself but to your country.

A must see for parents and teenage children!","Before I rent a movie on Amazon, I always start by reading the negative reviews first to find out whether the movie will be worth my while or not.  Some of the 1 star reviews of this movie say that they are mad because the girl is stupid and she almost asked for it, or the movie's end is not satisfying because justice is not served.  Judging by my grown-up stories I immediately knew that this movie might be it!  It might be realistic instead of artificially dramatic.<br /><br />Watching the movie only confirmed my thoughts.  It is realistic in several ways:<br /><br />(1) Young girls are the subject of sexual fantasy, and the social media does not help (like in the movie, 12-16 year old models are often used to convey sexual messages in the fashion world).  You will be surprised to see how many young girls have been improperly contacted by guys of all ages.  When I was a teenager, I have received numerous invites, suggestions, and attempts by guys in their 30s and 40s, either online or in real.  They are stealthy, and leave no trace, once they see the room for advance they will take it, and once they are firmly objected they try to make it look like you have misunderstood them.<br /><br />(2)Teenagers, including virgin girls, have sexual desires.  In a frightening way, little girls may derive excitement from guys' attention and attempts, and some of them give in.  When I was a teenager, I was scared, confused but sometimes aroused when guys tried to make a move on me.  I resisted the temptation but many didn't.<br /><br />(3) When we were younger, many of us were indeed foolish, as many of us care too much about others than our own safety, that the illusion of love trumps good judgment and reasoning.<br /><br />(4)  A girl can be addicted to someone that listens to her, flatters her and seems to be caring and pretends to understand her instead of criticizing her.  She would believe that was real love.  We all have seen a few young girls who have crush on older guysfor the same reason.  Many of these stories causes no harm to anyone, but  if the older guy takes advantage of girl's foolish crush, the story would be different.<br /><br />(5) It is difficult to make someone admit that she or him is wrong, was stupid and made a bad judgment.  It is more difficult to make a rebelling teenager to admit that she's been a fool, it can be extremely difficult to make someone who has just been victimized to realize that she caused her own tragedy.  When the girl started talking back at her parents in the movie, my husband said to me that our kids would never talk to us like that, and I disagreed.  It's part of human nature.  People who grow out if it at young age are rare.  It creates a challenge for all parents who want to prevent their kids from doing stupid things.<br /><br />In sum.  I say this movie is great and is a must see for parents.  I makes me revisit my earlier age and think hard about how to deal with similar situations given that a lot of dangerous situation for young girls are due to the our own human nature.  We have to understand it to address it, and denying it won't help.",2012-08-06,572,extra_long,2012-08,videos
US,52539447,R3EUQ9GDGCMRP4,B009H6LFIY,404912957,Rostta Stone,Digital_Software,1,9,14,False,False,Test other options before spending big $$$ on Rosetta Stone,"There are many different ideas on the best way for adults to learn a foreign language. Much depends on the student, their goals, and their self-discipline. Dealing with a tonal language or a language with a different script, the student need make some big decisions about how they want to learn, and how much. Relatively speaking, Filipino/Pilipino/Tagalog is easy.<br /><br />I learned Spanish as an adult. I am now fluent at a professional/business level. About 10-15% of Tagalog is Spanish, and the spelling of Tagalog words are all based on Spanish sounds.<br /><br />I learned to read Thai. I can write some, but my vocabulary is very small. 90% of my Thai came from taking private one-on-one classes while living in Thailand for 6 months.<br /><br />I studied some Tagalog, some Korean, and some Thai using Rosetta Stone.<br /><br />If you just want to learn some Tagalog to get around as a tourist, enough people speak excellent English in the Philippines you will probably never be able to use it. The Filipinos who don't speak English will typically avoid speaking to you, even when you try to speak Tagalog. Regardless, an immersion product, like Rosetta Stone, is probably not as useful because much of the vocabulary and context is not related to what you will want to know (do you really need to say the boy is under the soccer ball?).<br /><br />If you want to seriously learn the language to be able to carry on casual or business conversations, commit early and realize there is far more work involved. To really practice Tagalog, you will need to go to less savory parts of Manila, or plan on getting outside of Manila, Cebu, away from the red light districts in Olongapo and Angeles, and avoid the resort areas like Puerta Galera and Boracay. To really use Tagalog, you need to go to areas where those who don't speak English are willing to make an effort to understand you.<br /><br /> For me, I first needed to learn the alphabet. Since spelling is based on Spanish phonetics and the Roman alphabet, this was easy for me with Tagalog. For other languages, like Thai, you CANNOT consistently pronounce Thai correctly using Romanized phonetics. T one rules are only consistent in Thai script.  Among other challenges, the Romanization is wildly inconsistent. You learn it one way, and then another source using different phonetics mires you in confusion. The same is probably also true of Korean, as it is also a phonetic language. Learning Chinese will likely be different. This part of Tagalog is easy though.<br /><br />Second, I realized for me, I need to take notes. As adults we want to take notes to help remember key points. If you take the notes in English, you are handicapping yourself. This is more difficult, and far more important, in languages with their own script.<br /><br />Third, again for me, I knew learning translation would create a permanent handicap. Early on, translation is easier, later on translation must be unlearned as it stilts actual conversation and thinking. You just can't translate fast enough. Even now, being fluent in Spanish, translating gives me a headache and frustrates me. I either have a conversation in Spanish, thinking in Spanish, or I have a conversation in English thinking in English. If I know a word in one language and not the other, my whole train of thought is derailed. Avoiding learning translation is where Rosetta Stone shines.<br /><br />I like the idea of Rosetta Stone. If you are disciplined enough to do the lessons regularly, you will expand your spoken vocabulary rapidly. You will remember what you learn. For reading and writing, Rosetta Stone is limited. I doubt it will do much for reading and writing with non-Roman scripts. Like any learning tool, disciplined study will yield results.<br /><br />Rosetta Stone is very expensive. Competing products like L-Lingo or products using different methods like Pimsleur, TellMeMore.com, Assimil, or Fluenz (supposedly the best, but only in a few languages) are a fraction of the cost of Rosetta Stone. Many of the different methods will work better for some people than others. Assimil is translation based. Pimsleur is hard to describe, but has a very good fluency success rate (supposedly). Look up Fluenz also, as the method and reviews suggest it is very effective in the few languages they offer.<br /><br />Besides cost, what is the other drawback to Rosetta Stone? The drawbacks are legion.<br /><br />Version 2 is good. Version 2 is how Rosetta Stone grew into a powerhouse. The voice recognition is very primitive. Version 3 is a refinement of version 2 with improved continuity, a smoother interface, better quizzes, and the ability to get rid of the stupid \""must have CD with you at all times\"" limitation. You can also advance or return to the exact spot where you left off earlier.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Rosetta Stone dropped support for Version 2. Even though they were selling version 2 from their own website in 2012, they dropped support. Mac users are especially impacted as Mac OSX Lion will no longer run PPC apps, and Rosetta Stone never ported Version 2 to Intel. So, if you bought Version 2 in 2012 to use on a Mac, you were ripped off by Rosetta Stone. Join the crowd.<br /><br />Windows users should not be too smug about the situation, as the end of Version 2 support means your product will have all sorts of issues too, unless you downgrade to WinXP.<br /><br />Version 3 runs on current platforms, and is supported (to the extent Rosetta Stone supports any product). Version 3 is easily the pinnacle of the Rosetta Stone application. Given so many users prefer version 3 to version 4 though, don't be surprised if they pull a Microsoft and force users to their new product nobody wants.<br /><br />Total 4e, is a disappointing retrograde of Rosetta Stone. To be fair, if you are always connected -- literally 100% of the time, never a lost packet -- and live your life via social media, Total 4e might work for you. Don't expect to use the highly touted iOS apps on your iPhone or iPad though unless you are connected 100% of the time with those devices also. The whole idea of quickly practicing while in line or waiting in an office...yeah, that doesn't conform to the Rosetta Stone licensing model.<br /><br />Speaking of which, Rosetta Stone now has two components and two licensing models. There is the software application and the online social media part. The application can be run as long as they support it on current platforms. The online social media component is now on a subscription basis. You pay for every month in which you want to participate. You can still use the app on your computer, but you just paid a premium for online access you aren't using unless you continue to pay the subscription.<br /><br />Given there are many free or lower cost websites where learners can interact and practice language skills, why pay Rosetta Stone a monthly premium for less content? Therein lies the reason so many people look at Total 4e and then try to find version 3 before supplies run out.<br /><br />How about another suggestion?<br /><br />Try L-Lingo. L-Lingo uses a very similar learning model to Rosetta Stone. The interface actually has more features than Rosetta Stone and you can customize the interface to use Roman phonetics or native script. They have iPad and iPhone/IPod Touch iOS apps which you can use on a plane, or anywhere else, with or without Internet access. Best of all, all of their programs together (Win or Mac desktop, iPad, iPhone/iPod Touch) are less than half the cost of Rosetta Stone Level I.<br /><br />L-Lingo specializes in Asian languages. They are probably a superior option to Rosetta Stone Total 4e for most users. L-Lingo offers a free trial for their desktop application, and also for their iOS applicastions for some languages.<br /><br />There are other good options listed above, particularly Fluenz and Pimsleur which use different methods.

However, in two days I had beaten the game.  I decided to purchase Radnet DLC, which claims an impressive \""55 DLC packs.\""<br /><br />For all the hype, I was disappointed in my purchase.  Those \""55 DLC packs\"" are mostly challenges and timed events.  Goals such as how far can you toss a human/infected, or how many enemies can you kill in a certain amount of time.  In Prototype 1, these challenges were included in the game at no extra cost.<br /><br />By completing a set of challenges in Prototype 2, a player may unlock more powers.  They are as follows:<br /><br />Fast Learner: Get 25% more EP for kills<br /><br />Health Pack: Brawler Pack has 25% more health<br /><br />Ravenous: Enemies require 10% less damage to consume<br /><br />Security Blanket: Regenerate 1% health per second while blocking<br /><br />Weightless: Float higher after triggering a second Glide mid-flight<br /><br />Fast Learner's exp boost is unnecessary, since I maxed my character out before the second playthrough was complete.  Only the security blanket and weightless are usable on the final boss battle, and neither are necessary.<br /><br />People who enjoy challenges may find the DLC worthwhile.  I wanted more story-driven content, and this DLC does not provide what I really wanted; more missions, characters to interact with, etc.  In my opinion, the challenges detracted from the experience, by reminding me this is a game instead of an interactive story.  When I'm going on a mission to save my character's loved ones from danger, it kills the mood to see a new high score pop up for performing some random act.<br /><br />Since Prototype 1 provided most of this content for free, I did not consider this DLC worthwhile.

Originally scheduled to be released in the fourth quarter of 2011, the album was delayed, Ann was involved in the whole process of re-recording and re-mixing the songs, and as he has stated in several interviews, he kept re-mixing them until he was satisfied with the final result (as a collateral damage, certain songs that were going to be included were removed)<br /><br />The album arrives with the promise of being a re-invention of Ann's 25 best songs from his solo discography with collaborations from friends in certain songs. In his own words, \""a breaking point for his past from his future\"". Then again, in a very strange interview for 'El giradiscos' he claims there was no selection criteria for the tracks and goes even further by saying if he had to do the album again he would probably select different songs. Additionally, he always made it clear that the album would have collaborations but not necessarily duets. The 'Flashback' EP released last year gave us a glimpse of what he meant and after listening to the whole album it is clear why he was being so cautious.<br /><br />The album opens with 'Vamonos al mar', with the collaboration of Mariona Aupi, whose beautiful voice gives a new spin to this song. Two things you will immediately notice, the musical arrangements sound almost the same as the original version, there are slight differences but nothing more(even though the songs were re-recorded or re-mixed); and Mariona, as a guest, sings only a brief part of the song as well as the chorus. This is the same formula you can expect to be repeated throughout the album, which is in my opinion, a disappointment as the idea of having guests so varied and talented offered more potential than this.<br /><br />14 songs in the album do not have any guests collaborating. My suggestion would be to approach this album as a 'greatest hits' without expecting too much like I did. The re-recording and re-mixing that were mentioned while promoting this before its release are... well, not very noticeable. Songs that would fit into this category are: Chica underground, La mejor de tus sonrisas, Dime, Dia Especial (a personal favorite of mine), Maldito viernes,Tus besos son dulces, Mucha suerte, Volare hacia las estrellas, El verano se acabo, Cinco semanas, Vudu, Ateo and El tiempo paso solito (with Juan Carlos Allende on the guitar). As an added value, a new song called 'Tres amores' is included, it follows the same line of electronica with which Ann has experimented before.<br /><br />'Hada', as a colaboration, is a letdown. Originally sung together by Ann and Bunbury back in 2004-2005 during the Freak Show tour, their version was never officially released until now. The arrangement is nothing like the one from the tour (performed by none other than 'El Huracan Ambulante') but exactly the same as the one included in 'Descarado' (2004) with the only difference that the second part of the song is performed by Enrique. Oh yeah, he also does sings the chorus at the end.<br /><br />'Si tu quieres mi princesa', is again, the same version as the one originally released but somehow enhanced by some Roxy Music-style guitars by Phil Manzanera.<br /><br />'Rusa-Rumana' is another one of those that sound exactly like the original. Shuarma, another Bushido,  does the best he can with the small paragraph he was given in the song. The opening lines originally sung by Shuarma are now replaced by Ann, which may startle some fans of the original as it sounds quite different. 'El pozo del lamento' would be the first surprise in the album, the lyrics and the music sound as if they were written with the voice of Nacho Vegas in mind. The result is quite good and way better than other collaborations in the album. Javier Corcobado is another one of the lucky collaborators, the song in which he partakes, 'El desierto' could be included in one of his albums and you would not be able to tell the difference.<br /><br />'Inventare' counts among its collaborators with J. Balaguero (REC, REC 2), Paco Plaza (REC, REC 2) and A. Lesan (all of them Spanish movie directors). This new song is the result of a random meeting they had where they decided to write a song and sing it. Ann liked the result so much that he decided to include it in this compilation.<br /><br />'Cuando saliste de la carcel' featuring Loquillo, another average song, with a theme that sounds quite appropriate for Loquillo. For 'El tejado'  Ann invited San Pascualito Rey, you pretty much know they're there because the booklet says so. 'Bala perdida' would be another song I would highlight from this album, the arrangement is slightly different from the original (not THAT different though) but Adanowky owns the song as soon as he starts citing his part, a great moment of the album. The final collaboration in this double album is from the fourth and final Bushido, 'Reir en la oscuridad' features Morti.<br /><br />As a greatest hits album, this works as is. Those on the fence about getting this or not, I would say if you're a fan, this is a must. If you are looking into getting this album just for the collaborations, it may be better and cheaper to buy the tracks you want separately. I guess the main gripe I have with this album is that it had so much potential and promised so much, yet it failed to deliver, that is of course, just my opinion.e partakes, 'El desierto' could be included in one of his albums and you would not be able to tell the difference.<br /><br />'Inventare' counts among its collaborators with J.

'Bala perdida' would be another song I would highlight from this album, the arrangement is slightly different from the original (not THAT different though) but Adanowky owns the song as soon as he starts citing his part, a great moment of the album. The final collaboration in this double album is from the fourth and final Bushido, 'Reir en la oscuridad' features Morti.<br /><br />As a greatest hits album, this works as is. Those on the fence about getting this or not, I would say if you're a fan, this is a must. If you are looking into getting this album just for the collaborations, it may be better and cheaper to buy the tracks you want separately. I guess the main gripe I have with this album is that it had so much potential and promised so much, yet it failed to deliver, that is of course, just my opinion.",2012-06-06,1226,extra_long,2012-06,music

Some of her choices lead her father to wonder what has gotten into her and her stepmother, wanting to get her out of the house, convinces Daddy that the best solution is to send Snow away to camp. The camp is not the type of place you want to go for the summer, its a discipline camp meant to deal with troublesome teens. snow makes the best of it, but begin to think she's being watched. A series of events lead Snow to think something bad is happening here, and the legend of what happened summers ago leads her to think she might know who is picking off her fellow campers, one by one.<br /><br />This was one of the movies I should have watched the previews for. By watching it and reading the editorial, I could have seen just how badly the poorly the movie was produced, how badly the lines were going to be delivered, and how cheaply this was made. The editorial breaks the movie down, delivering not only the idea behind it but what is happening at the campground. (not that it is hard to figure out).<br /><br />The acting in the movie was rigid, even from the seasoned pair hired to play the parents. I really thought that it might be better,considering the actors. Eric Roberts and Maureen McCormick did surprise me a little when I saw them here, it was one of the reasons i rented it in the first place, but they did not help as much as i would have hoped. Their acting seemed stiff and a little rigid and, despite some kind of mean stuff from McCormick, I longed for an Evil Step Mother out of another tale. Shanley Caswell, who I recognized from a few TV roles, did alright in the movie but, like the parents, the lines were delivered poorly and the movie just seemed low quality. The role she had was not good, either, and seemed atypical at best. The campers were even worse, with a montage of people that are hard to root for when the horror starts.<br /><br />The idea behind the movie seemed aimed at a PG-13 audience, trying to coast the line and deliver a fairy tale that was retold a different way. I actually liked that part of it, the idea itself, thinking the way the main characters came together and the way the stepmother planned on getting rid of her was interesting. This type of modernization seemed interesting, actually, but the way it was pieced together kind of tattered the creativity. If it would have been less rigid and would have made better choices, it could have been at least decently entertaining.<br /><br />It surprised me to read this cost an estimated 1 million bucks to make because it really did not look like it.

I'm glad I did because it's mainly 1st person except when using cover and I've never been able to master 1st person gaming on the PS3.<br /><br />I'm still early into the game, but so far I'm enjoying the experience. This is a slower paced game to take your time with, which I like. I'm the kind of person that likes to do all the missions right (yes, that includes reloading from mission beginning to get items and secondary goals I missed) so I suspect it will take me 25-30 plus hours to complete. There is a lot of NPC interaction with different conversation choices that will affect certain outcomes of missions and what people say about you or recent mission events on the streets. Definitely reminicent of the Cyber-punk games of the 90's.<br /><br />Gameplay seems more geared toward sneaking, considering the 3rd person 'cover' mode allowing you to press against obstacles and walls and peer around corners to see what the enemy is doing. This mode also allows you to round corners or cross open gaps between obstacles with the press of a button. One notable action that seems to be missing here is the ability to vault over objects. It would be nice if, while in 'cover' mode, you could vaut over an object. Instead, you have to get out of 3rd person mode (now you are staring straight at the obtacle you are hiding behind), stand up (if you were ducking) and jump over the obstacle. I'd like to be able to hit a button while in the cover mode so I can see where the enemy is while I'm making my move. Not a deal breaker, but it slows down gameplay a bit more than needed.<br /><br />Another thing I don't like is that displayed mission goal indicators (x)'s on your hud are on regardless if they are \""active\"" or \""inactive\"". Green are secondary missions and green are secondary missions.<br /><br />This is not a FPS shooter by any stretch.

I put in a support helpdesk ticket at Arenanet and they said that the code is not valid...I called Amazon technical support and they said the issue is with Arenanet and NCSoft - that this is a known issue...to make matters worse, Amazon said they WOULD give me a new code, but then got back on the line and said that they do not have any more and are not going to replensish their stock as this was a limited sale item.  They suggested I wait until Monday to see if the issue magically resolves itself...The whole reason for buying this was to play the early access...I spent $59.99 for this and I feel like it was wasted money, since niether side is willing to do anything to get my game code to work.  This is very frustrating.

The dynamic events are perhaps the most blatant spin Arenanet has been promoting the game with. There is nothing dynamic about them; they are still your traditional kill x & get y just that you might not get to complete all the quests in the chain depending on the level of public participation. But essentially all the quests are exactly the same and you will get to see that if you will level multiple characters. The personal story-line is not more than 10% of the game and doesn't feel epic and didn't really drew me in either.<br /><br />2) PVP just doesn't have the hold or spice to keep me playing. Everyone is the same faction, well you get different server duking it out but again there are no factions in the game which doesn't immerse me at all in the feeling that they are two distinct sides at war. The three battlegrounds are small, confined and become very repetitive after a while. And here again the lack of two distinct faction just wrecks the feeling of two sides at war. In one game a opposing player has you pissed off and you want to get at him/her only to have that player as your team-member in the next game.<br /><br />Anyways if I can go back in time I will prevent myself from buying this game and save my $60. Maybe my review might save someone else from buying into the hype and ending up regretting the purchase later.<br /><br />*************************************************************************************************<br /><br />Guild Wars 2 is the next evolution in mmo's. It combines the mechanics of a single player rpg with the online gameplay expectations of a mmo and executes it all well. Thus what you get is a story driven mmo without the story-less grind associated with the usual mmo fare of kill x, get y and deliver z. Other than some minor (to me) features missing from a traditional pay-to-play mmo's you get all what you expect from a AAA mmo; personal story-line, huge persistent world, massive scale pvp, battle-ground style pvp, well thought-out and varied classes, huge capital cities, auction house, crafting, dungeons etc.  All of this with the pay-once subscription free model makes this game a no-brainer purchase.<br /><br />PRO's:<br />1) The game rewards exploration which is how you level in the game basically. Instead of a traditional go to a city and talk to npc's with marks over their heads for your quests; you just explore your zone, and points of interest which are indicated on your map. In your exploration you will stumble upon many random events happening which you can join in with others or solo and complete the objectives. That was your quest right there along with the XP and your rewards given to you right there in a email so no more running back to a hub and turning your quests in. They are dungeons to do too however I haven't worked on any of them yet.<br /><br />2) The world is huge, the zones varied, the landscape nicely detailed which helps the zones feel living and breathing. The capital cities are HUGE in scale. To this date I haven't seen all of most cities especially the human capital city Divinity Reach.<br /><br />3) Finally balanced pvp. In structured pvp  everyone is automatically levelled to max level with all the skills, traits and similar armor. So pretty much it is a battle of skill and strategy not who has the best gear or higher level. As a result the fights last for a long-time even in a group situation and there is no two-shotting in the game. Also no class has permanent stealth which means you don't have to worry about a invisible player stalking and taking 50% or more of your health with the opener. So one can see Arenanet has gone to great lengthsto make pvp as equitable and fair as possible. The wwvw pvp zones are huge too and are reminiscent to World of warcraft (old-school) Alterac Valley or to some extent Isle of conquest battle-ground but much bigger, massive and persistent in scale. There is always a battle going on between three different servers for supremacy and whichever server excel results in helpful buffs for the population such as XP increase.<br /><br />4)Overflow server solution for high number of logins (meaning a seamlessly parallel temporary server) is an excellent solution to waiting as number 1567 and watching the counter time down for who knows how long.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1)The one negative I felt with the game is the absence of mounts or taxis to travel between zones. Just magically transporting all over the world kind of breaks the seamless persistent world immersion.<br /><br />2)Only 5 game wide character slots, and somewhat limited bank storage. More slots or storage needs to be purchased.<br /><br />Regardless as a whole GW2 has changed the mmo genre. And I can't tell you how liberated I feel with no monthly subscription model of the game that I can play the game as often or as less I want without forcing myself to play to justify paying a monthly sub. So if you are looking for a fantasy mmo that genuinely feels evolved and different from anything else out there in the market Guild Wars 2 is a logical choice to get.to make pvp as equitable and fair as possible.

As someone married to a Cambodian Holocaust survivor, I found the interviews with other survivors interesting, but the filmmakers' attempts to turn responsibility for the Cambodian Genocide on its head and blame it on American bombing was evidently the motive for the production.  That began a few minutes into the film with footage of Henry Kissinger being picketed at a dinner in London, over-dubbed with claims that US bombing to support the Khmer king resulted in 600,000 dead and the rise of the Khmer Rouge.  Paul Bogdanor refuted this hoax in \""Manufacturing Distortions\"":  \""...They generate this conclusion by a remarkable sleight of hand. First, they give estimates of 500,000-600,000 dead in the civil war (1970-5) (p. 263), more than twice the real figure [9]. Second, they attribute the civil war deaths - all deaths, both military and civilian, on all sides - to American bombing (p. 260), in truth only a minor factor [10]. Third, they reduce the toll of Khmer Rouge atrocities (1975-9) to 750,000-1 million (p. 263), only half of the actual number [11]. Finally, they maintain that the starvation component of this toll \""must be attributed to the conditions left by the US war\"" (p. 263), and not to the Khmer Rouge policy of enslaving the whole population while abolishing medicine and hospitals and rejecting food aid in the midst of a government-created famine. Doubtless unfairly, I am reminded of the techniques of Holocaust deniers, who exaggerate the cost of Allied bombing and then attribute Jewish deaths in the camps to starvation and disease caused by the war against the Nazis [12].\""  If you can get past the politics, it's an okay film.

Tanks are much more vulnerable than they should be. Artillery, even observed and corrected, is so inaccurate you might as well throw rocks at the enemy.

I found many unusual NON BIBICAL TEACHINGS in his sermon.<br />According to Mr. Klein the antichrist is a system not a man. Mr. Klein stated several times it took him eight years of research to come up with who the antiChrist and the two beasts were but, never clearly cited his sources.  He vaguely uses Daniel chapter 8:1-8 and Revelation 13: 11-17  as his proof, but in doing so he contradicts his own words. At times he does not finish his thoughts and once admits he gets confused.<br />Below is Daniel 8:1-8 (Mr. Klein use this as support the antichrist and second beast is a system)<br />I, Daniel, had a vision, after the one that had already appeared to me. 2 In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal. 3 I looked up, and there before me was a ram with two horns, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later. 4 I watched the ram as it charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against it, and none could rescue from its power. It did as it pleased and became great.<br />5 As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground. 6 It came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at it in great rage. 7 I saw it attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering its two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against it; the goat knocked it to the ground and trampled on it, and none could rescue the ram from its power. 8 The goat became very great, but at the height of its power the large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven.<br /><br />If you read on to Daniel 8:20-22 the bible as always explains Daniel 8: 1-8.<br /><br />DANIEL 8:20-22<br />The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia. 21 The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king. 22 The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power.<br /><br />ALL OF THESE WERE MEN WHO WERE KINGS. LARGE HORN BETWEEN ITS EYES IS ALEXANDER THE GREAT.THE LARGE HORN THAT WAS BROKEN OFF REPRESENTS ALEXANDER'S DEATH IN HIS PRIME. THE FOUR KINGDOMS WERE ALEXANDER'S FOUR GENERALS (MEN) WHO EACH BECAME KINGS AFTER DIVIDING UP ALEXANDER'S CONQUERED LAND AMOUNGST THEMSELVES.<br /><br />Revelation 13: 11-17 (Mr. Klein also uses this as support the antichrist and second beast is a system)<br />11 Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon. 12 And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. 13 He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. 14 And he deceives those[e] who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived. 15 He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. 16 He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, 17 and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or[f] the name of the beast, or the number of his name.<br /><br />I have no issue with the fact that we (Mr.Klein and myself) clearly do not see eye to eye on this, as I am sure many will not agree with my view(my source Dan chap 8 & Rev chap 13)I am not a bibical teacher or in anyway been called by our father to teach scripture. This is my view only,but for those who are considering watching this, do so with prayer and bible in hand. 1 John 4:1-3",2012-05-29,812,extra_long,2012-05,videos

Jack & Jill looked like Sandler was scraping the very bottom of the barrel of old SNL skit characters to make into a movie. When seeing the trailer for this movie, I thought Sandler had hit rock bottom and this movie was going to be the nail in the coffin for his cinematic releases in future.<br /><br />How wrong I was! I was going to dismiss this movie and not even bother to check it out, but a friend who doesn't laugh at much at all recommended it saying it was hilarious. So we checked it out, and now I am glad I did not pass on this one. Even tho Sandler's character didn't seem real and fairly badly acted, like a drunken Billy Madison, it was still an enjoyable movie in the end.<br /><br />Sandler plays a has been celebrity who reached fame as a child by impregnating his teacher in the 8th grade? She went to jail, but he became a celebrity... but over the years, he faded out of the spotlight and had now become a broke down slob who owes about forty thousand dollars in back taxes. He goes to what few friends he has left in show business and asks to borrow money, but none will give it to him. He then makes an offer to a producer about earning $50,000 for a reunion show with him and his teacher in prison, who I think is now his wife? But the producer says instead, how about a reunion show with you, your wife and your son.<br /><br />The son left Sandlers character when he was 18 to have nothing to do with him ever again. His son however is getting married soon and Sandler seeks him and his new in-laws out to talk his son into doing the show. However, upon arrival, the son has told his in-laws his parents are dead, so Sandler steps in and pretends to be his sons best friend and makes up ridicules stories about how they met. Now his father is his sons best man, not by the sons choice and you can get the drift of where it goes from there as the son doesn't want anyone to know thatguy is his dad. Then of coarse, the usual Happy Madison plot takes place where Sandler screws up something, and redeems himself by the end.<br /><br />The humor of this movie is not kid humor, a lot of it is adult humor and almost blue in some areas, and that's how I like it! I didn't expect this movie to be this dirty or for that matter, be funny at all, but it was... to me anyway. Sandlers side kick celebrity new comer side kick is Vanilla Ice, and I think there is a few other appearances by people who where big in the 80's early 90's and have since gone into the \""where are they now\"" unemployment line. Ice doesn't mind making fun of himself, so his role was enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />A lot of WTF moments and sick humor, so if you like that, definitely give this movie a rent and see how it sits with you.",2012-10-20,547,extra_long,2012-10,videos

US,39533818,RHEDLEQMDP71J,B004774IPU,151985175,Sid Meier's Civilization V,Digital_Video_Games,2,1,1,False,False,Step Backward,"From the release of the first Civilization to the release of Civ IV I have probably found more enjoyment from the Civilization series than any other gaming software.  In spite of the promise of improved diplomacy and the other 'improvements' I did not anticipate anything earth shattering from this release but figured it would bring some fresh air into the game.  What I found was a major disappointment and a step backwards in the series.  First off, the game disks were not included in the package, the disk included just loads a program that provides access to \""Steam\"" which I believe is a cloud platform.  It is from this platform that you must actually download the actual program.  After download, which takes a couple hours, you must got through \""Steam\"" to play the game.  2K games also decided that it was too costly to actually provide a written guide, only installation instructions are included in the game package.  As for game play, Of all the releases of this game this one is the worst.  Many of the 'improvements' actually detract from the enjoyment of the game.  The map is very busy and it is often difficult to clearly see some of the resources, where rail lines are completed, etc.  If diplomacy has improved I haven't yet experienced it.  There are still very limited choices and in my first game all the AI leaders were friendly to me in beginning of game but midway through became unfriendly and regardless of what I did that never changed all the way to the end.  With a few exceptions, units can not be stacked which does change the game considerably.  It is somewhat cumbersome selecting individual units which, because of the non-stacking, must be spread all over the map.  I have not found any way to assign the population of cities to particular tasks, there may be a way but, unlike in prior versions it is not intuitive.  They have expanded the government types available greatly, but even these are confusing and if changes can be made after adapting a particular policy again, I do not know how to do so.  The research tree has been expanded somewhat which makes it a little more complex but does mean that you obtain advances a little more quickly than in the past.  New military units have been introduced but I don't feel that has had a major effect one way or another.  Overall, This game is a total disappointment. The changes made to the game actually make it less enjoyable than any of the previous releases.  I gave it two stars only because of the enjoyment the series itself has given me over the years, it probably does not even deserve the second star.  It just is not nearly as much fun to play as previous versions.  I consider this to be a complete waste of money and will probably satisfy my future desires to play Civilization by returning to Civ IV.",2012-01-19,496,long,2012-01,games

If he weren't so partisan, this movie would be more relevant today (much like \""Inside Job\"" is still relevant).<br />* Misses an incredible opportunity at helping by encouraging the interviewers, participants, people who have lost family to suicide over debt, etc, to simply say: \""Teach your children about debt and why they need to avoid it.

After playing this game for an hour and a half, I feel that reservation was accurate.<br />I had heard reviews that this game wasn't quite as good as the original series, and had expected as much from the way the other modern games had turned out. Anyway, this went on sale, so I picked it up for about $3, more than fitting considering how much the Genesis games cost back in the day. Well, kinda wish I could get that three bucks back now. I really haven't enjoyed much about this game, but I'll try not to rant too terribly about it.<br /><br />The game attempts to be a homage to Sonic 1, 2, 3, and CD, using aspects of each games' levels in the new level design, often taking quite large familiar areas and a few boss fights as new gameplay. Not that homages are bad in themselves, but some better parts could be used. (Seriously, who actually liked that wall from Zone II, Act II of Sonic 3? Why would they decide to base an entire act off of it in this game?)<br />The look of the game... I'm mixed on. While the levels themselves don't look to bad with the 3D elements, Sonic and all the enemies look terrible. I don't know if there was some sort of setting that got screwed up in the modeling software or what, but Sonic looks like he's got a floodlight shining on his face the entire time, and the enemies look like they were modeled about a decade ago. The shapes aren't bad, but boy, could they use some better textures.<br />The physics... it doesn't even feel like a Sonic game. For instance, once you start moving, Sonic starts at a crawl with a walk animation. (When did he ever walk in the Genesis titles?) Once 'up to speed', I never felt like he was moving very fast, emphasized by the many, many breaks in the fluidity of Sonic's runs. The original game was inspired by the feel of a pinball machine- Sonic would flow through large chunks of the level, with a few platforming sections at a pretty quick clip. Now, the game feels slower than any platform game I've played in the past year, I'd say a good portion due to that terribly slow acceleration. Sonic games should be about speed, and this one completely dropped the ball on that end.<br /><br />I've gotta say, I was extremely disappointed in this game, and I wasn't even expecting much. The physics and level design seemed to work together to see just how frustrated they could make me, and they succeeded, if that was indeed their goal. Not once in the hour and a half I played this game did I think \""man, I'm glad I bought this\""- rather, I thought many a time \""what the heck was that\"", \""who would make that like that\"", and \""screw you, game\"", with a few suppressed desires to punch or throw my monitor. With a combination of this terrible game play, and the fact that I have to restart Steam any time I want to launch this game in order for it to work, I can't say that I'd be able to recommend this game to anybody. So instead, I'll do the opposite:<br />If you enjoyed any of the original Sonic games in the least bit, do yourself a favor, and avoid this game.",2012-11-25,619,extra_long,2012-11,games

During the 2000s, the series had nothing but a big line of clunkers and game collections, with a few exceptions (Sonic Unleashed, Colors, Adventure series, and the handheld games, to name a few). Then, instead of re-releasing the old Sonics again, Sega finally decided to make Sonic 4, a game that was meant to take the series back to its roots? Did it succeed? I'd say so.<br /><br />Sonic 4 may happen to rehash of Sonic 1 & 2 elements, but the level design, leaderboards, music, homing attack and graphics are all-new (At least, to the original series). The basic gameplay holds up pretty well, and there are some really cool gimmicks added into this installment, such as running across a path of cards, riding in a mine cart, having to beat the special stages under time limits (and no jumping during the Special Stages), etc.<br /><br />Of course, there have to be some flaws. First off, since this was built from ground-up, the physics are off and somewhat floaty. Another thing is that it was really easy compared to the previous Sonics. You won't have a hard time being able to collect 100 (or even 200) rings. Lastly, although this is minor, it could have been more fitting for Sega to use the classic design of Sonic for the game.<br /><br />Those flaws aren't to say that the game is bad. The game itself is just as fun as its predecessors. In fact, while it does contain 4 zones compared to the other Sonics' 6+, certain levels themselves are pretty long. I timed it, and the game is actually just as lengthy as the old Sonics, if not longer. It could be a bit steep for a purchase, but it is totally worth it.<br /><br />Overall, people can say it's a rehash, but in my perspective shown above, in which I think about what's beyond that, it's a new fun Sonic game. Just be sure to have the Steam service installed on your computer. Does it have a lot of flaws? Yeah, but they are pretty tolerable.",2012-01-19,360,long,2012-01,games

Oh, I forgot about Breaking Bad, and Dexter. Glad I don't have to choose.<br />I know it is based on a comic book but I have never seen it and couldn't care less if it follows it or not. I think the writing is excellent and if they did fire the original writers the new ones are doing a fine job.<br /><br />I agree with others that at some point they should move on from the farm house to keep things interesting and unpredictable BUT...<br />If I were in that same situation I would be in no hurry to leave the farm house. You have fresh water, a renewable food supply, and relatively few zombies. And when they do occaisionally stumble out of the woods you can see them coming from a mile away since they have to cross an open field to get to the house. I think the only way it would make any sense to leave is if something drastic happened like the house burning down. Even then, the location is still ideal and I think I would either rebuild it or go scavange for more RVs or even find a truck and drag some abandoned mobile homes onto the site. In any case I think the writers need to give them a very compelling reason to leave or it won't make sense.<br /><br />I think Rick is without question the type of person I would want as the leader of the group over someone like Shane. Rick has proven that he can kick A$$ when he needs to (both in this and the previous episode) yet he knows how to be a diplomat when the situation calls for it. Granted there is no room for diplomacy when it comes to the Walkers but there are other groups of survivors out there and the answer will not always be \""Kill 'em all, let God sort it out.\"" but that is the only answer Shane knows. Before the apocolypse they were both cops. Would you rather be pulled over by Rick or Shane? That said, someone like Shane can be very valuable to the group, just not as the leader. I think in this episode Rick did what he needed to do to reestablish himself as the Alpha Male of the group.<br /><br />Shows like this are very expensive to make and unfortunately have a limited audience. There are just a lot of people who you will never convince to watch just because there are \""Zombies\"" in it. I know. I tried. No matter how good the writing and acting is. The same goes for shows about space smugglers with an old west theme, or robots from the future, etc. I love these types of shows. If you are reading this then you probably love these types of shows too, but we are a minority. It is understandable then that the budget for a show like this has to be limited if it is to turn a profit at all. No profit, no show. That's just plain old economics. Legal dramas for example are cheaper to produce and have a potential for a much larger audience. I like those too when they are well done. I recently checked out The Firm 2012 on HULU and liked it.<br />So I am ok with a few compromises if it keeps the show in production. You want an episode with more zombies? Fine. Some of the supporting cast will have to sit out. You want an episode with a lot of involvement from the supporting cast? Ok. We'll have to cut way back on the zombies.<br />I am ok with this give and take to keep a great show going. Maybe for the season finale you say \""To hell with the budget! Bring on the zombies and hand Dale a shotgun!\""<br /><br />I love this show and am very much looking forward to the rest of this season and beyond.

So Jeremy then blasts about where the Prius is made and how much nastiness is in the car - it's a bit ridiculous and stilted a long ways to the way he wants to think.

I now know he isn't worth the price of his works.<br /><br />In the attempts to sound credible there were interviews with people who \""knew\"" Obama. D'Souza might as well have interviewed me, since I know how to spell Obama as well. One can't claim to have any insight one a person they might have might once or have the same last name.<br /><br />Yes, low information voters may flock to this film and even claim it is better than it really is, but only those with low expectations of anything will find it worth seeing more than once. For me, once was too much.<br /><br />I know crap like this has me glad I'm voting Obama/Biden in 2012.",2012-10-22,209,long,2012-10,videos

I enjoy the combination of up-tempo music with the morose or violent lyrics in God Wants Us to Wait, Andrew in Drag and Your Girlfriend's Face. The themes in these three songs are the anguish of love unconsumated, unrequited or gone to violent contentiousness.  Beyond that there are flashes of cleverness in songs such as My Husband's Pied-a-Terre(betrayal), Quick(breakup) Machine in Your Hand(jealousy of a telephone) and Horrible Party(really bad date night) but mostly the other songs fell flat for me. With songs ranging from 2:05 to 2:38 in length they mostly seem too short to tell a good story.<br /><br />Some Merritt fans will like this album but I think it stands up poorly to the Magnetic Fields other work. For most listeners I suggest you explore some of Merritt's extensive back catalog instead such [[ASIN:B00000JY1X 69 Love Songs]],  Merritt's solo release: [[ASIN:B005HG8OHS Obscurities]] or  [[ASIN:5550563398 Charm of the Highway Strip]] all of which I prefer to Love at the Bottom of the Sea.",2012-03-17,237,long,2012-03,music

Just like his look which went from warm, holy Jew to cold, sunglasses over sad eyes, bleach blond corporate \""pop star\"", his music has sadly followed in the same artificial flavor path. Spark Seeker is over-produced laptop created techno pop for people with short attention spans and hands on their cellphones 24 hrs a day. The music has about as much spark and depth as a Michael Jackson album. If you have nothing better to do you might dance a little to it but then you realize that your really not being moved and you flip channels. For some strange reason that seems like either a bad acid trip or some kind of serious case of bi polar disorder, Matis seems to be riding the plastic train of superficiality full speed ahead.<br /><br />To go from a cool sincere Jew, proudly committed to the Jewish faith to a Hollywood type prancing around like a stoned effeminate factory made pop star wearing more scarves than Elton John is about as spiritual as a good Saturday Night Live skit. Its good comedy but certainly not real art or real life(living). There is nothing spiritual going on here except worship of the EGO-that false god that claims the lives and vitality of many good people. The whole \""spiritual journey\"" thing is a total scam as the journey here is all about ME--not Him.<br /><br />Jews don't have spiritual journey's on facebook and twitter and with constant photo shoots celebrating new haircuts. After 3500 years their path to the One above is much, much deeper. They have spiritual journeys when they are true to their Torah and their identity. Everything else is just Hollywood. Matis himself sang this in the song \""Jerusalem\"" --\""Change your name and your identity, don't you know that's not the way to be\"". His fans need to be given a little more credit. Does he really think that they would fall for this sad display of holy Jewish soul that lost its way? No one wants to see the Jews act like everyone else. The world wants the Jews to be role models to teach the great wisdom about life that they have. Those who understand will understand and pray for all the impressionable children soiled by this irresponsible use of popularity and influence.

Sure enough, after the cutoff date, I couldn't download transactions directly from my financial institutions anymore.  I kind of feel like they were holding me hostage, forcing me to pay another $35 or so to keep the convenience of being able to download.  Its kind of a crappy thing to do.  They shouldn't disable features and services that work perfectly fine on software.  The fact of the matter is that Quicken 2012 offers NOTHING for me and the way I use the software that my Quicken 2009 didn't do.  I wouldn't have upgraded otherwise, I wouldn't have needed to.  But here I was, held hostage and I figure in 3 years they'll probably pull the same stunt again.  If they do, I might start to look at what other options are out there because money management software has come a long way since Quicken was the innovator in personal finance software.<br /><br />So I get this thing installed and that was fine but guess what?  None of the financial institution downloads would work.  So the very thing that I bought it for was the very thing that wasn't working.  I contacted customer support, and the guy couldn't figure it out so he had me email logs and such and said someone would get back to me in 7 - 10 business days.  After 3 weeks I still hadn't heard anything so I emailed back twice more.  Finally I got a solution to the problem (turns out it was a very quick and simple fix that the first guy should have been able to address).

STOP!  You MUST listen to this album.  If you are a lover of truly good Metal/Rock with exceptional musicianship then listen to these guys.  I've been listening to rock since I was 10 and I grew up listing to Hendrix, Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and continued to Megadeath, Metallica, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Rammstein, and the list goes on.  Being a guitar player myself I can tell you that the dynamics, articulation, and phrasing of the music is top notch. (Up front I have to apologize if the translations are wrong, but if so blame Google Translate.)<br /><br />Listening to this album you can not deny the Metallica influence and Krisztian Lovrek (vocals/guitar) is up front with \""old school\"" vocals.  Guess what?  He can really sing; unusual given the growling voices of metal bands of today.  Adding to the band are K&aacute;rp&aacute;ti Zolt&aacute;n Zal&aacute;n (guitars/vocals), K&aacute;rolyi Zolt&aacute;n (drums), and Farkas Istv&aacute;n (bass guitar).<br /><br />The album starts with the song \""Akarom\"", or \""I\"" in English, with a hard and driving beat and the guitar solo cuts right through you like a searing hot knife. Passages of the solo remind me of Dave Murry of Iron Maiden, his sweep picking techniques of Steve Vai and Yngwie Malmsteen and the tremolo pinched harmonics of Joe Satriani.  Simply put, WOW!<br /><br />The album drives from the first song to the last. \""El&aacute;slak\"", can't find a translation, changes the mood from Akarom, and in some ways has phrases that reminds me of Alice in Chains but the style is unique and purely Lovreck.  Make no mistake this is no copy band.<br /><br />\""Mennyit b&iacute;rsz?!\"", or \""How Much Can You Stand\"", kicks you right in the chest.  You can't deny the musical influences here.  I almost hear James Hetfield singing \""Hey, Hey, I'm your light..\""  The drums, as in all the songs, continue to push you to the edge.  The fills and rolls add complexity and nuance to the pieces that make this band rich in texture.  The bass complements the drums with force and authority.

Needless to say, I really like this piece.  It starts with drums and bass; very rhythmic almost tribal. Next the guitars come in with single notes waving from a slight bend of the guitars tremolo, just floating in the air.  I can see James Bond and a tall voluptuous model clinging on to Mr. 007.  Next thing you know you're being pulled into metal mayhem and into the vortex of head banging madness.  (It rocks!!!) No speed solos here, just a well composed tune.  They've already proven their mastery of their instruments.<br /><br />\""Tied Volt\"", or \""Yours Was The\"" changes the feel to a more melodic and rhythmic feel then half way through the drums speed up the pace, the guitars return to the intro accentuating the melody with pinched harmonics on the guitar passages (ala Zakk Wylde of Ozzie fame) and the song resumes it's melodic beginning all the way to the finale culminating in a sustained feedback of guitars.<br /><br />If you're a lover of rock/metal that is complex, melodic, rhythmic, interesting, with outstanding composition and vocals then you HAVE to check this band out.

Started with a scanner/Paperport bundle from visioneer back in the late 90' it was basic document management but it was all I could afford as an individual. I upgraded Paperport versions to keep OS and scanner compatibility, but the software got worse and worse with time. Since taken over by Nuance and its V13 of Doom, it became simply unusable - too slow and clumsy.<br /><br />I then definitively gave up trying to do anything with Paperport. Bought a new marvelous scanner, the Fujitsu ScanSnap S1500. Probably one of the best document scanner I ever bought. The bundled software was OK for a while but I needed more: something with good multilingual OCR and taking less time to organize documents.<br /><br />I gave FileCenter 6 a try last year but it was missing features for the price.<br /><br />I'm now using Version 7.1 and this one perfectly meets my needs: One touch scanning, OCR and Indexing.<br /><br />Once everything is nicely configured as you want, which shouldn't take more than an hour, here is the process flow:<br /><br />1. Launch FileCenter<br />2. Select document destination<br />3. Open the lid of the Fujitsu scanner and place the document in the feeder<br />4. Press the scan button<br />5. Done. The document is scanned to PDF, with searchable OCR text, saved in the folder/drawer I want it to, and indexed for easy retrieval.<br /><br />-= No extra steps needed, no popups, dialogs or anything requiring more actions on my end. =-<br /><br />That is how things should be.<br /><br />This great piece of software has a bunch of cool features such as:<br /><br />- Possibility to view documents as LARGE thumbnails. This makes the software usable even on ultra high resolution monitors, they could even be larger...<br />(If you like it tiny, just slide the thumb size cursor).<br />- A floating preview window, which, on dual monitor setups, allows you to see documents full size as you manage them<br />- Possibility to inline rename the documents (even with preview open if you choose the standard previewer)<br />- You can add PDF stamps to your documents to e.g. mark invoices as 'paid' and import your own stamps too.<br />- Stack and Unstack (Append/Prepend) documents. (Even if I don't like the dialog box that pops up) - No need to open the editor to merge items in a single doc.<br />- Extract Pages, Combine PDFs etc.<br />- Password protect sensitive documents<br />- Split View where you can have source/destination and drag-n-drop between them.<br />- The folder template feature and Outlook contacts integration(which I don't use myself) seems to be a really great thing for physicians, dentists or lawyers.<br /><br />The editor is good as well, with most features you find in similar products. But I must say I rarely need to open the editor to perform my daily tasks.<br /><br />The guys at Lucion understood things can be simple AND powerful. I'm looking forward the next releases.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Fantastic time saver<br />- Light on resources<br />- All in one application<br />- Supports Fujitsu ScanSnap<br />- Advanced OCR that supports multi language documents.<br />- Efficient thumbnailing<br />- Very friendly and responsive technical support (Thanks Jeff!)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Sometimes shows dialogs you wouldn't expect or would like to disable with a \""don't show this window again\"" checkbox.<br />- Crashed a couple of times in a month usage. But with no harm as it is an extra layer over the filesystem. No damage to the files or folder structure. Just restart and continue.<br />- After a power outage, I had to reset my settings which I couldn't do on my own - Problem solved with the great help of technical support. Would have liked a settings backup/restore function at that time.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />FileCenter Pro is a great product. I would recommend it to anyone.<br />They offer a Demo version, so give it a try before going forthe more marketed/advertised products. You won't regret it.<br />If you're one of the numerous users fed up with Nuance's \""marketing\"" releases. Just go for it !",2012-05-13,691,extra_long,2012-05,software

Duke and I staring at each other face to face after 12 years of development hell. How did he stand up? For starters the game isn't nearly as bad as everyone is saying. It's just not as good as everyone hoped. The game won't knock you off your feet or make you think differently about FPS games, but it does feel like classic Duke and that's what counts in the end. The story is the same as always: Pigcops and the evil Cycloid Emperor are stealing our chicks to make alien babies. Pretty cheesy? That's the entire point so don't come into this game thinking its just bad ass. The entire game is coated in thick gooey cheese and if you don't like it go away right now.<br /><br />The action is just like classic Duke in the sense that you run around shooting anything that moves with the biggest gun you can find. Its a recall of the heydays of FPS games from the early 90's and it feels good to play one that's actually good. The game even starts out with a slap in the face by having Duke pee in a urinal and you controls the flow. This is Duke for you and if this stuff offends stop playing there because it gets worse as the game goes on. My favorite part about Forever are the interactive objects which add to your Ego which is your health bar. Finding certain things in the game will boost this and there are dozens of them some funny, sexy, or just weird like picking up a turd out of a toilet.<br /><br />Duke is also infamous for his cheesy one liners and they are spewed left and right through the whole game. Things like \""Hail to the King baby!\"", \""How many pork chops can I make out of you?\"", \""Come get some!\"" are just a few. Duke's personality is something you will either love or hate, but its classic and that makes me love it. The game is also infused with a lot of sex such as one whole level that is just a strip club you walk around in called Duke Nukem's Titty City. You have to do a treasure hunt for a stripper for a lap dance that consists of finding popcorn, a vibrator, and a condom. Just walk into the bathroom and Duke can enjoy the glory hole in the stall. Yes its very gratuitous and goes over the top, but that's what's great about this game. Not only this but it sticks it to a lot of pop culture of today such as an EDF soldier asking Duke if he needs power armor (it's Master Chief's armor in the ship) and Duke says \""Power armor is for pussies!\""<br /><br />Of course it all comes down to playing the game and the action is varied with driving sections, and even Duke getting shrunk down which is very fun to do especially when listening to his high pitched voice. A lot of classic Duke weapons are here such as the Devastator (with 69 bullets as a pun), Ripper, and RPG. The guns even look the same which brings back memories. Quick time events were added during boss fights (which are really fun) and during other parts of the game so it has a bit of cinematic juice in it.<br /><br />The worst part about the game? The looks. Sure it uses the Unreal Engine 3 but the level design and overall feel is really dated. Mountains don't have that nice distant real look to them. Instead you can drive right up there side like you're playing Motocross Madness 2 or something. The textures aren't low res but not very detailed like everything just got converted from 2005. The game actually looks that old, but not enough to distract you too much. The physics are wonky like you're playing a Nintendo 64 game, but you can't really blame the game itself.<br /><br />Overall Duke Nukem Forever is a fun game to play. It may not have been worth 12 years for this it still feels good to play as the King again.

The line-up of Animetal USA is made up of Mike Vescera (ex-Yngwie Malmsteen/Loudness) on vocals, Chris Impelitteri (Impelitteri) on guitar, John Dette (ex-Slayer) on drums and the amazing Rudy Sarzo (ex-Quiet Riot/Ozzy Osbourne/M.A.R.S./Whitesnake/Dio/etc.) on bass. It goes without saying that when you put musicians of this caliber together the result is going to be amazing. This album (and group) delifinitely delivers.<br /><br />First off I think it should be said that the version of the album \""Animetal USA\"" is a sort of conglomeration of their first two Japanese albums \""Animetal USA\"" and \""W\"". Both of those albums have eleven songs each. This one thirteen. Most of the songs from here are from the first album. The songs here from \""W\"" are \""Touch\"", \""JAM Project Medley\"" and the Japanese version of \""Give Lee Give Lee Rock Lee\"". It should also be noted that the english version of \""Give Lee Give Lee Rock Lee\"" is exclusive to this release. The songs missing from the album \""Animetal USA\"" (the Japanese version that is) are \""Gatchaman\"" (I have no idea how they could've left that one off.) and \""Kinnikuman Go Fight!\"". So that's basically what you're getting in this special version of this album.<br /><br />Now onto the album itself. If you're not familiar with the idea of Animetal then I'll give a brief rundown of the idea here. Basically Animetal (both original and USA) take various theme songs from anime shows (usually classic ones) and turn them into metal arrangements. The big differences between the original Animetal and Animetal USA are that while the original Animetal released studio albums known as \""Marathons\"" where they performed TV-Sized versions of the songs in rapid succession saving full versions for lives while Animetal USA performs them in long, full form (though they do have a few medleys here and there, but they're more properly medleys not too similar to Animetal's original marathons). Also Animetal USA performs these songs in English, original english too mind you. \""Yuzurenai Negai\"", \""Do You Remember Love?\"", \""Cutie Honey\"" and \""Moonlight Densetsu\"" (All from their second album \""W\"")  among others have had \""official\"" English versions before, but these are all original English versions with English lyrics mainly provided by Mike Vescera. Lastly, the orinal Animetal were known for mixing in classic riffs into their songs both live and in their marathon medleys. Animetal USA continues that tradition. To name but two they integrate the riff from \""The Trooper\"" into \""Ai wo Torimodose\"" and a hell of a lot from \""Crazy Nights\"" (Loudness) into the aforementioned \""Yuzurenai Negai\"".<br /><br />Enough of that, I'll review each song individually now.<br /><br />1. Touch - The album has a very nice start with the theme from the obscure-in-the-US-but-huge-in-Japan anime also named \""Touch\"". I prefer this song over the original Japanese album's opener (\""Spaceship Yamato\"") The track has a great keyboard into then goes into a heavy riff (though very faithful to the original) and lyrics that are a practically perfect translation. The solo from Chris Impelitteri is awesome here and this is probably my favorite song from Animetal USA, though on a side note, I kind of find myself wishing they'd kept the song's original riff here. It truly stands on it's own and can be enjoyed even if you've never seen, or even heard of, the original anime it comes from. Seeing as it's never been released officially in the US (it exists here in fansubs only) I doubt anyone will have any major preconceptions on this song and can simply enjoy it for what it is. An awesome metal track featuring top notch musicians.<br /><br />2. Mazinger Medley (Mazinger-Ore Wa Great Mazinger) - Here is a medley of sorts. We get the full version of \""Mazinger\"" and the TV-Size of \""Ore wa Great Mazinger\"". Mazinger is huge in lots of places though the US isn't one of them. There are lots offans of it of course. Go Nagai is amazing and Mazinger is a classic anime in the giant robot genre, but the original has still not seen a full official US release (I believe there was a TV edited version of \""Great Mazinger\"" in the eighties, but nothing lasting) The songs here as they are presented here and pure fun. Rudy Sarzo and Scott Travis (drummer on the first album) provide strong support to Impelitteri's amazing guitar work throughout. Some of the lyrics are a little wonky in their translations and are sometimes squished into a melody not really meant for English, but overall it works. The \""Great Mazinger\"" section is so powerful I defy anyone to not find themselves at least moving their head along to the music if not outright headbanging!<br /><br />3. Pegasus Fantasy - \""Saint Seiya/Knights of The Zodiac\"" is another anime that is HUGE around the world. The difference is that this one has many official releases (both the anime and manga) and while not huge in the US it is very popular. Animetal's version is a little too straightforward at times, but they still shine through and put in a very solid song. Another amazing solo from Impelitteri and we have a very faithful hard-rocking version of a very well-loved anime theme song. The lyrics are well-done here and the chorus is hard to not sing along with.<br /><br />4. Uchuu Senkan Yamato - The original opener from the Japanese version of this album. This anime is better know in the US as \""Star Blazers\"" and is a favorite in the old school anime crowds. I was never a big fan of the anime, but I knew of it and it's theme. This is an amazing version of the song. The whole bridge of the song is incredible. The rhythm is non-stop driving and the solos shred your speakers to pieces. The lyrics suffer a tad from being forced into an awkward melody at times, but nothing can be done for that. It is a little on the short side though, but it's a very powerful three minutes. Also interesting is that they have an official PVfor this song which features the band and great CG work from the multi-talented Rudy Sarzo.<br /><br />5. Jam Project Medley (Vangaurd-Maxon-Skill) - The JAM Project Medley is amazing. Plain and simple. These songs have more western-friendly melodies and the lyrics don't have the \""squished\"" feel they have in other songs and all three of the songs featured here are amazing. The band is in their best form here. They give these songs their own stamps while being very faithful to the originals. This is the strongest of their medleys in my opinion and another of my favorite songs by them. Only small complaint is that while the medley is amazing, some of these songs could've received full treatment.<br /><br />6. Makafushigi Adventure - The original theme from \""Dragon Ball\"" (original not \""Z\"") the problem here is that EVERY anime fan in America knows what \""Dragon Ball\"" is, but only the hardcore fans know this song. While the anime and all it's sequel/movies have seen release all around the world, localization usually ensures that no one outside of Japan sees/hears some aspects of the original shows. They are edited for content and usually get their themes changed. \""Makafushigi Adventure\"" probably means nothing to an American fan, but the song is still a good one. Not their best in my opinion. It's almost a filler track, but it's not badly executed. Nothing really negative to say except that while the anime is anything but obscure, the song is.<br /><br />7. Zankoku Tenshi no Thesis - Now onto a song that every anime fan worth their salt is familiar with. The original version of this song (Of course featured in \""Neon Genesis Evangelion\"") is a classic plain and simple. Animetal USA takes the amazing song and puts their own stamp on it. Chris Impelitteri has a great intro and the lyrics (squished sadly) are an amazingly accurate translation. Any fan can appreciate this amazing version of the song. That being said, the fact that it is so well-known in the US fan community it'll probably be one of the ones that is criticized the most. I think it's a strong tribute to the Japanese original and one of the strongest songs on the album.<br /><br />8. Ganbare Dokaben -Into The Void- - I've never heard of either the anime or this song before. The song is fun though and while it has some of my previously mentioned issues (lyrics squishing and obscurity) it's a fun song that has some great riffs and rhythm.<br /><br />9. Yuke Tiger Mask - Another unfamiliar song. This one may be very obscure, but it's AMAZING. It has a strong beginning. It slowly builds and has some amazing solos then takes off at the end and becomes a guitar-shredding bass-pounding metal song. The best of both worlds are in this song. Anthem-like beginning to speed-finish. I may not be at all familiar with this song, but that doesn't keep it from becoming one of my favorites.<br /><br />10 - Yuke Yuke Hyuuma - The third of the songs on the songs that I am not at all familiar with from this album. This one has some good metal riffing and guitar shredding and pounding rhythm so all is not lost. Obscure though it is (to an American listener at least) I think it's telling that these songs can still be enjoyed and still be good metal songs on their own even without their attachment to a popular anime.<br /><br />11 - Ai wo Torimodose - Another song that will catch the attention of US fans. The original theme from \""Fist of The North Star\"" was amazing enough. This one ups the metal-ness (and believe you me, there are tons of other metal covers out there) to the tenth degree. The english lyrics are excellent here. My favorite song off their first album by far. I love the slow-down for the bridge, you think you're going to get something super fast, but it goes mid-tempo while still being driving with some amazing shredding. And did I mention the \""Trooper\"" riff? The first time I heard the riff after the first chorus I almost jumped out of my chair! This song is amazing, seriously, I couldgo on forever about all the good points here, but just listen to it for yourselves to see what I mean. My only complain with this song is this. It's a big one too. THE US VERSION OF THIS SONG REMOVED THE TROOPER RIFF!!! I wanted to scream and complain to everyone the first time I heard the US version (I have the CD version sold at Anime Expo. The same version that sold here for download) and there is NO TROOPER RIFF. The song is a tad shorter for it, but worse is you can almost feel the trip-up in the edit after the first chorus where it just jumps into the return riff before the second chorus. I can only assume this was a licensing issue, but I think it's unforgivable. I wonder if the band even knows about this? Probably was just a record company choice.<br /><br />12. Give Lee Give Lee Rock Lee (English Version) - I have not yet seen this Naruto spin-off (There is very little info on it in the US yet) but I really like this song. The Japanese version of the album only featured the Japanese version, but I really like this version. There is no lyric-squishing and the song is very upbeat and fun. A pretty strong departure from the rest of the album really. I'm not a Naruto fan at all, but I really like this song. Then again as I've said before, one of the strengths of this album is you don't need to be a fan to enjoy these songs.<br /><br />13. Give Lee Give Lee Rock Lee (Japanese Single Version) - The Japanese version of the aforementioned song. This version features Hironobu Kageyama on main vocals with lyrics in Japanese. I like this song too, but the English version blows it out of the water in my opinion. No offense to Hironobu Kageyama he does an amazing job here though I think it just....feels better in English. Perhaps if Mike Vescera would've been more present here I would like it more? Not a bad song, but listen to the English one first.<br /><br />All in all a great album. I strongly suggest getting it at this awesome price that Amazon has up you won't regret it. My only real complaint as I said before is with the US version of \""Ai wo Torimodose\"" , but the rest of the album is so amazing I can't try to say that it's not worth buying because of some ridiculous US-Edits. Hell, it's not the first time hard rock/metal songs have different edits when they come to the US. It's almost a tradition in itself. As closing I'd like to mention that I had the great honor to see these guys perform their first US concert live at Anime Expo 2012 and they were AWESOME. I got to shake the hand of my one of my idols, Rudy Sarzo and meet two of my favorite metal musicians ever Mike Vescera and Chris Impelitteri. John Dette was awesome too, but I'd be lying if I said I knew of him before Animetal USA. I got autographs pictures and an amazing experience all said. I strongly suggest that anyone who listens to this album and falls in love with it follow the band and see them at any other expo they attend or any other live they perform in the US! I hope this is a band that stays around for many years to come.",2012-07-22,2316,extra_long,2012-07,music

She can't remember what happened during those moments Joey was alive and she struggles throughout the novel in trying to bring those memories back.<br /><br />Right after Joey's death Maggie tries to remember those missing moments but once she learns that Joey may have been hiding secrets from her, it seems like she then tried to avoid remembering them. However, I can't judge her too harshly since I cannot even imagine going through that kind of trauma and I would want to avoid it myself. Especially once she realizes that the Joey she knew may not have been who he really was. My curiosity was piqued and I wanted to know where Joey had gone after dropping everyone home after the party on Saturday night.<br /><br />One of the things I really enjoyed from the novel were the friendships everyone shared. Maggie, Joey, Adam, Pete, Tanna, and Shannon all grew up together and with Joey's death hanging around them, they tried to be there for one another while also dealing with their own grief. Pete and Tanna were the go-to in trying to make everyone feel better and make them smile. I think Ms. McBride did a wonderful job in weaving their friendships and their histories together. And in also portraying the way teenagers really behave and in creating such unique and well-rounded characters.<br /><br />Once the truth of Joey's secrets came out, I had already figured it out. All the pieces of the puzzles had been connected and I was just waiting on Maggie to catch up and deal with it. I felt betrayed and I would have loved to see how everyone dealt with it. Would they forgive and forget and stay friends? Or would that have been the end of those years of friendship? Would the repercussions be only for that person? Questions and questions and no answers for them.<br /><br />One part that did have me teary eyed was when Maggie was saying her goodbyes to Joey and letting go him in the same place where they had their first date (And it was such a awesome first date). It was such an emotional and important part for Maggie in order for her to move and it was done is such a lovely way.<br /><br />I'll share with you this one quote that I think really sums Maggie's feelings throughout the book:<br /><br />\""What if it's as simple as one moment? One tiny thing, like that kiss on the rocks? What if I'd kissed him a little longer? Would he be alive right now? Or what if I stayed with him Friday night, what if I'd been with him...wherever he was?\""<br /><br />I am not giving this book a 4 star, though I did enjoyed and liked it, because I just wasn't jumping for joy, or bawling my eyes out in this case, and it was low on the swoons. I have to have my swoons.

I stumbled on to them quite by accident, as I saw them in concert with Relient K 3 or 4 years ago. I have grown to love them, the first album that I heard (which was out at the time I saw them) was \""The End is not the End\"".  Obviously a high point in their career, I felt like \""Suburbia\"" was a not quite as strong but still very good.<br /><br />What I have hoped for since \""Suburbia\"" was that they would outgrow their need to produce a \""gimmicky\"" album (probably not the right description, but was the closest that I could come up with). TEINTE has the war theme, Suburbia the dichotomy of our society and rich/poor. I wondered what they could produce if they just put together some good songs with their amazing talent and lyrical skills, but didn't have to worry about stringing together 12 songs that had a similar \""theme\"".<br /><br />I think I got my wish with Cold Hard Want. From beginning to end this album displays HOH at their finest. I have only heard it a couple of times through, but already I think it is my favorite of all their albums to date. A great mix of fast and slow, hard and soft and their lead singers fabulous range. They have really matured as a band. The songs all stand alone as fine pieces in their own rite, and fit together fine but without an overpowering theme that feels like a stretch. You can see other reviews for a song by song breakdown, there are several catchy tunes on this album. They have really refined their style and it shows.<br /><br />I am not a 'fanboy' but I am a fan. For those of you who have seen HOH live or have enjoyed their albums so far, you will not be disappointed. The opening day price on Amazon for 3.99 is an absolute steal.

Crusader Kings 2 is easily one of the deepest strategy games I've ever played. The game covers a 400 year period starting in 1066, and during that time you play a succession of rulers who manage a county or duchy or kingdom or even an empire. You have to balance a stunning number of factors to rule effectively, from keeping your vassals happy to managing your councilors to expanding your realm. Maybe most importantly, you have to build your dynasty -- because once your ruler dies, you start playing your heir, and if you have no heir, it's game over. The number of plates you have to keep spinning is bewildering, and every little factor affects something else so if you want to succeed you can't take shortcuts. The interface of the game is at first very confusing, and unfortunately the tutorials are pretty much useless, so the learning curve is extremely steep, but once you get the hang of things, this game will give you an incredibly satisfying strategy gaming experience.

Good premise but neither of the 1st person characters is very interesting or likable. The environments are alright if extremely limited. The game has a flat 2D matte-painting feel reminiscent of Syberia and other 3rd person POV games, but without the attention to detail or cinematic quality that would help make it more interesting. Each location only has two or three 3rd person views and you'll soon be disappointed by the limited range of movement.<br /><br />The biggest problem is the extremely linear storyline that consists of clicking through all the NPC conversation threads until the next goal is unlocked. There are a lot of \""I don't want to go there,\"" and \""Now what would I do with that?\"" from your character when clicking on hotspots. That's not unusual for Viva games but somehow they are more annoying in this game. Sadly the only challenge in the game is trying to figure out what sequence of steps is required (talk, acquire, examine, talk again, combine, use... repeat) to accomplish the childishly obvious solution to any given problem. This leads to the inevitable, \""I know what I have to do, but what the heck do I have to click on to make it happen!?\"" frustration that pulls you out of the game. For example, after awhile of wandering around aimlessly you'll discover you can Examine (right-click) NPCs even after you have exhausted the conversation thread. In truth it's little more than a walk-through hidden-object game. The last quarter of the game is taken over by cut-scenes and voice-overs (some even have you staring at a completely black screen) that push you along to a few simple locations with only one or two blazingly obvious puzzles to solve with most of the action occurring off-screen. It feels like they ran out of time and had to finish the game quickly. Several important NPCs appear in the last bit of the game (the actual villain isn't even seen!) and are never developed. One of our 1st-person characters suddenly starts talking like a Bond villain for no apparent reason. The game tries hard to be exciting with horror-movie underscoring and spooky ambient sound, but sadly the story never lives up to it. There is about six hours of game-play here, none of which is very exciting or particularly challenging.<br /><br />In the point-and-click genera [[ASIN:B0017AJMX8 Dracula Origin]]the Sherlock Holmes series (especially the later ones)[[ASIN:B000V9CCLU Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened (PC Games)]][[ASIN:B0016O7RG4 Sherlock Holmes:  Nemesis]],[[ASIN:B000BYTYJI Paradise]],[[ASIN:B000EGIMFA AGON (Ancient Games of Nations): The Mysterious Codex]] etc are similar and more interesting.

First off, reading the Mistborn trilogy is not REQUIRED, but HIGHLY recommended.  It is described as a stand-alone book but I think Allomancy is complicated enough on it's own that you really need to read the earlier trilogy to understand what is going on without it causing any confusion.  But, that is really not a review, is it?  Just take my advise and read the other books first.  They are really good too! (BONUS)  I read this book after having just finished the Mistborn series a few days earlier.  So, I did enjoy the occasional nod toward the old characters.  But, I also then saw the similarities between Kelsier.  I even think it was strong enough that Sanderson himself hints at it near the end of the book.  But, it really isn't a copy of the old series just rehashed, that would be selling it oh, so short.  The characters in this are interesting and likable in their own right.  Sanderson has a knack for making his lead characters likable.  The main villain in this book was also interesting with a hint of Zane from the past.  But, again, maybe a bit took \""likable\"".  I like that Sanderson can make the reader and even the protagonist of the book understand the villains view.  But, I think there could be more depth if the understanding was darker and scarier and just an understandable bad guy.  Throughout the book, there are a lot of references to newspaper-like articles about the history and exploits of Wax and those like him in the Roughs (Wild West).  Another main character even admits to being a fan of them.  This really makes me think of the dime westerns and the quick read of the high-adventure.  The fake news page in the book even has one in it!  But, even with that dime western spirit and Sanderson's gift with writing amazing cinematic action sequences, this book eventually just feels like a pilot episode for some TV show.    It was good.  I really liked it.  It obviously ended in a way that showed that there was more story to tell.  It was not really acliff-hanger.  There was not that type of tension.  This book really did have an ending.  But, it really just seemed like an episode.  I really could see this story continuing.  The main characters have room to grow and Sanderson doesn't seem to be in a big hurry for them to change.  Maybe he is taking a long-view on this story and not just a normal trilogy idea.  I really could see this as a long-term series of short novels.  Another series like that (not fantasy) would be the Anna Pigeon series by Navada Barr.    This could go on for awhile...why three big book of 1000-plus pages.  Why not ten books at 3-400?  Just sayin'...  This book is a good continuation of the Mistborn world.  My rating on it is partially based on my love of the original story.  But, it is a good alloy in itself:  a blend of western dime, cinematic action, tv series-esque, and Sanderson's unique fantasy world magic.  I would give the 3.75-4.0 stars on it's own.  That might be a bit harsh.  I really do think this has a lot of good potential.  If a sequel is published and know I will buy it.  How is that for a statement the publisher wants to hear.  PS-love the maps, keep them coming. (Read Maphead by Ken Jennings for the significance).  :-)",2012-01-08,581,extra_long,2012-01,ebooks

I also did not want to miss out on an opportunity to read another book from Sylvia.<br /><br />Stephanie Martin has had feelings for Nicolas for awhile now, but never thought it would work out because Nick is too much of a play boy.  He goes through women like crazy.  At the annual Christmas party for their law firm though, Stephanie opens up her Secret Santa gift and to her amazement, she is about to get one of her Christmas Wish List items crossed off.  How did Nick know about her secret Wish List...she'll only be able to find out if she asks him.<br />Nicolas has been trying everything to capture Stephanie's interests.  He has been flirting with her for the past months and all of his ex-girlfriends, friends and family members want to know why he just does not ask Stephanie out.

Nicolas though, fought hard to win her over.<br />It may be a short read, but Wish List will keep anyone warm during the cold winter nights for just a short awhile and maybe who knows it will make you want to come up with your own naughty wish list with your significant other....or even win over that special someone you've had your eye on for awhile.<br /><br />I definitely look forward to reading more books from Sylvia very soon.

After listening to its camp, old dramatic radio play style, I felt \""Why Should this project done at all?\"" I should have more than a weak story, which was loosely based on the old comic. book.<br /><br />This audio download start with a Walter Winchell style narrative voice that is over blown and overdrawn caricature of a news reporter. Almost as if it was stole it from the TV series the Untouchable for dramatic effect. The actor that recorded this role should have played it straight.<br /><br /> Most of other acting is played straight and usually works. The one problem I had is the female playing the Domino Lady did not use any vocal shading to created from her normal non super heroine character to the Domino Lady.<br /><br />The ideal of Old Time Radio production style  seems to be misused by the producer. You do not tell a listener you are about to do something then use a sound effect to do it..one or the other is fine.<br /><br />Audio Comix who produce this production, should have padded this production with either more story or a better script. There inventiveness is lacking great execution onto the spoken word medium. At least the Audio Comix company learned its lesson from its first production of not overdosing the listener on a diet of  special effect and mask the dialog with them. I hope their next project is better than this short diversion was. As an exercise is radio theater for experiment, i would say it was good..BUT those type of projects should be left at workshops and not been released publicly to a mass market.<br /><br />I recommend that  this company should invest in the work of Jim French (Imagination Gallery), Jerry Robbins (CRT) or the late Yuri Rasovsky to see how good audio drama is really done..

But he also wrote the best ones, and the best ones are in my top 10 favorite books.<br />That being said, I really hated It. It is the single worst book I've ever read, and I would give it negative stars if allowed. I can't believe I managed to finish it.<br />I decided to buy the book because it has so many good reviews. I don't get it. I don't understand how this book is considered a horror classic.<br />It was long, boring, pointless and not scary at all. Even ridiculous at some parts.<br />It started off ok - some misterious deaths, stuff like that. but then it goes on a while without anything happening. Well, let's say it takes about 200 pages of nothing before something interesting happen. Then, you start getting curious and the book goes back to being boring.<br />The most interesting parts were the ones when the main characters have problems with bullies, and you want to  keep reading to find out if they manage to scape. The rest of the book is a lot of nothing. Sometimes, a character comes up and you start thinking \""who the hell is this\"", and have to go back and find out if the character was mentioned before. It's something like: there is something happening that is the main plot. Then, there is the by-stander. King tells the name of the by-stander, what he does, what happened to him when he was a child, if he is married, and goes on for several pages. You figure the by-stander is an important character after all. Turns out he wasn't, and in not mentioned ever again.<br />There are a lot of characters you figure are important and wants to know what happen to them, and you don't. They're simply forgotten.<br />The way the main characters deal with the It monster is pathetic.<br />I had a really hard time concentrating on this book, and was easily distracted while reading it.

Go buy [[ASIN:B000000WCV Homework]] or [[ASIN:B000059MEK Discovery]]. The former pretty much transformed dance music in the 90s (and is included on several Best Of lists for electronica), while the second redefined the group's sound, resulting in more than one single that would become dance club mainstays. The point is that these guys already had a sound that meshed well with clubs. This album, however, was created -- so the title seems to suggest -- so as to \""clubify\"" even more some of their best known tracks.<br /><br />The result is a failure.<br /><br />1. Ouverture: The only brand-new track, it stands out as an intro-set for the album. It's expansive, dark, and sounds just like the Daft Punk from the previous two albums, even if it's not a particularly interesting or driven song. (4*s)<br /><br />2. & 10. & 12. Aerodynamic: The original was a fun, energetic, uplifting tech-anthem. The first remix, by Daft Punk, isn't bad (4*s), but it pretty much sounds like the original track except three times as long with a few random samples stirred unobtrusively into the mix. The Slum Village remix is abysmal, with the original track sublimated beneath some lackadaisical and not particularly skilled rapping (1*). The final version is nothing but the original one stripped down to its basic components, the volume raised, and the time stretched way out. It's an alienating mess (2*s).<br /><br />3. & 7. Harder Better Faster Stronger: The original is one of their best known songs, a light-hearted industrial-style song with a beat like a piston and an unrelentingly slippery lyrical train. This album has two remixes. The first, by Neptune, is mostly atonal and distracted. It's not all that bad, but it does make the song sound a little sloppy and a lot cheesy (3*s). The second remix by Jess & Crabbe is simply bewildering. The first half sounds just like the original song if you tried to twist the beat into a mobius strip, but the second half suddenly collapses into some kind of dark digital box pop that totally neuters the song's original upbeat tempo (2*s).<br /><br />4. & 8. Face To Face: The original is a classic house track that, while repetitive, still has a fun, party-like backbone. It's the kind of song you can both dance and relax to. The first remix (by Cosmo Vitelli) has its moments, but in general it sounds like what you'd get when someone tries to remix a song for the first time. The rhythm of the song is awkwardly mutated and portions of the melody sound like they were hastily slapped together (2*s). The Demon remix is just as bad. It sounds like an unfinished track, as if someone started by setting up the harmonics for the background but forgot to include an actual foreground to the piece (2*s).<br /><br />5. Phoenix: The original I never cared that much for. It's like the shadow of a dance song. It has a catchy beat and some nice melodies, but it doesn't sound fully realized. The Basement Jaxx remix, however, sounds like a joke. It begins with just an absolutely awful sample of someone screaming and laughing the name of the song. Then Basement Jaxx (a group I normally enjoy for their rambunctiousness) basically pukes all over the song, beating it out of all recognizable shape with industrial ratchetings and oddly placed sea sounds (1*).<br /><br />6. Digital Love: The original is a simple club anthem with a happy sheen and a glossy feel. It's one of those dance tracks that might seem overproduced to some, but which is a guaranteed good time when it's played on the dance floor. Boris Duglosh (whoever that is) remixes it here, and I honestly couldn't tell much of a difference between it and the original other than an extra three minutes of padding (3*).<br /><br />9. Crescendolls: The original is a sort of one-song party anthem; basically the kind of song you play just to get people to jump up and down a lot and scream. It's fun, although not particularly exceptional. Laidback's remix is not laid back at all. It is the same as the original song with the tempo cranked up a bit, spun in a circle, and then distorted into a loop. In other words, the kind of thing that really, really gets annoying after about two minutes (2*s).<br /><br />11. Too Long: This is the only song on Discovery that I didn't like. Its lounge sound and cheesy, candle-lit lyrics seemed out of place on that otherwise stellar album. If anything, I like Gonzales' remix here better than the original. He tones the music down to match the rest of the song, and his voice is very beautiful. Still, though, it doesn't sound like a song Daft Punk would or should write (3*s).<br /><br />13. One More Time: You've probably heard the original. I used to like it until it was played to death in clubs and on the radio (still is in some parts of the world). Romanthony's unplugged remix is the polar opposite of the original track, and I like it even less. The lyrics are leaned on heavily, and with a very fake-sounding passion, making the song sound like it's making fun of itself (1*).<br /><br />14. Something About Us: This was and still is one of my favorite Daft Punk tracks. It's a little slower than their usual fare, but it's smooth, funky, and seamless. I can't really tell much of a difference between the original and remix here, other than that this remix seems to take less time to get to the point, and so it's about a minute shorter (4*s).<br /><br />Overall: 2.4 stars.

Despite its title, There Be Dragons is not a fantasy tale about a dragon filled land, but rather a historical epic from director Roland Joff&eacute; ([[ASIN:B00198X0WW The Mission]] and [[ASIN:B00004RF82 The Killing Fields]]) set during the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s.  The dragon reference is symbolic of human frailties and dealing with and overcoming such \""dragons\"" as fear, resentment, hatred, and betrayal with love and forgiveness.  Originally released last May, the film has been re-cut for release in the United States. In tandem with the U.S. revision, American composer Robert Folk was tasked with rescoring the film, originally scored by Stephen Warbeck.  Folk has a long history of film scoring under his belt including Beastmaster 2, [[ASIN:B000008LOC Toy Soldiers]], and Neverending Story 2, in addition to several classical works.<br /><br />Folk assembled all the right elements to give the score an epic, larger than life feel including an 86-piece orchestra utilized for the entire recording, a 28-member choir, Spanish acoustic guitar, militaristic marching percussion, and occasional brass fanfares.  With a short time frame to compose and record the score the producers and Folk settled on a thematic approach.  Folk composed five memorable themes to highlight prominent elements in the film including a Heroic Theme, Epic Theme, Love Theme, Mystery Theme, and Religious Theme.<br /><br />The Spanish ambiance of the score is immediately present with a Spanish-themed acoustic guitar tune opening \""Main Titles.\""  The acoustic guitar makes an appearance in just about every single cue, most often adding Spanish accents and coloring.  However, the guitar does occasionally take center stage such as in the noble \""Priest's Calling.\""  The guitar really adds a nice flavor to the score.<br /><br />The guitar prelude in the \""Main Titles\"" gives way to a short string performance of the Epic Theme, which is used often to support dramatic sequences (\""More Dad,\"" \""Pray for Him,\"" \""Oriol is Dead,\"" \""An Epic Story\""). Immediately following is the percussion backed Heroic Theme, which is used throughout the score for action sequences (\""Battle Begins,\"" \""Hanging Bridge Battle,\"" \""Battle for Madrid,\"" \""Train Station Patriots\"").  A bold, trumpet fanfare with choir rounds out the majesty of the first track on the album.  The \""Battle Begins\"" continues the intensity with an exciting restatement of the Heroic Theme paired again with propulsive, marching percussion.  The combination of triumphant brass, chorus, and driving percussion make the first two cues highlights of 2012.  Equally pleasing, but for different reasons is the third cue \""Romance.\""  This cue introduces a sweet, Barry-esque, romantic melody filled with acoustic guitar accents and a beautiful wordless choir.  The other romantic highlight of the album comes later in the cue \""Idilko By The Lake.\""  The first three tracks definitely get the festivities started off with a bang!<br /><br />The choir plays an important role throughout the score elevating each of the themes.  Much of the choir is wordless, but in the excellent \""Love and War Finale\"" the choir comes to the forefront and sings powerfully to the Epic Theme in grand fashion.<br /><br />Folk employs a beautiful flowing, melodious string rhythm backed by beautiful choir for his Religious Theme as heard in \""More Dad\"" and \""Lord Open My Eyes.\""  For the Mystery Theme he uses a sonorous repeating, seesaw string rhythm, which effectively conveys intrigue and mystery during several cues.  \""Monolo Starts His Story,\"" \""Franco's Government Files,\"" \""The Priest, I Knew Him,\"" and the best of the bunch, \""Robert's Investigation\"" with its choral accompaniment, feature this well constructed theme.  I have often found enjoyment in musical portrayals of mystery suchas James Horner's excellent \""Too Many Secrets\"" from [[ASIN:B0000028UQ Sneakers]] and Folk's theme is an enjoyable edition to that genre.<br /><br />The flow of the album presentation suffers somewhat from the shorter length of several cues.  Especially jarring is the edit between the first and second tracks.  Obviously Folk recorded the two cues as one piece and their separation on the album is unfortunate.<br /><br />The score offers a good mix of drama, action, and choral beauty and the number of themes add sufficient variety and depth.  The Epic Theme tends to get a little more airtime then the other themes, but this is a minor detraction to the overriding beauty and quality of the music.

Her lyrics remind of a young Neil Peart; \""Quitters\"" embraces \""Subdivisions\"" themes of alienation and reconciliation but turns them inward to the interpersonal and existential. This artistic viewpoint finds its fulfillment in the mystically sublime \""White Noise\"" and in the beautiful touch of \""The Same Things,\"" which are worth the price of the CD alone. The duet \""I Belong with You\"" (with Ryan Lerman) and \""What Breaks (and What Doesn't)\"" also soar above the average. Unfortunately, the rest of the CD remains more fascinating in theory than the actual execution fulfills. The difficulty with \""Quitters\"" is that too many of these songs simply quit. Especially in the lyrics.<br /><br />This lyrical breakdown is obvious on \""Things are Alright\"" and \""Maybe True Stories\"" which feature such cringe inducing lyrics as \""I am giving myself headaches/I am eating foods I hate\"" and \""Liars are as liars do/And if you do it's off to Hell with you\"". It's also a problem on songs like \""I Will Burn You Down\"" and \""In The Next Room\"". It's maddening because the music to all these songs sounds good enough; it's a damn shame the lyrics on these songs read like something written by a 13 year old Sylvia Plath.<br /><br />If I were to take a guess I think the underlying problem is by writing the songs, playing the instruments, and doing the production (which is solid btw) Ms. O'Connell winds up being a \""jack-of-all-trades, master of none.\"" Sometime it all comes together and the result is splendorous and sometimes it doesn't and it's wince inducing.

Hence, this download. In expert mode Premiere is a powerful app, allowing nondestructive editing and blending of multiple video and audio tracks. Not as polished an interface nor as easy to use as iMovie, but more powerful and flexible.<br /><br />I shot my concert with two Canon DSLRs with sound recorded on a Tascam DR100. I dragged clips onto the video channel/tracks (3 channel default), trimmed, blended clips from the two camera feeds, added transitions, titles and credits. Next, I dropped in the stereo track from the Tascam (edited in Bias Peak) and synchronized it to the mono track from the DSLRs. No time code so it took some toil to make finger movement line up with the music track, but in magnify mode you can move the track in 1/10 of a second increments. Premiere has an audio mixer in the tools menu I used to mute the mono tracks from the cameras and turn up the stereo track from the Tascam. Repeated the before mentioned workflow for a dozen sets and got faster each time.<br /><br />I found Premiere intuitive to use and barely needed to crack the help files. An easy learning curve for anybody with basic audio or video experience as these types of apps are similar in concept. Also, the editing controls and processing are nimble and quick. The only thing slow about this app is uploading and that is due to the huge HD files I'm uploading to YouTube and not the app's fault.<br /><br />GOTCHAS: Unfortunately, not all is bright and sunny in Adobe land. Premiere 11 could be a great product with some serious testing and debugging. The gotchas are repeatable and persistent bugs. I use the ultra stable Adobe Premium Web and Creative Design Suite, so I was shocked to find so many bugs in an Adobe product. First, the audio randomly mutes when I playback video. Try again and it's fine. The settings input into the audio mixer in the tools menu often don't stick. Try a second or third time and it might work. The apply button for text/title effects randomly grays out and won't work. And, yes, worse of all, it regularly crashes or freezes. I'm running Lion 10.7.6 on a Mac Pro with 24GB of RAM and two half full 3TB hard drives, so there are no RAM or scratch disk jams. And Premiere 11 is supposed to be compatible with Lion (Mountain Lion is not mentioned). Premiere 11 is the only app I have problems with, and I run a lot of music and graphics apps. If wasn't for the bugs, Premiere 11 would be a 4 or 5 star app, not a 2 or 3 stars. What surprises me about this product is all the professional reviews on websites and magazines have been so positive and glowing. How many of those reviewers actually used the product? Will Adobe turn this app around with a timely update? I hope so but am still waiting...<br /><br />Finally--and this is my fault as I knew better--shop around a few days before buying from Amazon as prices often fluctuate. I paid $85 for the Premiere 11 download from Amazon Digital Services. Two days later it was $50 and then $45.<br /><br />Update 12/11/2012: I upgraded my OS (Lion) to Mountain Lion (OS 10.8.2) and every app on my Mac worked fine. But the big surprise was Premiere 11 as it became stable and didn't crash or freeze once in an editing session. Still has those other above mentioned bugs and but least I can do my work without having to pull the power cord to reboot. If Adobe ever fixes the other bugs I'll come back and add a star or two.<br /><br />Update 4/29/2013: The \""Share\"" function for YouTube and Facebook no longer works. Well, it \""pretends\"" to work but gives an error message at the end of the upload. There have been several Mac OS updates (10.8.5) as well as changes to FB and YouTube these past few months and one of them probably broke Premiere's upload feature. Yes, you can still save the video clip to the desktop and upload through Safari or FireFox. It would be nice if Adobe issued updates to fix bugs and maintain compatibility with the current OS, FB and YouTube, but they're busy with their new subscription cloud apps...<br /><br />Update 12/7/2013: After many months of not working, the \""Share\"" function for YouTube and Facebook works again. I'm guessing my OS upgrade to 10.9 Mavericks had something to do with it as Adobe hasn't issued any bug updates whatsoever (other than a paid update to Elements 12).s and maintain compatibility with the current OS, FB and YouTube, but they're busy with their new subscription cloud apps...<br /><br />Update 12/7/2013: After many months of not working, the \""Share\"" function for YouTube and Facebook works again.

Second, I think this movie was just as challenging for me to watch as it was for him to play the role of Malcolm Grey. Third,this is the darkest role you'll ever see Idris play and believe me,it is hard to watch. The movie illustrates just how fragile the mind can be.There were so many twists and turns in the movie,such that just when you thought you knew where the plot was leading you, it took a sharp right turn and jumped off the cliff. I've never seen him in such a vulnerable role. Idris' performance showed just how serious of an actor he really is. The movie directing was good once you got past the combat scene(sorry,but it was terrible), granted the combat scene was very important for the plot, but they could've been better. Sincerely,I've seen better gunfights on Modern Warfare 3. Finally, the reason I gave this movie a 4 star instead of a 5 is because I'm an Action flick type of guy and i don't do emotional movies..Why? cause they make me feel sad afterwards.

They run around the game world asking for girlfriends. They say \""gf needed\"". Who would want their little girl playing a game where older men are asking if they would be their girlfriend? Ick! It's worse than ick.<br /><br />The gameplay is pretty limited. You need to pay a monthly fee to gain access to most everything in the game. And when you do, it's still limited. You can't change the colors of any of the furniture or clothes, leaving you with only a few colors for furniture and one set color for the clothes. There are around 25 flash games you can play in the game, almost all of them are by yourself. They are mostly little casual flash games, they only take a few minutes to play. They are fun at first, but get boring after playing them a few times. You'll want to play them again and again though, because it's a way for you to earn money in the game so you can shop for new items. So after a while you'll be doing the same thing over and over again, where the only goal is to get money. Not very encouraging is it.<br /><br />Many items are only available for a limited time. What that means, is that if you don't get an item when it was available during it's short period, you will never ever be able to get it. You'll see many other characters with items you will never ever get to have. The game makers say the game encourages dress up and imagination. Well how does it encourage that if only a few select special people get to do it? My daughter deserves heck of a lot more than that.<br /><br />There is a good chat filter in the game, but it's good and bad. It's good because it blocks nearly every single word in the dictionary, it's bad because it blocks nearly every single word in the dictionary. I can't say the most innocent of words. Many people find ways to get around it, creating new bad words in the game word that don't get filtered. Someone even tried to get me to go to another web site in the game. Speaking of that, the community isn't as nice as the game makes it sound. You get to decorate your very own house in the game. When you start the game, you have zero furniture, so your place is bare empty. Once you make friends, they can visit your house and rate it. Well guess what, I made a few \""friends\"" and they went to my place and all rated it 1 star out of 5 stars. Now whenever I visit my own house, I see the rating shoved in my face that 10 people found my house 1 star worthy. How's that for being nice? Being new, you don't have any money to decorate it. Speaking of which, if you like Facebook, where everyone is everyones friend, then maybe this game will teach your girl to like Facebook too. Because that's how this game is, everyone makes everyone elses friend regardless of who they are or what they say. See a stranger? Someone tries to make them their friend. If you value friendship, where one good friend is more important than 200 people you barely know, then this game does not teach a good lesson.<br /><br />I will not let my child play this. I think the game deserves 2 stars because I like the idea of creating a game for girls, where they can play with others girls and do girly things, but lets face it... she deserves better than having old men hit on her. <shivers>",2012-07-19,655,extra_long,2012-07,games

Save to a disc, and when you are done close and then reopen the program. You should then see the start page and you can begin a new return.

Harvard lawyer turned writer, David Feintuch was able to spin a good yarn. I've read most of the series, and was unable to abandon any of the books I read.<br /><br />Feintuch draws his dystopian Reunification Church and its subordinate United Nations government in murky shades of gray. The uniformity and omnipresence of this vaguely Catholic religion, for all its weirdness, is taken at face value by the people who live under it. Though not quite as extreme as the Imperium theocracy of the Warhammer 40k universe, there is a resemblance.<br /><br />His conception of a space faring navy of adolescents is as laughable as the medical rationale behind it. The juxtaposition of 19th century naval discipline against a modern technological culture strains credibility to bursting. I didn't pick up on the homoerotic vibe that other reviewers mention, but I can't help thinking that Feintuch must have had a 'thing' for spanking.<br /><br />Feintuch's anti-hero Captain Nick Seafort does nearly everything wrong, then consistently succeeds beyond all reasonable expectations. He spends most of his waking hours in an ecstasy of mental self-flagellation over his mistakes. I don't think I've ever read a less likable protagonist.<br /><br />The Fish are the bad guys--essentially giant space-going amoebae. They are credited with being able to improve their tactics, but never fleshed out with motives. Consequently they inspire the emotional response that a tsunami would, rather than an opposing fleet. The characters don't defeat the fish, they survive them.<br /><br />Although never explicitly assigned color or race, the overtly and cartoonishly racist depiction of the Transpop urban culture is an unholy cross between blaxploitation material and blackface comedy. This theme doesn't make an appearance in the first book, but is a blight on the remainder of the series.<br /><br />Given the real skill behind Feintuch's writing, I think he may have been laughing at his audience the whole time. Although reading the books was not entirely unpleasant, ultimately I was not amused. Approach with caution. Nowhere near the best of the genre.",2012-05-01,350,long,2012-05,ebooks

Boxall, the writer, was born in England. He has worked as a print journalist and has won multimedia awards in the areas of educational CD's and non-fiction. The Great Firewall is his first novel and it's a good one.<br /><br />The story begins with a clip from Daniel Skye's computer game. Set in Shanghai's 1923 White Russian community it's called The Riding Instructor and the game's action takes place in the corrupt, violent society, poverty stricken immigrants, fleeing from the Russian revolution had no other choice but to settle in. As the period of history between the two world wars is of interest to me this book grabbed my attention from page one with the author's intense descriptions of life in downtown 1920's Shanghai - lots of fun if you're cashed up, the pits if you're not.<br /><br />Daniel's game has the facility to allow players to create their own movies by editing and putting together clips in seemingly endless permutations. This appeared unlikely to succeed to me as it sounded complicated, but as I'm not au fait with the workings of computer games, it's probably quite plausible to those who are. Daniel, convinced of the future success of The Riding Instructor, if he can raise enough capital to complete and market it, has put his heart and all his finances into the project. Like all great ideas there are pitfalls to avoid lest your idea and money sinks into a great big black hole. When the story switches to present day, Daniel is teetering on the brink of a particularly large black hole; he's virtually bankrupt and his wife, Sophia, extremely annoyed at the reversal of their joint finances has left him. Daniel's only recourse to get the project and maybe his wife back on track is to fly to Shanghai to get his influential friend, Pierre to introduce him to investors. The only flaw to this manouvere is that in a parting shot, Sophia tells Daniel that Pierre has recently tried to seduce her - not something that pleases Daniel but he figures after he gets Pierre's help to raise funds he will confront him with Sophia's accusation.<br /><br />Arriving in Shanghai, Daniel is drawn into Pierre's shadowy world of political dissidents, corrupt government officials and ruthless property developers. China, recently emerged as a powerful player in world financial markets is a frightening place to be when you're not sure who your friends are or if you have any. Vulnerable and alone, Daniel is faced with a choice: be a success and damn the consequences or be a success and remain true to those that matter; his family and the dispossessed residents of Shanghai.<br /><br />There's a lot to like in The Great Firewall, the writing is uniformly good, the suspense and excitement level are high and the reader really wants Daniel Skye to succeed both as a businessman and as a compassionate human being. An absorbing read, I will be watching for Michael C. Boxall's next book.",2012-03-13,543,extra_long,2012-03,ebooks

For the most part I have found it very helpful.  However, there are times I don't understand the way something is worded on the TT screen, but selecting Help takes me to IRS instructions which don't explain the TT wording or for which the connection to the TT screen is not clear.  I believe the Help materials have decreased in quality over the years.<br /><br />I also have an uncommon situation:  I live in a foreign country which requires me to pay income tax.  For that reason, I choose not to take the Foreign Earned Income (FEI) exclusion, because I would rather the US gov't get my money than the gov't where I live.  But this year TT would not let me not take the FEI exclusion.  No matter how many times I chose not to take it, the program would always automatically change my answer!  Tech support could not find a way around this.  The bottom line is that I struggled with this right up to the filing deadline & ended up needing to file by mail, because the program would not let me e-file the way it was.  I missed the deadline due to this bug.<br /><br />Which brings me to my final gripe:  Tech Support.  The last guy spent 4 hours with me on a chat trying to figure this out, which is really above & beyond.  But the prior contacts with Tech Support were more like efforts to convince me that I was doing something stupid and there was really no problem.  You have to badger these people incessantly to admit that there is actually a bug in their program.  Even then, they're not about to fix it!

I could have purchase a key directly from an Office program but Microsoft made a condition that I had to sign up for hotmail and other social media accounts in order to buy the download.

In the end I rounded up since it was a sufficiently sugary mental bonbon to satiate my inner 13 year old, but before you click to buy it take the following to heart:<br /><br />Our stars for this novel are Pagan and Dank, yes Dank, like a mildewy basement... I had issues from the beginning with these overblown names but whatever.. We don't know what Pagan or Dank look like (later in the book we get Dank has 1)dark hair 2)blue eyes...wow). In fact we don't know what most people or places in this world look like. Details shmeetails!! The author also seems to have some serious issues with clunky word choice, like the line \""I hadn't taken into account that studying with Leif last period would be impossible since all football players must report to the field during last period.\""<br /><br />Must report to the field during last period?? Could you not just say \""football practice starts during last period\""? There were about a dozen of these weirdly phrased lines throughout the story and they knocked me out of the story every time I came across one.<br /><br />Then there are the weird implausibilities. Like we're told Dank can't be with Pagan for some secret reason, which I can buy, but for some reason this also means he NEEDS to get handsy with this other girl? And then he has the audacity to deliver the \""it's hurting me more than you, baby\"" line. I get that Dank can't be with Pagan, that's called plot, but there's NO reason why he can't stay single. Then as others have pointed out Pagan is sent to a inpatient psych clinic for PTSD, because they specialize in that, but NO ONE else there seems to have PTSD. We never hear mention of her talking to a counselor, being given meds, cognitive therapy, exposure therapy. Come on!!! I looked this stuff up in a 5 minute Google search. Oh and Gatlinburg doesn't open for skiing until December, not that a snowy Thanksgiving in Tennessee wasn't already a big enough stretch of the imagination. The list goes on and on...  There's a bunch of stuff that you have to just ignore and keep chugging through because if you stop and think your head will explode and your kindle will shoot out the window.<br /><br />Lastly, there's Pagan.

It's kind of strange she continues to do that even after A)getting emotional and running off almost gets her killed and B)she thinks someone is after her and she's safer in the company of people. I would go on analyzing everything wrong with her emocentric character but I don't want to spend more time thinking about her character than the author did.<br /><br />So why after all this did I give it 3 stars? Well it was readable, minus the couple of lapses into stilted English I mentioned. And as I said earlier this was a mental bonbon of a story.

Some aspects are interesting to watch.  Others are not.  The movie falls just short of the mark to be classic.  The movie is also just good enough to keep it out of the garbage category.  Viewers who enjoy classic science fiction movies of the 40s and 50s may appreciate the better qualities of this movie.  While this movie was released in 1961, it has more characteristics of a 50s movie than a 60s movie.<br /><br />Space ships keep disappearing.  A viewer learns that the reason for the disappearances is an asteroid populated by people who have the technology to keep the asteroid invisible.  At the beginning of the movie we see a space ship accelerating at 11 g's.  Though the ship is accelerating at 11 g's, the men on board have little problem moving and are awake and alert.  The technology of the future is amazing.  Today, pilots pass out somewhere around 8 or 9 g's, and movement is very difficult.<br /><br />On the other hand, the cockpit of the space ship was outstanding.  Some of the instruments made little sense, but the controls were nicely arranged, and a number of features made this cockpit above average for science fiction movies of the late 50s and early 60s.<br /><br />A short time later the two crewmen on the space ship are walking about on the exterior of the ship without restraints.  It appears that the men are pulled toward this ship as though there was gravity toward the ship.  The men's shoes looked a lot like street shoes.<br /><br />Captain Frank Chapman (Dean Fredericks) survives the crash of his ship on the mysterious asteroid.  Chapman stumbles from his ship and swears he sees little people about the size of those in Lilliput.  After opening his helmet, Chapman too shrinks to the size of the little people, which has something to do with the atmosphere of the asteroid and the fields surrounding the asteroid.  We later discover that the name of the asteroid is Rayton.<br /><br />The little people speak English because all languages on Rayton are translated through voice tone waves, or something like that.  I love scientific gobbledygook double-speak.  We need the English because Chapman is suddenly part of some kind of love quadrangle.  Liara (Coleen Gray) is the hot blonde babe who is a social climber.  Zetha (Delores Faith) is a beautiful mute babe who is shy and has a major crush on Chapman.  Exposure to an enemy Solarite warrior caused Zetha to become mute.  The other guy in this movie is Herron (Anthony Dexter), who loves Liara, though she is fickle.<br /><br />After some fighting and the usual male bonding, Chapman and Herron become great friends.  The people of Rayton realize that Chapman is an all right guy, so they decide, after a huge fight with the Solarites involving lots of hand movements over lighted plastic (which controlled their fields and weapons) that it is time for Chapman to go home.  But wait, a critical fight scene with a captured Solarite has to happen.  I actually felt sorry for the Solarite, who was played by Richard Kiel, the future Jaws of James Bond fame.  The costume apparently had poor visibility because Kiel had a hard time walking down stairs or moving in general.<br /><br />Eventually Chapman is repatriated and the movie ends, but not before the most awful audio effects I have ever heard in a movie.  Many movies use an echo effect or reverberation effect for the narrator.  In this case, the narrator literally repeated the same lines over and over, with the volume reduced each time.  The ending was like an Ed Wood moment for this film.<br /><br />This movie has too much hokum to qualify as a classic.  However, it still has its moments and I recommend it to people who like science fiction movies of the 50s.  Just be sure to keep your expectations low.  If you believe there were only six good science fiction movies made during the period 1950 to 1961, I can guarantee you that this movie was not one of them.<br /><br />Good luck!se all languages on Rayton are translated through voice tone waves, or something like that.

Filmmakers try to make kids' movies that will appeal to grown ups too. That idea describes this collection of music well.<br /><br />I get a kick out of how much my son enjoys Rolf Harris' \""Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport\"". This collection of songs not only has the sense of fun that will appeal to children, many of the songs are favorites of grown ups who listen to the Dr. Demento show. The compilers also thought to include songs that have become iconic, tunes such as the original \""Animal Crackers In My Soup\"" by Shirley Temple. The songs here are the originals, not some cheesy remake by a studio chorus or some children's entertainer. Even with some of the tracks that you wouldn't want to hear repeatedly, the compilers were on the right track. These particular songs by Alvin & the Chipmunks or Spike Jones & His City Slickers might not be your favorites, but if a volume two comes out, perhaps other recordings by those same acts might be more appealing. That's still worlds better than Barney.<br /><br />All of the recordings sound fine, I don't hear any brutal audio cleanup imposed on these fifty or sixty year old recordings.<br /><br />I give this four instead of five stars because of the one minor weakness in this collection - Disney material makes up about a fourth of this list. Ever notice how compilations deliberately avoid wasting space on top artists who had so many hits that a consumer might as well just get their greatest hits? Compilations do best when they give a home to songs that might not so readily find a home - one hit wonders, novelties, up and coming artists, things like that. With children's music, there are so many Disney collections out there already, so full of well-known standards from seventy years of film and recording. Throwing in a dozen or so scattershot selections from a library that huge only displaces great songs that could have been included here instead. That said, although the artists aren't listed as \""Disney\"" or by the name of the respective film, every Disney song here sounds to be the original soundtrack version.<br /><br />But no complaints here, my playlist is still packed with a good thirty songs. \""Pickin' a Chicken\"" clucks me up every time I hear it, and the Lonnie Donegan number is the most hilarious song here.

The film is filled with an extraordinary cast of Italian actors, most of whom we do not know but who deliver some of the most memorable characterizations in recent years. The title for the film `loose cannons' refers to an irresponsible and reckless individual whose behavior (either intended or unintended) endangers the group he or she belongs to. There could not be a better title for this film that examines family life in contemporary Italy.<br /><br />The film opens with a prelude of a beautiful woman in a bridal gown running across the fields toward the ancient house where she embraces a man Nicola (Giorgio Marchesi, watch his star rise!) and then is lead to her planned wedding to another man. The story then begins. Tommaso (Riccardo Scamarcio) is the youngest son of the Cantone family who own and operate a pasta factory in southern Italy. At a family dinner, parents Vincenzo (Ennio Fantastichini) and Stefania (Lunetta Savino) Cantone plan on turning over the factory to their two sons, Antonio Cantone (Alessandro Preziosi) and Tommaso Cantone. The younger Tommaso, who has returned home from business school in Rome for this dinner, has his own important news that he plans on divulging at that dinner. Beforehand, he tells Antonio his news. He is not in business school and is not at all interested in running the factory, leaving that to Antonio. Rather, he wants to stay in Rome to be a writer - he has submitted a manuscript of a novel to a publisher - but more importantly that he is gay. Tommaso is certain that their parents will respond with anger and be non-supportive. But before Tommaso can make his statement at the dinner, Antonio, who has been working at the factory for years, drops his own bombshell of news that HE is gay on the family, which results in Vincenzo disowning Antonio and having a mild heart attack. Tommaso feels that he has no other choice now but to keep quiet, stay in the closet, and remain at home to run the factory while his father recuperates. A beautiful worker at the factory, Teresa (Paola Minaccioni) though she has problems of her own, is supportive and close to Tommaso, giving the family the idea that all is `straight' with Tommaso. But a visit from Rome by Tommaso's flamboyant gay friends - including Tommaso's lover, Marco (Carmine Recano) - may make life difficult for Tommaso as he tries to balance his priorities in life. His sister Elena (Bianca Nappi) reassures Tommaso that she has know of his sexual preference for years and loves him just the same.

Been a fan since just before Den Of Thieves came out.  However, this EP perplexes me.  The songs, themselves, are pretty decent, but I don't think the material was worthy of releasing an EP for.  If this is a 'release songs that didn't/won't make the cut on an LP' release, I can see that.  However, the music here just doesn't catch on like 90% of their other songs do.  Fans should be pretty happy with this, but I don't see this grabbing others outside the established fanbase.  Then again, as a fan, I'm simply in the middle with the release anyway, so not even sure the target market will give the disc multiple spins.<br /><br />Production-wise, this does come in a little light.  Seems like more of an album of studio jam sessions that were basically recorded live.  Not as glossy as some of their other albums, but not bad either.  I actually like the more 'rustic' sound.<br /><br />As I said, the songs themselves are mildly enjoyable.  'Not Yours To Love' is a favorite of mine so far.

You do get a lot of the effects and prerecorded sound bites along with virtual instruments, but you have to download a lot of information, kind of makes me wish it was included with the original software download.<br /><br />The only real thing that I don't like is the lack of the declick and noise reduction effects, or at least I couldn't find them. Even most free music editors have these as standard, it hopefully won't be a problem once I get a good mic but for now these effects are well missed.<br /><br />As the user interface goes you couldn't ask for much simpler. You can simply drag to place the desired sound bites into what ever track you want and even drag the sound bite out longer to get it to repeat, which saves a lot of time. It is also very easy to figure out where everything is and right clicking works like a charm to find the needed effects.<br /><br />One of the best things about the program is that it requires very little processing power to run. With Windows 7 on my laptop (purchased end of 2009 for around $500) which isn't what you could call a performance computer at all, Music Maker runs perfectly, and the undo function reserves a lot of information so you can go back several steps in case you didn't like a change in the end.<br /><br />To sum it up.<br /><br />A good program for the price, very easy to use interface and lots of effects that can be applied in several ways. Also it runs well on a mediocre machine so you won't need a super computer to use it.<br />Unfortunately it does not include noise reduction or declick effects (maybe I just couldn't find them).<br/>Also it comes with a lot of canned sound bites and virtual instruments but you have to download them and this will take a little extra time.",2012-06-28,397,long,2012-06,software

GW2 is a game that rewards cooperation and being nice and discourages trollish behavior. Having spent years playing WOW and having people kite mobs toward me so they can steal a mining node or having people flag while I use an AOE attack just so they can force me into PVP, adventuring through GW is a dream. Instead of having to wait around for an NPC to respawn because someone just killed the create you need for a quest, everyone who participates in the fight gets credit for the quest completion. No more grouping up with people and having to roll for loot, only to have someone \""need\"" an idea they can't even use. Each player gets their own loot off of monsters and NPCs. No more rushing to grab a resource node and having someone else swoop in and take it. Nodes are \""character specific\"" and each person can harvest from it. You even get experience for stopping to heal or resurrect an injured player. The game seems built to encourage courtesy and fair play. All I can say is it is about darn time.<br /><br />Combat is fast and exciting, with a wide range of combinations you can use. There is no \""best\"" weapon for a specific class or best talent tree. You can really customize your talents and weapons to suit how you want to play the game. The \""Holy Trinity\"" of tank, DPS, and healer is thrown out the window. Instead, you really need to have solid situational awareness and pay attention to what NPCs and monsters are doing. While the Guardian profession has a few abilities to pull aggro, for the most part you really can't \""tank\"" in this game. So each player participating in an event needs to be paying attention. All professions have some healing options available to them and can resurrect fallen players during combat. This actually encourages better cooperation between players, instead of everyone just yelling because \""the tank can't hold aggro\"" or \""the healer sucks.\""<br /><br />Crafting is an addiction in this game. Discovering new recipes by experimenting is actually rewarding, and unlike WOW the stuff you can craft is actually useful. You don't need to get to X craft rating and unlock uber recipes to get craftable items you will actually want to use. I've been able to equip all of my character by crafting my own weapons, armor, and other trinkets.<br /><br />Environments are varied and interesting, with each racial area having it's own distinct feel and personality. You will want to explore each starting area to experience it. But don't worry about high level players coming into a starting area and screwing up quests. Because the game scales you down to the level of the area to avoid high level players coming in and disrupting the experience.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have, however, is the spamming of gold sellers. GW really needs to take action to neutralize the gold sellers. I'm currently getting a half dozen \""spam\"" messages in my in-game mail each day. Chat is a constant barrage of competing gold sellers, sometimes two or three for the same gold-selling site! It really does disrupt enjoyment of the game, particularly when in cities and trying to enjoy conversations with other players.<br /><br />While I like the concept of the individual stories, in practice they are very linear and I don't feel engaged with them. I have no control over HOW my character responds in most cases. Sure, in some cases I get two chose between two or three options insofar as how to resolve a quest, but this generally boils down to whether to sneak into area A, frontal assault area B, or join some NPC to infiltrate area C. I was a little put off after rolling my thief only to have her in the opening dialogue go on about how heroic Captain Thackary is. I'm playing a thief! Why am I so quick to help the law? You really have no control over the personality of your character. There is the charisma, dignity, ferocity options: but this is poorly handled and really does nothing to give your character a personality. Nor does it actually change how NPCs respond to you. Unlike in [[ASIN:B001CWXAP2 Star Wars: The Old Republic]], where your actions and statements can fundamentally change not just NPC reactions, but actual gameplay.<br /><br />The game overall is a lot of fun to play. I enjoy it a great deal and would give it a higher rating if actual gameplay wasn't so often ruined because of bots and gold spammers.ality. Nor does it actually change how NPCs respond to you.

A style of music that, I believe, is the consecrated successor to the country music of Willie, Waylon and the boys. This genre of music achieves its distinctive country roots by combining country with elements of folk, blues and rock. Lord knows there's really nothing new with that formula. But it's all coalesced to introduce an original, almost providential sound.<br /><br />This is a straight forward contemporary country song by this very talented young performer. This new number was penned by the capable Lee Thomas Miller a songwriter and record producer known to the Country Music crowd as having written several top Country songs for some of the biggest names in Country Music. Maybe Saturday Night is destined for great things. I hope so. Wade has been working his fingers to the bone and he deserves his time in the spotlight.<br /><br />This unification of Miller's songwriting skills to Bowen's unique voice is an encouraging sign that mainstream country music has become conscious of this young performer's extensive abilities. I've attended the outdoor version of his live show. He has great energy. And he leads the crowd in chorus after chorus of their favorite sing-a-long songs.<br /><br />Wade just might be the king of three chords, and a chorus within the Red Dirt genre. Although another of my favorites, Mike Eli of the Eli Young Band is an exceptional artist as well. Both of these Texas troubadours seem to wed a bit of folk music's lyrical honesty with the contemporary tempo of this musical category.<br /><br /> If you're interested in Texas Red Dirt Country Music then you'll need to add this fellow to your collection.

I wanted to see, because after the first 20 minutes I felt the movie was actually pretty good.  Intrigued by the low ratings, I was wondering what was so terrible about it.  So as I continued to watch, a number of things struck me about this film:  1) The acting was actually pretty good.  I'm not a huge Dustin Hoffman fan, but I felt that his acting in this was just as good as any of the other performances I've seen from him.  Liev Schreiber actually gets the best lines with the helium induced vocals in a chamber the main characters entered; followed by a really amusing helium induced refrain from Samuel L. Jackson.  That's about the only humor in the film.  2)  The sets were terrific.  I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised.  3)  The special effects were well done.    4)  There was enough suspense to keep me interested.  5)  It has a great cast of big name stars (Sharon Stone, Samuel L. Jackson, Dustin Hoffman), some well-known supporting stars like Liev Schreiber and Queen Latifah, as well as a minor cameo appearance by Huey Lewis as the helicopter pilot.  So with these elements, what could be wrong with this movie?  Well, for starters, the ending, like in so many science fiction films, does not seem to know where to go.  It was a bit of a letdown.  So the script needed a more intense bang-up ending.  And I guess that's the main problem here; the script.  While the dialogue was not half bad, where the story takes us is rather bland.  I had a sort of \""been there, done that\"" feeling at times throughout the film.    It had elements of several sci-fi films, which I felt were just copies of scenes I'd seen elsewhere; especially the scene where Jackson swallows a piece of deep-fried squid (which he believes is an onion ring), gags on it, and you immediately expect an alien to emerge from his chest.  I noticed that like in Alien, there was cornbread (in the form of muffins) present in the mess hall.  I'm sure it was intended as a bit of a tease, but what happened next was another let-down.  Another film that comes to mind is 2001, and similarities between the computer Hal and Jerry, the mysterious entity of the Sphere (who communicates through the underwater habitat's computer).  I think we've all had quite enough of computers with personalities as characters in sci-fi movies, so I was a bit bored with that aspect.  Most of the characters who died in this film did not have enough character development to make you care that they died.  Not to be cold in any way, but in order to make this a bit more suspenseful, I would have expected a scene or two more involving these characters so that I'm hoping they don't die.  That's what you want to feel in a film like this.  Either they're such terrible and evil characters that you are not disappointed (or are in-fact happy) that they die; or they have become so likable that you hope they don't.  This film does not deliver with caring for the characters either way.  They are like the red shirts in a Star Trek episode.  You're not supposed to care, and that creates part of the disappointment here.  Queen Latifah's character dies early on, and the most intense acting you get from her besides a few lines at the start when they first arrive at the habitat, is the acting she does when being attacked by an army of squids.  Who would care about that unless they knew something about her?  There's no evil characters in the film (not even Jerry, really); which also minimizes the suspense.  It's like the film tried to bank on star power by giving the 3 main stars most of the screen presence; thus diminishing the excitement factor.  The film also seemed to rush into the premise that the characters were being controlled by their own fears; without an adequate explanation for how that was so.  I don't buy much of the premise behind these sorts of psychological thrillers.  I would rather their fears be real (like in the Alien films) rather than figments of their imaginations.  The only film where I was actually frightened by psychological fear was 1997's Event Horizon.  That film had it's flaws too, but the fear factor in that film was much more intense than here - perhaps because the characters who were killed off were much better developed, and you cared about them.  Event Horizon, like Sphere did poorly at the box office, and I'm not quite certain why.  My guess is that in the late 1990s people had tired of the sci-fi/horror genre altogether after having their fill of such films as Independence Day, The Arrival, Species, Alien: Resurrection, Face/Off, Cube, Jurassic Park: The Lost World, Mimic, and Starship Troopers (all films released the previous few years).  Since then several of these films, including Event Horizon have gained cult followings.  This film does not have all the important elements to make it into the cult-following club.  While good as entertainment, it isn't frightening enough to make you want to say to your friends who haven't seen it, \""You've got to watch this!\""  So all-in-all, the film is rather bland.  That's why it earns about 3 stars for me.  While it's not as terrible as most professional reviews assign to it, It's not a film I will go back to and watch more than once.",2012-01-07,956,extra_long,2012-01,videos

I keep my Vista very current using the Windows update site, but the Garmin downloader wanted to upgrade my old garmin downloader before proceeding, ok, so I download the offered upgrade, then it said that it needed a newer version of .NET, a middleware that Microsoft offers to make software developers life easier, if not ours.  The .NET download was large, and took a time to install on my admittedly old and slow laptop, maybe 15 minutes for download and install (7mgbit/sec DSL).  Then the Garmin updater kicked in for the install automatically, very little happens for 5 minutes, then \""unexpected error message, try again, if another failure, call Garmin\"".  So I tried again, same error message.  Then I did troubleshooting 101, rebooted, which btw was never suggested at any time, found the downloaded executable on my system, tried again, it works.  Map download proceeded with a couple of acceptance screens at the beginning, came back from 4 hours later, all done (may have finished earlier, I think it estimated about 2 hours).

I spent some time highlighting the chapters and excerpts that my wife and I agreed add nothing to the story.  These highlighted portions amounted to roughly 25% of the novel.  Mr. Waldron spent the first 10% of the book introducing 2 new characters.  I skipped through the whole thing. Yes, we know Carey is an ass.  Yes, we know they want to leave.  No, we don't understand why you don't just tell the jerk to fly a kite.  No, we don't know why you're afraid of him...other than the wife of the couple is the only one with any guts.  After 10% of the content, we know you're going to leave in 2 weeks.  After trying to get through the alternating chapters that focused on these new characters, I finally just skipped them all completely and focused on the characters from the first book.  It came as no surprise that, after they hooked up with the group from the first book, I found that I had missed absolutely nothing germane to the story.<br /><br />Further examples of irritating verbosity:  Thousands of words devoted to a wedding, finding and picking flowers, shopping for dresses, etc. ad nauseum.  More thousands of words regarding childbirth.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy the interactions between the female and male characters.  Neither did my wife.  It appears that every male character in Mr. Waldron's books are scared to death of their wives/significant others.  Every time they mildly tease them, they spend a lengthy paragraph or 2 apologizing and making sure they don't misunderstand...while hoping they didn't offend.  An excerpt:<br /><br />\""Hey, I remember the time you were all sweetness and light as you promised to cram an entire box of saltines down my throat the next time I offered you one after you got sick. If I remember correctly, there was no mention of unwrapping them first either. I'm no rocket scientist but I don't need to be beaten over the head to learn alesson, or choked to death for that matter.\"" Joel smiled sympathetically at his wife.\""<br /><br />This was after he had his head bitten off for being concerned about his wife's morning sickness.<br /><br />We liked the prequel to this book, but it was also mainly an effort in bending over backwards to cater to women. Mr. Waldron has dialogued and cast almost every male character as a churchmouse.  It definitely detracts from my enjoyment of the books.  My wife feels the same way.  She pointed out that the only man who acts decisively is the Chuck character, who rescues his future sweetheart from a vicious rapist...and then grovels, hoping she doesn't hate him because he killed someone (this from the first book, Dark Grid).  It's also interesting that he has, in effect, changed the Founding Fathers to the Founding Mothers in this second book.  I have no problem recognizing that women are as capable as men.  But this amount of affirmative action in literature is both unnecessary and irritating.<br /><br />I'm also having a hard time understanding the frequent focus on people's dependencies on things like muscle relaxants and anti-depressants.

The content is still there, but the execution on this album is terrible. It feels like they were forced to change their sound on this just to try and attract some attention from people who wouldn't normally listen to them.<br /><br />Interludes aside, the first half of the album sounds like they used the same beat for every song only slightly altering the tempo. That wouldn't be a problem if the production was dope, but it's not. It sounds like some Justin Bieber/Flo Rida/Lady Gaga music. The first half of the album is literally Dead Prez rapping about normal Dead Prez topics, but they're doing it over dance music. Why? What were they trying to accomplish by doing that?<br /><br />The second half of the album provides a little more diversity sonically, but it still isn't anything spectacular. What baffles me is that the two best beats on here are used for the two \""GHN\"" interludes.

Probably the coolest thing about Aika is the politics with people hating on each other non-stop and that drives the warfare in game.<br /><br />Things I don't like is how the game stops you from moving when you use skills, I personally find this frustrating as it can make it feel jerky.

US,13099198,R1XTNL4TAIUEJH,B007P5SGJA,262859449,Tropico 4 - Modern Times DLC [Online Game Code],Digital_Video_Games,2,17,23,False,False,"Modern Times, what it is, and isn't","I can't decide whether this expansion deserves a 3 or a 4 star rating, so for the sake of argument I'll give it a 3.5, but Amazon won't allow that, so 3 it is.<br /><br />Edit: A lot of the missions are bugged, maps are re-used during the campaign even with only 12 of them. I'm not finding the later missions to be much fun and the references to the current political problems in the world seem forced and unfunny. Between the bugged quests and disappointing missions I'm going to lower the score to a 2, there are just too many little annoyances that are ruining this expansion for me.<br /><br />I pre-ordered this on Steam for $16.99, if you're thinking of buying this remember that if you own Tropico 4 on Steam you need to get Modern Times from Steam as well. The boxed version of this expansion for some reason costs $29.99, do yourself a favor and just get this one instead, it's only a small download, about 600 MBs or so, took me about 7 minutes on a mediocre connection.<br /><br />So, what does this expansion offer? You get 12 new missions in a continuing story on different islands much like Tropico 4's main story line. As far as I can tell the island designs are a mix of new and old, but I'll have to comment further on that when I complete it, I'm only on the third island so far.<br />One of the new features is the Time Line, it's a series of historical events that will have an impact on your island. For example the Cuban Missile Crisis will force you to use the Conscription edict, and the Bird Flu Scare will increase the price of beef, and so on. You will also unlock the new buildings in the expansion at certain time intervals, so that you gradually get access to them and upgrade as new things are developed.<br /><br />The new buildings are distinctly different from the Tropico 4 ones in that they lack the personality and the detail. Most of the new buildings are just gray pieces of concrete with windows that look uninspiring. Which is a shame because part of Tropico's charm is the little details added to the buildings that make them distinctly Tropican. The new buildings feel like they belong in a Sim City game and feel really out of place most of the time. Some of them are very useful and sadly some of them make the game a bit too easy. Tropico 4 was already a cakewalk compared to 3, and the Modern Times buildings such as the Bio Farm, the Organic Ranch and the Modern Apartment Building are a bit too good. I found myself just flying through the first two islands with a boat load of money and abundance of happy Tropicans. I wouldn't mind if Kalypso balanced some of these buildings out, maybe make them a bit more expensive or turn up their upkeep so that the game isn't too easy.<br /><br />You also get 10 new edicts relevant to Modern Times. Some are good, some are bad, some seem a bit too good. I would have liked to see a few more interesting ones. I do think whoever put in the \""Ban Social Media\"" edict deserves a pay raise, it's probably one of the funnier things of this expansion. The new edicts probably won't blow your mind or make you think, but at least they're somewhat useful.<br /><br />Now on to my biggest complaints. First of all, it seems like there wasn't that much effort put into actually changing or adding gameplay. There is no learning curve, you can just win games the exact same way as before, the Time Line may add some extra grievances but not enough to actually change the flow of the game. The new buildings mostly function the same as the old ones. It's just trading the old charming buildings for the new, garish and soulless concrete skyscrapers and gigantic farms. Its charm and tongue-in-cheek humor are what sets Tropico apart from other building simulations and I feel like these modern Tropican islands are just dull. They could have added some flavor to the new buildings but most are eyesores and make me wish they weren't so damn good so that I wouldn't feel obliged to build them over the older ones. One thing I do really find irritating that is that you have to demolish old farms and ranches to make room for the new ones, which are gigantic I might add. Because you can't just demolish at your whim you will have to wait till all your goods are out, fire all your workers, wait for the demo guy, free up more space and then build your new things. This is bad design, you should either start with the majority of these buildings available or make them upgradeable somehow. It's not game breaking, but it's not very fun either.<br /><br />One minor complaint is the voice acting. Several of the major characters, such as Sunny and Antonio Lopez, now have different voice actors, but instead of replacing all the dialogue they just added the new dialogue with the new actors to go along with the old dialogue from the old actors. It sounds weird, especially with the new Sunny having a completely different inflection and accent. I can live with it, I just found it rather odd to hear two different voices for the same character.<br /><br />Still, I think the Steam version was decent value, you get some new, albeit ugly buildings, some new edicts, 12 new missions and new islands for $19.99. It's better value than the terrible DLCs they've been releasing at least. I don't think this expansion will offer much replay value, but you should be able to get a few hours out of each map at least.<br /><br />It's not great, it's not terrible, it's alright. It's not a must-have unless you really love Tropico, but hardcore fans may not like the new buildings.",2012-03-30,1013,extra_long,2012-03,games

I have seen every single last episode of this series to date and I'm not sure Why I gave it the benefit of the doubt. It goes from \""Okay,to Interesting, to Good, to Terrible, to Great, to Completely Awful\"" and that seems to be the episode cycle with this series. The balance of story writing and acting ability is never consistent with this show. Sometimes there's a really good episode and then one that is a complete flop. It's as though each episode has a different writer like this is a series of short stories all by different authors. Some time you hate you missed the show and sometimes you wish you didn't waste your time to watch it all. Then complied into that is the acting, and how bad it is. There are maybe but a handful of \""good\"" actors on this show and they are all Villians. With the exception of Mulan just about everyone else makes you want to cringe at the way they deliver their lines. It's as though Uwe Boll is directing this show. The acting is completely all over the place.<br /><br /> For starters Seeing less Henry and more story started to make this show seem more promising and then came season 2. Not only is Henry all over the place but as usual he is the most annoying character on the show. I get it this kids supposed to be a key character but his acting is awful in every scene which makes watching him just make you shake your head and hope the scene ends soon. Whether the writers have him doing some stupid and pointless idea or if he's just running around town nagging people with the same \""I want to help\"", \""your a story book character\"" it just gets old and quick. Why and I mean WHY would you give the worst actor on your show the most screen time? This kids acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like Kevin Costner! and I know \""he's just a kid\"" yeah and a terrible actor.

It has some redeeming qualities. But I am astounded by all the people who have given it either a 4 or 5 star review. Quite astounded! I am also an attorney/writer like Darcie Chan, but unlike her, I have a better idea what constitutes a good plot, realistic characters, tying up loose ends, punctuation, sentence structure, and the rules of English composition. I counted in excess of thirty errors in the first chapter. Which may not bother most people, based upon the positive reviews, but does bother those of us who are more literate.<br /><br />A real editor would have been on her like `white on rice' about her excessive use of the words `that & than', and weak adverbs, in particular those which in the end in the suspect letters ly, such as excessively, beautifully, passionately, ad nausea. Such an editor would have told her to eliminate the distracting spoon thieving by the priest; as well as explain most priests face a daunting job tending to their large flocks. Based upon this error, and the problems which would arise, with the priest spending so much time with an unmarried woman, I would assume the author is not Catholic, or at least a practicing Catholic.<br /><br />There is a feel good aura about the story. An old woman hurt early in her life, and then again later, leaving her with agoraphobia. But due to inheriting wealth, she's able to bestow her largess upon the needy folk in her little town. I have known some agoraphobic's in my six decade's, but none, even in a remote way, such as the protagonist in this novel. If I had the option to go with a one half between the stars, and you caught me on a wonderful day, I would have rated it 2½ stars. But since my choice was limited, I had to go down to a 2, rather than up to a 3. I will admit part of my reasoning is Darcie Chan, as a well educated person, should have done better.<br /><br />For any Nit Wits and/or illiterates out there who wish to flame me over this review, I would suggest reading the following first: Eats, Shoots, And Leaves, by Lynne Truss, the leading authority on punctuation; The Chicago Manual of Style Online, the `Bible' of good writers; The Elements of Style, by William Strunk, Jr., revised and edited by Chris Hong; and Manuscript Makeover, by Elizabeth Lyon. You will then be qualified to dispute what I said here. If you don't, and you attack me, you will just be showing your ignorance.<br /><br />PS: Why hasn't Darcie Chan utilized some of the fortune she has earned to have the book professionally edited? This was her stated desire in a Wall Street Journal newspaper article of December 9, 2011. As of that date, she had reportedly sold 400,000 copies. It still shows up as a bestseller six months later, only now at Barnes & Noble's.com's Nook, I think the price has gone up to $2.99, the majority of which she keeps as a royalty, although it is still listed for $0.99 on Kindle (?). Might it be possible she checked about making the badly needed corrections, and decided she would have to list it as a second edition, because of all the screw ups present now, and not want unnecessary negative comparisons? I don't know. It could be.<br /><br />PSS: Darcie Chan is employed by the U.S. Senate drafting environmental legislation. I spent 5 years working for a governmental agency. That experience, along with another 25 years in private practice, convinced me that the majority (although not all) of government lawyers are punching a time clock, and waiting for their early retirement.

There was a huge chunk missing between Sierra coming back to her home town & marrying her husband. That part may have explained where she finally found restoration & how she came to the discovery. Overall my opinion of this book hasn't really changed. I still think it was incredibly sad & heartbreaking. The only positive message was that if WE want to change ourselves, WE CAN. I wouldn't even say that it can be done through the power of Christ (altho that is what I believe), but that in Sierra's case it had to be self motivated. Again, the \""christians\"" she knew were NOT instrumental at all in getting her back to Jesus. It seemed like pure will power on her part. I did appreciate Pastor O's apology towards the end. It would have been helpful of Pastor O to have a servant's heart throughout as her pride didn't help Sierra at all, but better late than never.<br /><br />09/08/2012 - Let me preface by saying that I have yet to finish reading this book but have such STRONG feelings about what I have read thus far (about 60%) that I HAVE TO COMMENT.<br /><br />First, I am completely heart broken for Sierra (main character). This young woman has had a terrible past, awful upbringing & after finding Christ continues to be used by other \""christians\"" repeatedly. She is constantly belittled by Rollanda (abusive dance instructor, \""mentor\"" & lover who initiated the relationship by basically molesting Sierra), told she is living \""in sin\"" by Pastor O & other ministers who bring prophetic words that are supposedly from the Lord, and lives in constant fear that she can/will lose her salvation & possibly her LIFE because she constantly struggles with her bisexuality.<br /><br />The part that I have read thus far does NOT discuss Sierra's own relationship with the Holy Spirit. In fact, it seems that because she does not blindly follow the advice & prophetic words of others, she is in sin & bad things keep happening to her. Nobody encourages Sierra to seek the Holy Spirit's guidance FOR HERSELF. She is expected to follow the prophecies given & simply accept that they are of/from God. However, the Bible tells us differently.<br /><br />1 John 4:1  Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.<br /><br />1 Thessalonians 5:21 Test everything. Hold on to the good.<br /><br />Also, because it doesn't appear she is in the word very much, she allows herself to be abused repeatedly by Rollanda and accept what R says/does as from God & acceptable to make her a better servant/follower of Christ. While Pastor O & other ministers DO tell her to withdraw herself from Rollanda, their requests fall on deaf ears because Sierra has already decided that they are against her since they have been against most/many of the decisions she has made thus far. No, she shouldn't feel this way, but one can argue with another person, but there isn't much argument against God or the Bible.<br /><br />2 Thess. 3:6 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh DISORDERLY, and not after the tradition which ye received of us<br /><br />I will finish reading this book & I may come back & update this review IF my opinion changes, but I will say regarding what I have read thus far, I will NOT recommend this book to ANYONE I know. This story could have/should have been one of God's amazing love, forgiveness & grace, yet there is too much condemnation, fear & judgement.

The review slightly edited follows.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I just went through all 11 songs.  Here is my take:<br /><br />1. Two songs I will play without alteration.  I do not like one of the songs, musically.<br />2. Babs owns \""How are things in Gloccamorra?\"", making Julie Andrews' professionally competent rendition (the best I knew of, slightly above Judy Collins) sound pedestrian.  It was almost as powerful as listening to Rita Connelly sing some of her songs that I had heard others sing -- and even some of my early reaction to Rachel O'Donnell, before I grew used to hearing such a clear voice without the hangers-on.<br />3. Babs has a few \""annoying habits\"" that come from singing to a dumber and dumber audience (as time went on) instead of to a classically schooled composer.  One of these is showcasing her profound talent at singing a note in one range -- and then jumping two octaves for the next note.  As I would note to her given an opportunity to do so,  \""would you want to listen to this on a violin?\""  She'd probably laugh -- and then cry.  Her second annoying habit is when she changes the volume in her singing.  Babs is one of the few people who can hold a note at almost any possible volume.  The point is not that Babs CAN sing like this -- the point is that songs should not be written to be performed like this.  And great singers should not be encouraged to be annoying for reasons of FALSE MARKETING.<br />4. Babs is occasionally forced to have \""cowpoke choruses\"" stuck into the music.  \""Cowpokes\"" (I can not use the perjorative in a public forum) can not sing -- falsetto is not singing.  Falsetto is noise pollution.  The cowpokes are hangers-on -- in this case trying to piggy-back over one of the top five voices of all-time.  They insult their own intelligence.  They can not insult Babs's profound talent.<br />5. The new album is supposed to be a finished product.  What this USED TO MEAN was that the first thing one would hear from a bandleader would be his first note played on an instrument.  One does not buy a Streisand album to hear anything other than hearing \""Her Greatness\"" (she is) sing, and the SILENCE of the vocally talentless.  To hear gratuitous piling-on with pretend \""ownership\"" tags that I have come to understand as such, makes listening to the songs that Barbara sings AS UNDESIRABLE AS ADDING GRATUITOUSLY WAILING 'COWPOKEDS' AS CHORUSES, NO MATTER HOW \""SUBTLY\"" HIDDEN (faint choruses I have come to regard as being ways to use the diamonds (Babs) in order to get agenda-driven garbage onto a recording made by microphone -- often to \""make quota\"").  Since when did attaining quotas for \""cowpokes\"" (to be politically correct) have anything to do with playing music?  OVERTLY?  Marketing?  Sure.  Music?  NO.<br /><br />Should Babs resing the same songs (rewritten to get rid of the COMPOSER problems), and ditch the cowpokes and worthless chit-chat at the front of each song (annoying to listen to should I want to hear the music again), I would pay 20 times what I paid for this album.",2012-10-30,547,extra_long,2012-10,music

I was quiet excited because I'd heard good things about the series.  My problems started almost immediately though.  The Amazon download service told me that it would take close to a full day for the game to download. I was fine with this because I am aware that my internet is a little slow, but after my computer crashed a couple of times and the download restarted from the very beginning I had to buy a cooling fan to keep my computer from overheating and getting damaged.<br /><br />Two days later, the game had finally downloaded completely and I thought I was ready to play.  Unfortunately something had not downloaded correctly so the game wouldn't even start.  At this point I called EA and was instructed to manually uninstall the game from my computer and to try again.  They even walked me through the process because I was unsure how to do it correctly.  That done, I tried the Amazon download again and had the same problems with it telling me that it was going to take a full day or more.  And again, the downloaded version of the game did not work, but this time it wouldn't even let me try to reinstall from the download.  I called EA again, this time they apologized profusely and provided me with a copy of the game through their download service, Origin. The copy through Origin took as long to download as the others had but actually runs the game as it is supposed to.<br /><br />Since trying to download this game from Amazon my computer has been sluggish, over heated far more often, and crashed more often.  I've enjoyed what little I've gotten to play in the Origin copy that EA provided, but am deeply disappointed in Amazon's download service.

Though there is some narrative, all the dialogue is presented like a screenplay.  If two characters are having a conversation over the phone, we jump back and forth between different settings for each line of dialogue (INT - Saturn Labs, for example).  The author also makes the decision to do all character introduction with character profiles - almost like what you'd see with a video game.  We're given a \""random fact\"" or two, the color of their eyes, where they were born, what type of clothing they like to wear.  This might have worked well, but there are over twenty-five characters introduced at the beginning of the book.  Retaining that much detail is impossible, so you go through most of the book without really understanding who most of the characters are.<br /><br />In 2045, gamma rays have caused humans to mutate in a very specific way - through gaining super-powers.  The book is sort of like X-Men meets Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.  The young mutants with the best powers are placed on teams to help defend America against robots and the schemes of the Global Defense Council (GDC).  The teams are built in a kind of weird way - like powers are placed with like powers.  This means that one team can have somebody who can stop time, somebody else who can create tornados at will . . . and the other team just has some demolition experts and some hand-to-hand fighters.  I would be pretty annoyed if I was placed on the regular combat team and the other team included multiple healers and people with the ability to control the weather.<br /><br />The book is over 800 pages long, but it is really just a couple hundred pages of story due to the huge amounts of white space inherent with the screenplay-like treatment.  The story itself is pretty silly - at one point the President, Vice President, Secretary of Defense, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (who conveniently all have a son on the teams) form a super-team and abandon their duties while New York is under attack to run around on the streets fighting robots.  The younger characters all act like they're about twelve years old, teasing each other about girls and running off from their missions to get candy bars.  At one point almost everybody dies and then a character reveals it was all just an illusion.  The adventure scenes are creative at first, but there are only so many mega-robots an ultra-powerful team can fight before it all starts to run together.hile New York is under attack to run around on the streets fighting robots.

In many ways it is a prelude to a story, because at only 8k words we really only get some background, the \""meeting\"" between the romantic pair, and the mating between the two.<br /><br />Neero's older brother Lex is the alpha of their little pack of misfits, and the power has gone a bit to his head. They've become somewhat disreputable after the death of their former Alpha, who was loved and revered, but with Lex's ascension to the role as their currently strongest wolf, the pack has fallen on hard times. They're broke and live in squalor and have very little protection. In the past, Neero has had to take numerous jobs to earn money to feed the pack, but lately he's been having to do it to earn money to feed Lex's obsession with showering the woman he's courting with the jewels and finery that she requests.<br /><br />Lex approaches Neero and compels him to sell himself for $10,000 -- enough money to keep Lex's girlfriend happy and buy her the diamonds she wants for her Halloween costume. Yet, the man that Lex ends up staying with is a complete surprise.<br /><br />Okay, obviously Lex is an bastard, right? Yeah, that's what I thought too. I felt like we got to know him enough that we could understand his motivations for what he did, but I also didn't quite feel like we got to know him any further, or enough for me to forgive him for being an utter bastard, a TERRIBLE brother, and an extremely poor leader of the pack. It isn't a huge deal, because he isn't the main character in this story, but he does relate directly to the actions of Leero and the man he goes to meet that night and then comes to mate with, simply because of the way they treat him.

I really enjoyed this book but, so help me, if I have to read about another father being in ICU and dying I'm going to stop reading books (at least for a while). I read while on the treadmill (several hours a day) and I hate crying while I am on the treadmill and it's become a nasty habit with stories like this getting me where it hurts. Anyway, at least that scene didn't dwell for too long (lost my dad last June so it's still raw in my mind). This story revolves around Nathan and Quinn, two lifelong friends. Their fathers grew up together and Nathan and Quinn were born the same year and were friends from birth. They did everything together even losing their virginity to each other BUT (and isn't there always a but) Nathan didn't want to be gay (like he had a choice) and wanted what his (very wealthy) parents had - a nice house, a husband/wife relationship dynamic, children, white picket fence etc. etc. etc. and he knew he could never have it with Quinn (or so he thought). So, on graduation night, after they gave each other their virginity, Nathan ran away.  Turns out Nathan joined the Marines, stayed in 4 yrs, married some woman, divorced her, moved back home (when he had gone to the police academy and then offered a position back in TN... Quinn's dad was the town sheriff) and met and married his second wife. He didn't want to take over the family business which was another reason for running away. Quinn, on the other hand, went off to TX to start his music career in roadhouses. He moves to Nashville and becomes successful but, in a bid to forget what he can't be (because he, also, does not want his dad to find out that he's gay) he becomes quite the slut and humps just about anything (human), both men and women... mostly strangers. And he's high most of the time. He also happens to get some addict pregnant. His music's really taking off and he's hit rock bottom. He decides to get help and goes to rehab. His daughter is born. The addict kills herself so he ends up with a daughter who he palms off on a nanny.  Quinn's mother died when he was young. She died of mumps complications. Nathan caught mumps off her and ended up sterile. His second gets really pissed off when she finds out Nathan is sterile and divorces him and takes him to the cleaners (gets all his inheritance money). She also happened to have seen Quinn kissing Nathan on their wedding day (not that Nathan reacted because he didn't. He'd wanted his marriage to work out).  At the start of the story Quinn's dad has been shot and is dying in ICU. This tale, of two men who really should never have been apart but who really had to be in order to find their ways back to each other and into acceptance of what they wanted and needed, is beautiful. I didn't like the rape scenes (though the rapes weren't described during the time of the crime but as a memory coming back) and the carving and violence were tough to read. Just loved this story and the two men, Nathan in particular. Also liked Nathan's family and the fledgling relationship between his sister and the FBI guy. Wonder what the sequels will bring.

I had heard that this was Gosling's year. He is simultaneously in two big popular movies. I chose this one because it is the one that doesn't also star George Clooney. After watching Gosling in this film - I'm still not sure, can he act? The character he plays is so odd as to be unrecognizable as a person.<br /><br />After about ten minutes into the movie Gosling still hadn't said a word on camera. I thought to myself, maybe now that he's this hot new movie star he will soon move up to speaking parts. Yes I know he's trying to be cool, but he's so emotionally unavailable it just comes off as robotic. I've been alive a long time and I've met a lot of people, the only people I have ever met who were this odd were those guys I met that summer when I worked in a mental institution. I have read about weird loners like this in some true crime accounts of serial killers. Gosling plays the driver as a very strange dude indeed.<br /><br />This movie makes you think, or rather this movie gives you a lot of time to think because of all the extremely slow scenes in which nothing happens. You start to think about other getaway driver movies. This film is very similar in many ways to the Ryan O'Neal film \""The Driver\"". The protagonist in that film also didn't say much. In contrast Jason Statham in the \""The Transporter\"" was rather chatty. In each of these movies the dramatic arc is that getaway driver is set up as a quiet rather precise sort of fellow who suddenly reveals himself to be a killing machine. Statham - who was an Olympic athlete - takes off his shirt and beats the snot out of a dozen guys at once. It's all very amusing if not very plausible. Ryan O'Neal - who was a former professional boxer - is more credible as a guy who explodes into violence. Another similar film was James Caan in \""Thief\"" where he plays another one of these cool self controlled professional criminals who in the final reels reveals a hitherto unsuspected capacity for violence.<br /><br />So this movie is a genre movie and Gosling's driver is someone we have seen before. But each movie must top the previous movie (some Hollywood law) and so Gosling when he is cool in the early scenes is beyond normal cool - he's catatonic. And when in the later scenes when he violent he's psychotic. In the character's defense I must reveal that everyone else in this movie is also psychotic. He fits right in.<br /><br />What's so odd about the character? First of all he cares nothing for money. In the previous three films I cited the drivers were always very careful about money. This seems reasonable. They are all criminals aiding robbers. People rob for money. But Gosling's character is indifferent to money. There are at least three scenes in which he establishes that he is not interested in money. What then does he care about? Not people. He's very much a loner with no friends. Of course it's hard to make friends if you never speak. He's also not interested in women at least in any kind of sexual way. He has a platonic relationship with his next door neighbor but he's not a lover - more like an old friend of the family. The romance in this film rings very false.<br /><br />What does he care about? Well, he seems to like to kill people in grotesque ways.<br /><br />Steve McQueen often played cool quiet characters. Indeed he was the first choice for O'Neal's part in \""The Driver\"", but McQueen was still emotionally available. He communicated to the audience that he felt things and cared about things even when he didn't show much. Of course he never was saddled with a character as bizarre as that of Gosling's driver. So maybe it isn't Gosling at all. Maybe it's just the screenplay that's so peculiar. Maybe Gosling played it exactly right. In that case I take back every criticism of Gosling himself and transfer it all to the screenwriter. In any case this film stinks.screenwriter.

While the concept of the game (future warfare, stealth rather than run and gun, x-ray, etc) are amazing, the execution completely ruins it. Ultimately, Ubisoft took what could have been the next big FPS and turned it into a magnitude 10 headache.<br /><br />Let's start with the installation. If you got the Amazon copy of this, via either DVD or Direct DL, then you can't auto patch it to the latest version. The UPlay auto patcher will run, download an update or two, and then you'll be stuck at some in between version, instead of the latest 1.2. This disables you from any form of online interaction. So I proceed to uninstall, reinstall the game fresh, and then instead of running the default patcher, download the latest patches from Ubisoft direct. This at least got me to 1.2<br /><br />Then comes all the glitches that were never worked out. Despite claiming that this would not just be a simple PC port, and using this as an excuse for the over a month delay in release date, once we get the game, behold it IS just a port (there is a class action lawsuit pending on this aspect). This means a whole gamut of glitches, causing the game to freeze, hang, crash, return nonsensical errors, on all versions (Amazon DL, Steam, Retail copies).<br /><br />One of the main drawing points of this game (and one of the most heavily advertised by Ubisoft) is the multiplayer co-op. Good luck getting it to work. First, after finally setting up an UPlay account, it took two days to figure out how to add friends. If you add them through the UPlay website, they will show up both on the site and in game, but it will always be listed as offline, and you will never be able to join a game together. You will then have to REMOVE them first, then find them through the game's find friend option, and add them through there instead.<br /><br />Once you have each other added, it takes another bit ofsearching to find an \""official\"" (forum) thread on what ports to forward, and there's about 30 of them (for the game, for the patcher, and for the launcher).<br /><br />So now you have everything patched. One of 3 things will happen:<br /><br />If you are playing via Steam: Every 20 min or so, random error pops up, crashing one of the players and ending the entire co-op.<br /><br />If you are playing retail/Amazon: The game will either:<br />1) De-sync mid mission (this means that while the host will see enemies, the other players will not, and they will only see a completely empty map. Even if the host kills all hostiles, moving to the check point will not trigger the next sequence, forcibly trapping you in that one particular part).<br /><br />2) Infinite load. After clicking start in the lobby, you will both be stuck on either \""Loading\"" or \""Waiting for players\"" screen. This is entirely random, and will happen 80% of the time. You may get lucky once in a while and manage to get in 1 whole mission together, before it hangs on the next one again.<br /><br />Overall, this game has brought me more headache and grief than joy. This is the last Ubisoft game that I pay money to play.",2012-07-01,577,extra_long,2012-07,games

They form cohorts and they attempt to assassinate their rivals.<br /><br />Khemri is our viewpoint character, and we follow him around as he is variously tested and reborn through the Princely Reboot System that has to do with him being jacked in.

You can reject that which you have known and become your own person, or you can work toward accepting what you need to learn and integrate with.

US,11416963,R158KAYZMRQ52T,B006IGZWB2,7920965,The Help,Digital_Video_Download,5,0,1,False,False,Fanatstic Movie,"The Help, directed by Tate Taylor, was a fantastic movie. The acting was marvelous, the plot was more than interesting, and the message was one that needed to be heard by all, no matter the color of their skin. The movie, which took place in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1962, was about the black maids that worked for the (sometimes) rich white women. The employers, such as Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Elizabeth (Ahna O'Reilly), are not always so nice to their maids, Minny (Octavia Spencer) and Aibileen (Viola Davis). Along comes Skeeter (Emma Stone), aspiring novelist and journalist, who is currently stuck with a job writing a housekeeping column for the Jackson Journal. Skeeter's idea, to write an anonymous book about what it is like being a black maid in Jackson, first does not go over well with the maids; it's just too dangerous. Slowly, they join this project, but meanwhile, they all have to deal with issues, like money, family issues, and crazy or mean employers. This movie was based on the book by the same name by Kathryn Stockett. As I read the book before seeing the movie, I wondered what parts they would keep and what they would take out. Obviously, not everything could stay- it was a 525 page novel squeezed into a two and a half hour movie. I was very impressed by the way that they used direct quotes from the book in the movie. The message, one of how anybody can be equals, no matter their race, was a very important one that people should take through their whole lives with them. People think that nowadays, now that we have laws against segregation, racism has suddenly just evaporated from the world. There was one line in the movie that stood out to me, that was supposed to be funny, when Hilly is talking to Skeeter, and she says, \""You know, there are real racists in this town.\"" If that's what she honestly thought, when she herself was quite against black people only because of their skin color, that should make us think about ourselves a little bit deeper.   Although this movie is only two and a half hours, for those few hours, you feel transported back fifty years and as if you were dropped into the middle of these women's lives. I think that the length was perfect- short enough that it didn't seem meandering, but long enough that you felt angry at the parts when Minny was angry, excited when Skeeter was excited, and content when Aibileen was. It was as if they were your best friends for that period of time you spent in the theater. The ending was not completely satisfying, as you are still wondering what will become of them, but it really made you think, which I'm sure is what the director was going for.   For this movie, I think that those who make up ratings for movies did a good job by rating it PG-13. There is a small amount of domestic violence and the police are very rough with someone, but overall there is not much violence. There is also a scene where one of the characters gets drunk while driving, which is a bad influence for young kids. Parents' biggest concern, though, would probably be the amount of cursing. Many of the characters curse as part of their speech, but there is one word that really moves the plot along, so it is used quite often. Personally, I think that kids are used to cursing, as they hear a lot of it starting around the age of ten, but parents might not want to intentionally expose their kids to these words yet. The ideal minimum age for this movie, in my mind, is probably either eleven or twelve. There really is no maximum age, as I believe that it is a movie that anyone can enjoy. The novel itself was an adult novel, yet when the movie came out, it was loved by both teens and adults.   The acting portrayal in this movie is terrific. The actors show a great amount of feeling, and they say their lines with heartfelt emotion. Out of all the very talented actors and actresses in this movie, I would say that the best was Viola Davis, as Aibileen. You can really see that she feels she isAibileen. One of the best scenes in terms of acting, though, is one without Aibileen at all. This is the scene where Yule May asks Hilly for a loan. Yule May is trying to put her twin sons through college, and she is short just seventy five dollars. She asks Hilly, her cruel employer, for a loan. Not only does Hilly say no, she has the nerve to tell Yule May that \""it's for her own good\"". The way Hilly speaks to Yule May, in such a phony, condescending way, makes you despise her, wonder how anyone could possibly act the way she does and not feel disgusted with herself. Aibileen put it perfectly: \""You a godless woman, Hilly Holbrook.\""",2012-01-11,847,extra_long,2012-01,videos

They were discovered and quickly signed by Swedish label Transubstans Records, who released their self-titled debut album on the Troglodyte imprint in February 2012.<br /><br />And what we're dealing with here is a good, old fashioned band that have a clear emphasis on high energy rock and roll. Dirty and grimy, but also with a few tender touches and passages that documents a band with good instrumental skills. But at the core of everything there's energy and aggression. With high octane, at times almost frantic drum patterns giving the bassist a good run for the money as the busiest instrumentalist of this foursome. I might add that this is a band fond of a loud drum sound too, cue a band like The Who. The guitarists provides the main parts of the variation at hand, providing hammering staccato riffs and easygoing circulating riff patterns with ease, but when it's time fo an instrumental passage they'll frequently adds some more polished touches to the proceedings, adding melodic, harmonised layers on top of the high energy rhythm foundation. As well as dampened, gentler psychedelic oriented sequences on a few occasions.<br /><br />Then there's the lead vocals, and in this case this is a like or loathe aspect of this band's performance. The lead vocals are shouted, and in a manner that documents quite nicely that passion and aggression is far more important than melodies and staying in tune. Punk is probably a key word here, if you really enjoy punk music and punk lead vocalists then this will be a perfect band to explore, if you can't stand it then John Duva isn't an act that will interest you.<br /><br />The end result is an album filled with high energy material, with stylistic roots that can be tracked back to good, old The Who, following theline of development that encompasses garage rock and punk rock. Aggressive, deceptively primitive in expression, with a few touches of instrumental class that makes me suspect that this quartet also know a fair bit about bands like Turbonegro.

It should have taken shooting to new heights, with impressive and immersive audio to help you sink into the ungodly destruction and chaos of the virtual combat this franchise is known for.<br /><br />Should have been, because that's what fans of the series are used to, and it's what DICE has proven themselves good at. It's also what EA promised relentlessly in their $200M marketing campaign.<br /><br />MULTIPLAYER<br /><br />Instead they took several major leaps and bounds backwards, watered down the gameplay, nerfed destruction back to something laughably mediocre (holes in walls only, no collapsing), increased the light-speed frenetic twitch-factor of combat (a la Call of Duty), have flip-flopped on making vehicles damn near indestructible to made out of paper mache, and more or less removed any chances of successfully playing objectives the way Battlefield is meant to be played: with teamwork and strategy.<br /><br />The aforementioned detriments to the gameplay all stem from the one holy grail of EA's publishing ideology, and that is to \""take down\"" and \""beat\"" Call of Duty. The result was asinine market research and developing schedules dictated by execs and lawyers, not the developers themselves. The game started out as PC-primary. Then quietly, and not revealed until much later, it was later console-primary. The UI (user-interface)  was outsourced to a company called River, who does chintzy, small time flash work for various companies. A long-standing mystery after the game launched was how DICE managed to make a UI so obscenely clunky, disorganized and frustrating to use. Just shy of a month ago the outsourcing to River was revealed. Makes more sense now, but also seems a lazy slap in the face to fans who were expecting a working product. It also makes one wonder what other creative endeavors were given away on the cheap. The maps? They are about as far from true BF fashion as one could expect. Empty fields with a stream thrown in across the middle and random clusters of empty buildings dotting the terrain here and about. There's no style, substance, or character to the maps that make each one stand out in different ways as \""that\"" map. (But at least you'll have no problem seeing the maps, as you could probably go outside right now, look at the large thermonuclear ball that is our sun with a pair of 50x binoculars, and be less blinded by that than by the ultra-realistic sun in this game. Jesus.)<br /><br />As such, the game was built not to be the \""true sequel\"" to Battlefield 2, but as a means of stealing market share from Activision. They set out to build a release date, not a game. This is (still) infuriatingly evident, as they are still building the game. One can call them \""patches\"" and \""updates\"" all one wants. But it's simply EA and DICE struggling to finish building the game not in the developer's house, but in ten million different households across the video gaming globe.<br /><br />To new players, the game probably seems super neato. Oh em jee, the bull3tz drop wen u sh00t. To fans of the frachise that know quality because we've played quality, it is a boring, broken, hackneyed effort to milk some cash out of a brand name. Small arms all sound the same, same guns with different skins. All reload animations are practically the same, a \""sleight of hand\"" speed Red Bull spasm of the elbow. No style. No manly mag-slap. Just one example of how lacking the game is in substance.<br /><br />The ridiculous quest to \""beat\"" Call of Duty has resulted not in a far superior game that would invariably draw players from that franchise over, but in a sickening case of cloning CoD gameplay to give CoD players what they are familiar with, damning the BF fans who have helped build this franchise and not giving them what they are familiar with.<br /><br />Bugs, glitches, broken mechanics, obscenely overpowered weapons, cheating, hacking-- all of these things are a deplorable mess, But the one thing that I myself can't forgive EA for doing, and forcing DICE to do is what has happened to the BF community.<br /><br />It is NOT the Battlefield community. Not anymore. Now it is a sludged-up cesspool of the most disgusting, antisocial, ineffective, me-me-me lone-wolf scum I have even seen in a video game, even beating CoD in that regard.<br /><br />If a graphical overview representation could be made of the action happening on previous battlefields, it would look like the chaos resulting from the clash of two powerful weather systems. There will be action. There will be shifting of power. There will be a victor. And there will be a loser. If the same overhead representation were made of BF3, it would look like footage of an obnoxiously loud and blinky pinball machine, sped up 200x. Everyone just flails, bounces, powerhouses, bangs, collides, and crashes into each other bombing around corners at lightspeed. Whomever has the Famas, or frag rounds, or M26 dart glitch out wins. That's it. If a weapon is overpowered you can count on virtually 99% of the community abusing it incessantly, racking up tens of thousands of kills with them, per player, because it beats everything else. The act of winning has gone the way of the dodo. \""Winning\"" in this game, with this community, is obsessing over your KDR and abusing and spamming whatever flavor-of-the-month OP'd weapon is in style. It isn't even about fun. Just stats. Stats stats stats. Whore your stats and you are \""good\"". Lose a match and it's everyone else's fault, not your own. That is the mentality of this community, and it makes it's ugly presence known, loud and obnoxiously clear. Variety and diversity used to be a staple trademark of BF gameplay. Now it's not. It's no different than a million players in CoD4 spamming the M16, or a million players in Black Ops spamming the AK74u. If it kills ridiculously fast, requires zero aiming/skill/strategy, it will be seen ubiquitously, in all corners of every match on every map. Note the references to CoD titles--<br /><br />That is because that is what this game has become. Call of Duty: Frostbite 2.<br /><br />I mentioned nothing of the failed, broken mess that is Battlelog or the infuriating scamware that is Origin simply because there is too much to say on that topic, bordering on what could damn well turn out to be a preface for a class-action lawsuit. Another day for that mess.<br /><br />RENT-A-SERVER SCAM<br /><br />Yes, it's a scam. A racket. With the most recent update DICE has introduced the ability to rent servers. 1 day, 7 day, or 90 days I believe. (Ironically, this is why the patch took so long, and they didn't even try to hide that fact. The patch was not meant to add some stability and fixes, but be the horse upon which the \""Rent-a-Server\"" update could ride. It is called that.)<br /><br />OK, fine.<br /><br />I do not wish to rent a server and no one can force me to. I like playing regular games with rules and mechanics that I'm used to and understand. But hark! What's this? Oh, silly me, DICE have pulled ALL OFFICIAL SERVERS from showing up in server browsing, and set up Quick Match itself to find only player-owned servers.<br /><br />Not all is lost. I do have choices in this situation. I have choices such as:<br /><br />OP METRO 24/7 TDM 1500 TKTS<br />BOLT ONLY sNiipes use othr gun GET BANNED!<br />CQ 400% HLTH NO VEHICLES allowed<br />KNIFE ONLY use a gun get banned<br />Hardcore Rush No shotguns/mavs/snprs ALLOWED<br />24/7 TDM caspian 1500 TICKETS<br />Snipers ONLY use RDS/holo GET BANNED<br /><br />... and so on.<br /><br />So never mind. All IS lost. Trying to a find a default game with default settings (ya know... just trying to play some effing BF) is virtually impossible. By pulling all of their own servers they have forced a disgusting racket upon the community, which, childish and selfish as it has become, has enthrallingly embraced it. Why? Because server owners have god power.<br /><br />MAKE NO MISTAKE: kill the owner in a match, YOU WILL BE BANNED. Take a tank or helicopter that 11-year-old iTzsHaDoWsNiip3zzz or 40-year-old LEGITbeerman420 wanted, YOU WILL BE BANNED. Be on the owner's team, but have more points than them near the end of the match, YOU WILL BE BANNED. Kill them with a shotgun, AR, SMG, LMG, sniper rifle, or gadget they do not like, YOU WILL BE BANNED.<br /><br />Do not merely take my word for this.

There is the near identical [[ASIN:B001ZWOSPK Anita O'Day With Gene Krupa & Stan Kenton]] and [[ASIN:B0035YMBKA The Swing Of Things (Best Of Anita O'Day)]]. Also, for hard core fans who want a more complete collection, the 4-disc set titled [[ASIN:B00005BCFR Young Anita]].<br /><br />Like the two single albums mentioned above, this one has an interesting flaw: the vocalist on track 6, Deep in the Blues, is Irene Daye, not Anita. Daye was Anita's predecessor in Gene Krupa's band. I will have to admit that I first thought it was Ella Fitzgerald when I first heard it, but Anita O'Day expert, Patrick O. Moore, cleared that mystery up.<br /><br />The sound quality is sufficient for me, but if you are an audiophile you may want to check out [[ASIN:B001ZWOSPK Anita O'Day With Gene Krupa & Stan Kenton]] instead. The solid selection, on the other hand, is representative of Anita's better work with both Krupa and Kenton. The highlight (in my opinion) from Krupa's band is the seminal Let Me Off Uptown done as a duet with Roy Eldridge, and from the Kenton band is And the Tears Flowed Like Wine. However, I am at a loss as to why Thanks fr the Boogie Ride was left off. Fortunately I have that from another album (and you may not find the omission to be that egregious anyway.)<br /><br />If you are willing to overlook the Irene Daye mistake then you will probably enjoy this album. Listen to the sound samples before making a final decision, as well as check out the other albums mentioned. Personally I do not think you can go wrong with any of the albums I mentioned above, and this (or one of the others) would nicely augment chapters V through VII in Anita's autobiography ([[ASIN:0879101180 High Times Hard Times]].)",2012-07-03,314,long,2012-07,music

For starters, I think the beginnings of each story were too sugary sweet, and not all that believable. A few of them also took awhile to get to the point.<br /><br />Secondly, there are at least two stories in here that sound like something I've watched on I Survived, but some of the key details are changed. I'm not sure why the author would do this, if these are claimed to be true stories.<br /><br />The next to last story I know for a fact is about Terry Caffey and the slaughter of his wife and son (he wrote a book called Terror By Night, and was also on I Survived). However, in this book, they change a lot of very key information. His wife and son were both murdered by his daughter's boyfriend and an accomplice, but in this book, the son somehow miraculously lives and takes down the killer himself, the accomplice is never captured, and his daughter alone gets life in prison. In real life, the boyfriend, the accomplice and his daughter are all in prison. I'm not sure why they felt the need to change such key information and still tout these as true stories. I understand the concept of changing the names, however. I believe that is why they don't give us any pertinent information as to where these people are located. I don't believe any of them are their real names.<br /><br />I will say that nonetheless, most of these stories are still very inspirational, and some may bring tears to your eyes.

I had certainly heard about their products, but they had always looked complicated and intimidating. Which they are. In a good way.<br /><br />Crusader Kings 2 (CK2) is similar in some ways to the Civilization games, you do control a country (or duchy) and attempt to build up its power over the years in an attempt to become the most powerful. CK2 goes one more step and actually has you playing the role of a specific ruler. As a King you have more duties than just conquering territory. You have to find a wife, provide and educate your heir. Once he's of age, marry your son off for maximum political gain. Hope he and his new wife get along so your dynasty can keep going. Work against your powerful vassals so they don't plot to overthrow you. And then invade your neighbors to gain more land.<br /><br />Oh, and go on crusades in the holy land too, from time to time.<br /><br />For those who might be frustrated by the game at first: give it time. Read some AARs on Paradox's forums. Watch some Let's Plays on youtube. See how others play the game. It's a tough nut to crack, but tasty once you get in there.<br /><br />Finally a note: while the game does use Steam for activation of the product, it is not required at all to run the game. You can just create a desktop shortcut of the game and run it directly from there. This is not the same shortcut that Steam would create for you. You will have to open up the game directory itself, and create the shortcut on your own. The Steam client does not need to be running at all to run this game.",2012-07-31,315,long,2012-07,games

Her passion for music goes back to the early days of her youth. For her, having the chance to interview bands and review their music, along with becoming introduced to new artists, combines the best of the music and writing worlds. She currently works for the Music section of BLANK Newspaper, Knoxville's longest-running independent publication, writing musician interview articles and album reviews.<br /><br />\""For a French man, Alain Rozan sure knows a lot about Rock and Roll. His album \""Riding The Wind\"" transverses all eras of rock music, from classic rock and rock ballads to jam band music and to blues.<br /><br />Multiple songs within the album are titled after the names of both fictional and both non-fictional famous people. One of these songs is \""Cinderella.\""  Rozan adds an unlikely twist to the fate of Cinderella, however. He explains that after her prince has left her everything goes downhill from there. She turns into a junkie and soon finds herself in an ambulance due to \""an overdose of poetry.\"" The other famous person Rozan exhibits in the album is Van Gogh in \""Van Gogh Blues.\"" The guitar of  Erik Della Penna adds twang to the song along with giving it a bluesy, late night bar type of feel. He sings of a band, their trouble getting signed and their trouble with losing women. After each of these, he relates the situation back to Van Gogh, saying that he was not successful right off the bat either. Rozan has the type of rugged, worn down voice that almost falls into the same category as Dylan; his raspy voice that sounds as if it has come from years upon years of chain smoking and blues drinking. He wears his voice well, though, and supports it within his music.<br /><br />Riding the Wind contains many songs that have to deal with people who have become down on their luck. \""Junk Bond Junkie\"" is another one of these. The song deals with a man who is out to get rich, noting that he has to do a line of cocaine just to make it through the day. An electric guitar solo by Ashley Moore is presented within multiple sections of the song after the chorus, giving it a well-rounded, robust rock character.<br /><br />The album's self-titled song comes four songs into the album. \""Riding The Wind\"" is an ambling tune whose melody along with its lyrics conveys a disheartening tone. He recollects his emotions and affection for a certain person. He describes numerous things that this person has done and says that he knows these things so well only because of that. He sings, \""If I don't know you now, I knew you so well then.\"" It has a delicate sound, though the ballad-like nature of the song makes it that much more impactful.<br /><br />Rozan displays an array of talent by placing original songs as well as two covers on his album. Placing a cover beside original work on an album allows listeners to compare Rozan's song writing abilities with those of others. Fortunately, he is able to stack up to the test. His own songs do not fall short in the least; if you have never heard one of his covers before, you would think that it was one of his own songs. The two covers on the album are Eddie Cochran's \""Summertime Blues\"" and \""Money Jam,\"" his own rendition of The O'Jay's \""For The Love Of Money.\"" He puts his own artistic license into effect on this song, though, by beginning with the song's chorus and following with a strictly instrumental solo consisting of various instruments that lasts the rest of the song.<br /><br />Likely due to his background, Rozan writes his lyrics and styles his songs in a crafty, poetic fashion that gives his songs depth.

And suppose you don't want a really steep learning curve? Magix MX Premium does all that and a lot more. I am absolutely blown away by what this software can do, and within about a half an hour after installation, I had \""composed\"" a percussion and synthesizer piece that would work for some videos of paintings that I had put together earlier.<br /><br />The Premium package differs from the regular version with more sounds & loops, more genres (including a style suitable for movie music) more templates, a better mastering suite. More sound loops are included, and more can be downloaded, either for free or for purchase from the Magix (Catooh) website. There is a very realistic guitar sound suite (synthesizer) as well as electric bass. Also, you can do up to 96 tracks per compositions versus 64 for the standard version. In addition, you get an analog compressor and synthesizer, a copy of Music Editor 3 that can be used to edit samples, and the ability to mix tracks in 5.1 Surround Sound, again something that makes this version more appealing to amateur film makers.<br /><br />The styles include hip-hop, ambient, chill, techno trance, alternative rock, blues, electro pop, downbeat electronic, minimal \""tech house\"", movie score.<br /><br />This version includes \""cloud\"" space capability: you can store projects online space for access and editing them as well as sharing online in YouTube and Facebook. Media-X-change also lets you share data between other MAGIX apps. You get Vita Solo instruments --extremely realistic instrument sounds (the grand piano is fantastic) as well as a Loop Designer.<br /><br />Installation:<br /><br />This is a download version; I downloaded directly from Amazon, using our FIOS internet service. It took about 20 minutes to get the software downloaded, another 40 minutes or so to install an upgrade plus a number of sound loops and extras that come with the package. The installation went smoothly, if lengthily. You can download the software again, from your Amazon digital storage, if you need to restore it after a computer crash. You can download three times using one license key; after that, you need to correspond with Magix.<br /><br />Using the Software:<br /><br />There are two learning curves; a shallow one that lets you follow templates or \""songmakers\"" to get up and running easily. Well, almost easily. I was able to compose, using pre-set loops, a very nice ambient percussion, vocal and synthesizer work with a repeating loop for part that is suitable for a home slide show. It took me a half an hour to get a pretty decent composition that would work for my video slide show.<br /><br />I was also able to hook up an old MIDI capable Yamaha keyboard (a 15 yr old one) and use a new MIDI/USB cable and use the keyboard, loading in synthesizer instruments and play them on the keyboard rather than use the virtual keyboard in the software (I play piano, so I prefer a live keyboard.) That only took a bit longer.<br /><br />The steep part of the curve is learning advanced mixing, equalizing and tweaking the sound using the editing portion as well as being able to understand wave forms to customize synthesizer sounds. Since I don't know much about sound and recording, I'm at a disadvantage. There is a lot of power, but I would need many tutorials to get to the point where I can optimize my music using all the features.<br /><br />There are also video special effects and feature--presumably to sync music to your video work; have not tried it yet.<br /><br />Reports are that version 18 (this one) is buggy, but I found it was rather smooth and if you are patient and do not try to hurry the process, the uptime seems acceptable. I crashed it once or twice in a few hours of use, which I consider average. (I've had much worse experience with some film-editing packages.)<br /><br />There are sometutorials and demos. I didn't find them particularly excellent. You may find better ones on Youtube if you do a search.<br /><br />Since you can upload your songs directly to almost any social network such as Facebook, YouTube, SoundCloud, there is an issue of royalty and copyrights. You can't publish videos to public sites that contain music you don't have the rights to use. You can however, use the compositions you make with Magix privately, although you can't sell any of the songs you may compose using the pre-composed elements in this software.

It is an abuse of people's compassion. The copyright holder, Greta Berlin, is an anti-Semite, apologist for terror and a fanatical Palestinian propagandist.  She is everything but a \""peace activist\"".  She and her book are a fig leaf for jihadist terrorism and should be treated as such.<br /><br />[Support for the assertions in this review is provided in the comments below]<br /><br />The Book:<br /><br />The Dedication:<br /><br />The hostility to Israel by these hypocritical \""peace activists\"" is evident from the first sentence, which refers to \""present day Israel\"" (but not \""present day\"" Gaza or anywhere else, i.e., broadcasting the author's desire that Israel's existence end).<br /><br />The \""dedication\"" also libelously suggests that Israel prevents Gazan children from being educated or parents from working.  This is baseless demonization and, in any case, there has not been a single Israeli in Gaza since 2005.  In addition, the arms blockade on Hamas' Gaza is enforced by Egypt as well as Israel and fully supported by the Palestinian Authority. (1)<br /><br />Preface:<br /><br />The preface is similarly replete with manipulation and abuse of reader compassion.<br /><br />Rather than hearing of the terrorist rocket attacks on civilians and the campaign of daily suicide bombings by Palestinian terrorists that lead to the blockade on Gaza, we are dishonestly \""informed\"" of \""dispossession\"", that Gaza is \""an open air prison\"" or that Israeli soldiers (who were attacked by Berlin's hero activists while boarding the flotilla in 2010) \""executed point blank\"" innocent activists.  The preface also refers to the blockade as \""vicious and illegal\"" although the UN's Palmer report found it to be both \""legal and appropriate\"".  (2)<br /><br />By peddling such evil lies and disinformation, Amazon is morally complicit in libel.<br /><br />Forward:<br /><br />The forward is science fiction.  In referring to the Israeli campaign of late 2008 to root out Jihadist rocket squads that were relentlessly firing on small Israeli villages (after 7000 rocket attacks), the preface paints a tale of Israel akin to the Nazis. We are told the Israelis made \""50 000\"" people homeless and killed children and civilians wantonly.  Except that Israel's campaign has been characterized by leading military experts as the campaign most careful to protect civilian life in military history. (3)<br /><br />The preface then shamelessly states that Hamas - that is, the HAMAS that these flotillas benefit, the HAMAS of countless suicide bombings, the HAMAS whose charter calls for the killing of every Jew in the world --  \""took over the governance of Gaza\"".  There is perhaps no better example of the cynical manipulation and abuse of the readers thanthis passage. In reality, Hamas carried out a violent coup where it murdered and dropped its opponents from buildings onto populated streets below in a show of thuggish, Iranian-backed tyranny.  (4)<br /><br />Similarly, readers are told that Gazans were driven to digging tunnels to smuggle in necessities.  In reality, the tunnels are cash cows for HAMAS, the Palestinian authority has called for shutting them down, and they have been responsible for the creation of up to 600 millionaires in Gaza.  Gaza is exporting produce and boasts 5 star resorts.  Though Israel left the strip in 2005, Israel still supplies Gaza daily with all necessities and more.  (5)<br /><br />The preface offers more baseless accusations and deliberate lies couched in cynically sentimental, humanist terms.  This while the \""human rights activists\"" referred to never lifted a finger to oppose the deliberate murder of Israeli children by jihadist groups that directly benefit from these flotillas.  In fact, the IHH, Greta Berlin's partner in organizing and staffing the 2010 flotilla, is under investigation in Turkey for funding Al Qaeda.  (6)<br /><br />Chapter 1 - by Greta Berlin<br /><br />Greta Berlin here commits the rare oversight of being honest. She admits that her flotilla stunts are not - as they are misportrayed to the naïve and gullible -- about human rights, but rather \""Israel's Achilles' heel, and we were exploiting it in the media.\""  That is, Greta's flotillas are nothing but PR stunts that callously use human shields to make life easier for Hamas and other bloodthirsty terror groups in Gaza.  Or as she herself said on May 27, 2010: \""This mission is not about delivering humanitarian supplies, it's about breaking Israel's siege on 1.5 million Palestinians.\"" (7)<br /><br />Anyone can safely transfer goods to Gaza after Israeli or Egyptian screening for weapons.  Berlin and her allies chose public confrontation in 2010, despite the fact that the \""activists\"" on board were screaming their desire to kill Jews and die as \""martyrs\"" to anyone who listened. (8)<br /><br />Berlin goes on to fantasize about Israel and Egypt's arms blockade being about \""stealing the natural gas of Gaza\"" instead of stopping the influx of Iranian weapons. But at this point I already expected more thinly veiled anti-Semitic tropes about the Jews and how they will resort to any evil to secure more money.<br /><br />I kept reading into chapter 2 by Berlin et al. but the manipulation became so repetitive, the sentimentalism so cheap and coerced, that I stopped.<br /><br />The author:<br /><br />Greta Berlin's own step-daughter has recounted that \""[t]he title of `Peace Activist' is the one I find particularly hypocritical. On numerous occasions I heard Greta launch the insults \""the god damned Israelis, and those F****** Jews\"" at the dinner table in front of my father (a Jew) and the few Israeli friends and relatives who ventured to visit.\"" (9)<br /><br />I have a screenshot of Greta admitting that the vicious attacks that her and her allies euphemistically target at \""Zionists\"" (to avoid charges of anti-Semitism) are actually demonization of Jews.  \""We all get who that is... we all do know you are talking about Jews.\"" (10)<br /><br />Greta Berlin supports terrorism.  I have a screenshot of her saying the unprovoked slaughter of Israeli Olympic athletes by Palestinian terrorists at the Munich Games in 1972 was \""fair game.\""  She also seems to suggest in the same screenshot that unarmed Israeli passengers are also \""fair game\"" to be killed. (11)<br /><br />These reviews:<br /><br />Greta Berlin has been working to censor and intimidate negative reviews of this propaganda book.  She has also had her friends (like Mary Hughes Thompson) write reviews (upon launch of the book) and tamper with reviews' ratings - something that Amazon should put a stop to immediately.

They deserve it!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Your dearest reader and biggest Josh fan<br /><br />Okay, so seriously this is probably one of those books that I will thinking about for days and days afterwards. I still can't stop thinking about it and it's the very next morning. I had no idea what I have been missing out on and am kicking myself for not reading this book before yesterday. Sea of Tranquiliy is a book you read until your eyes fall out. I stayed up until 4 am reading and had to be up at 7 for work and even though my morning sucked I had to find out the ending.

Josh Bennett, yummy Josh Joshy.. a[...] what was I saying? Oh yeah JOSH!... He is emancipated. He has lost everyone in his life who he loves. His parents died, little sister died, Grandparents died... everyone is dead. He is all alone, has millions of dollars in the bank but you wouldn't know it by looking at him and just wants to build furniture. He is closed off doesn't want to get close to anyone but he does. He gets close to his \""Sunshine\"" (Nastya) and it only makes me want him even more. Thank goodness he turned 18 in this book or I would feel a slight guilt on this one.... ha!<br /><br />Of course there is a best friend who says whacky things but this time it is Josh's best friend, Drew. I heart Drew, no I really do and all his man ho self... for his laughter, his jokes that were extremely important in the book because the book was quite dark and needed to be lifted, and of course for getting Josh and Nastya to admit what they feel.

In what universe should it be more expensive to download a DIGITAL COPY of something than to purchase a physically cut, printed, and bound book made out of real materials? It's even more expensive than the HARDCOVER COPY. By one penny! What the hell? It's offensive to me and I'm glad I checked this book out from the library instead of forking over a single cent.<br /><br />I only have one word for you if you are thinking about buying this book: DON'T. I can't believe the number of people who gave it five-star reviews. It doesn't even come close to deserving it.<br /><br />The beginning of the book is catchy and the premise is neat. But it does't take the author long to make you completely hate every character. I spent the entire story in a restless state of dissatisfaction, growing more and more irritated as the book progressed.<br /><br />Juliet is a whiny, annoying, self-centered idiot. Ariel, the girl whose body she inhabits, is the only one whom you feel any real empathy towards - and even she is a cowardly, spineless pushover who apparently did nothing besides feel sorry for herself and grovel at the feet of her 'best friend' Gemma. Who, incidentally, is a spoiled, privileged brat. Ben is obtuse and dull, Romeo is cartoonish in his supposed 'villainy', and I disliked all of them. I suppose Jay makes an effort to give these characters redeeming qualities, but it's not nearly enough.<br /><br />The storyline, I think, has to be the worst part. It starts out interesting and the quickly devolves into incomprehensible nonsense. Romeo sacrifices Juliet for eternal life - catchy! They then spend the next several thousand years battling one another to bring SOUL MATES TOGETHER? Ok, that's kind of cheesy, but I suppose we'll just roll with. Romeo and Juliet work for Mercenaries of Darkness (or something) and Ambassadors of Light, respectively - oh and these guys have been around since the beginning of time, fighting one another, and by the way the Light people have some sort of ulterior motive/agenda, and all your matchmaking/matchbreaking gives each side some sort of power to achieve whatever sinister thing they are working towards! Now we're getting ridiculous, especially since this all occurs in the last quarter of the book and gets absolutely ZERO explanation and makes almost no sense at all.<br /><br />And then the ending. Alternate universe! Yes, it's that easy. Painted yourself into a corner you can't write yourself out of? Here's a handy dandy alternate universe where you can have your happy ending without even BOTHERING TO TRY AND RESOLVE THE ENTIRE STORY YOU JUST WROTE. Are. You. Kidding.

The beginning is fairly believable (free of spoilers) and builds up fairly interestingly but as the tale stretches on, it's difficult to understand exactly who Bill Paxton's target audience is. (spoiler alert) Are we really to believe that you can decide that someone is a \""demon\"" from a few (supposed) snippets of a person's life? Doesn't circumstantial evidence or possible mental instability come into play at any point? You would have to be someone of either very low intelligence or very poorly educated to believe that those targeted by the killer are \""evil\"". That said, towards the end, we are shown short scenes which supposedly prove that those targeted by the dad are \""demons\"" but essentially, what we see are the usual cross-section of individuals targeted by religious fanatics in the news as \""evil\"" (people who \""kill babies\"", people who dare to have sex for reasons other than procreation, guys who live at home with their moms rather than follow the whole \""wife and two kids in the suburbs\"" ritual of adulthood, etc. etc, etc,) Are you bored yet? I know I was. I was really hoping to get an interesting mystery about what it's like to have to live with mentally unstable parents but instead what I wound up with was an hour and a half, Christian conservative propaganda film justifying the vilification, judgement (and murder) of human beings whose lives and personal choices we do not agree with. Scary stuff indeed, but not for the reasons intended by Bill Paxton to be sure. The interesting thing I've learned here today, is that apparently dumb, rednecks now can make blockbuster films in place of thoughtful, well-educated worldly individuals. Yeesh! Bill Paxton really should stick to acting because writing (and directing) really aren't his forte.

While there is an element of comic book cheesiness to the whole storyline, this game is quite challenging and surprisingly fun to play.  This game made me cuss quite a bit, as death often comes quickly and - for someone like me whose love for video games has always surpassed his gaming prowess - quite regularly.  While it can be frustrating to play the same sequence over and over again in order to overcome your mistakes, each death made me more and more committed to finishing what I started.  A game without challenges is no fun at all, and I must say that Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is pretty darned fun.<br /><br />This time around, Lara - with a little help from some bad guys - has accidentally awoken the god Xolotl from his centuries-long imprisonment inside the long-lost Mirror of Light.  Unless you can stop him before the sun rises, the world is in for a world of hurt.  Fortunately, you have Totec, Xlolotl's ancient nemesis, on hand to help you; unfortunately, Totec's plan basically consists of you tackling all of Xolotl's traps while Totec takes a much easier path in order to try and cut Xolotl off.  The big guy basically does nothing while you face the imminent dangers of toxic swamps, molten lava, crumbling pathways, and all kinds of monsters big and small.<br /><br />The visuals on display here are very nice, and the controls - while frustrating at first - become second nature once you've cleared the first level or two (if you're using a controller, that is - I would not want to try and play this game with a keyboard and mouse).  I'm not sure why an ancient god would have submachine guns and rocket launchers stashed away in his stronghold, but these and other weapons (as well as health and ammo powerups) are there for the finding and taking as you progress.  To find the best ones, you'll have to prove yourself in reward challenges that often require you to analyze and figure out how to get where you need to go without being impaled, crushed, or burned to a crisp.  You also have achievements for the earning on each and every level, a feature which certainly adds to the game's replayability.  I actually enjoyed the game more the second time through, but that's partly because I got to restart with all of the weapons I had already procured the first time around.

He asks for mercy, but I instead send him to the oubliette. My victorious armies are out on campaign, lead by my militarily savvy brother, and are poised to conquer neighboring territory for the Kingdom. Wedding bells are ringing in the churches of my capital ; my niece has just been married to my son. Yes, its just another regal day in the game of Crusader Kings 2. One of Paradox's latest entries in the grand strategy series, CK2 boasts an enormous amount of options and freedom in player choice, giving you numerous ways  to make your mark on medieval Europe.<br /> The core of the game surrounds your control of a Medieval dynasty, and their ascent through the ranks of nobility over multiple generations. With a great deal of historical accuracy put into CK2 (you can even access the Wikipedia pages of historical characters in-game), you can choose from any number of dynasties that reigned during the course of the game's covered history (1066-1453). Not only does this give you the ability to tailor the game experience, but it adds a great deal of replayability .For example, newer players can choose to start as one of many lowly counts, while more experienced armchair monarchs can jump right into the dynastic action as a King.<br /> On it's surface, CK2 is an intimidating game. You may want to brush up on your understanding of the feudal system, and you will definitely be learning a lot of geography from the massive map that spans from western Europe to the fringes of Asia. A distinct lack of tutorials will leave you flustered at first, wondering how you can achieve your goals within the mechanics of the game. It doesn't help that several of the games more useful features are accessed by clicking on obscure buttons.<br />  Thankfully, once you do get a grasp on the fundamentals of the game, it is a truly rewarding experience. It is extremely satisfying when you can use the sandbox nature of the game to its fullpotential. Marrying into families to gain territory, installing your kinsmen on the thrones of other kingdoms, and forging empires based on your conquests are just a few of the things you can accomplish with a little guile, and the right timing.<br /> Even as a purely single player experience, CK2 is a very strong title. But what makes the game truly entertaining, and downright dripping with potential for those who like to game with friends, is the multiplayer. The multiplayer essentially gives all the freedom of the single player experience, but with a friend, allowing you to go to war together, intermarry families, and generally have a great time taking over Europe. Few multiplayer games offer you the fun that can be had in teaming up with friends in CK2, and it adds to an already staggering amount of options when it comes to starting up a new game.<br /> Crusader Kings 2 is not for everyone. If you hate history, this is going to be a boring game, and for the hardcore FPS fans ; you are probably wandering a little too far out of your genre. However, for the rest of the gamers out there, this is a must have title that is constantly being updated and tweaked by developers, and modded by fans.

Long's unexpected intervals and melodic choices make this more than just a pretty collection of foofy pieces -- instead, there's real depth and spare beauty -- she lets her melodies and progressions speak for themselves.<br /><br />I was being thrifty a month or so back, so at first I bought just a few pieces from this album to add to my latest listening playlists (notably, \""One Day,\"" \""To Dust,\"" and \""Everything\""), but after awhile, I actually not only did NOT grow tired of the four I'd originally bought, I wanted more.

Even so, I was desperately hoping that making you mine would restore my love for this series and help me overcome the frustration that I had with the one book.

This young girl's life was a tragedy, and I was rooting for this relationship for not only her happiness but also for her safety.

Never have a seen a better match than Grace and Sal not only in character, but for such an esteemed man to find a woman like Grace as pure as a white rose.

A scene-for -scene copy of the 1935 version wouldn't be as interesting. Hitchcock's \""North by Northwest\"" and \""The Man Who Knew Too Much\"" were variations on this story. John Buchan was more than a novelist, compare him to Ian Fleming. Buchan's novels reflect the WW I era, parts are dated now. The character of Franklin P.

The good news is that the Amazon download went fine. Took 5 mins to download and it saved the 85 MB file to my desktop.  I then burned that file to a CD in case I ever want to reinstall it.  The install also went smoothly without one glitch. It took 4 mins to install and I chose not to automatically update after the install. The install never asked me for a CD key so I don't know if it's stored in a cookie or it just doesn't require one.

But there is an annoying software registration window on every launch with no way to skip registration forever.,2012-02-04,49,short,2012-02,software

However, once I got it I was swamped with numerous crashing issues because the game refused to update properly. For some reason, Rockstar's DRM program (which is required to play) kept being unable to install itself and update the game files because the files were corrupted somehow.<br /><br />The first time I installed the game I was somewhat able to play because the DRM was so corrupted it didn't even install itself. Then one day it decided to work again and all of my save files got deleted because my default account was no longer valid and it forced me to install the DRM and create a new account and therefore NEW save files! And even worse, I was almost done with the game!<br /><br />I seriously wanted a refund from this game but Amazon is not responsible for the bugs and I'm sure Rockstar could talk circles around the issue too. My advice? DON'T BUY this game on PC. The problems you will inevitably have are not worthy of such an otherwise great game as this one.",2012-05-08,201,long,2012-05,games

The program worked great and I was done in no time.  It was very easy to use and efficiently step through the process.  I have used H&R Block (TaxCut) for the last 5 years.  However, the way they price the program is terrible.  I looked at H&R Block's web site and found their cheapest price.  I search on Amazon and found it over %50 cheaper!  Plus, once you buy the program, you will later have to pay for your e-filing fees, sometimes for State as well as Federal.  I have asked them for years to simplify this into one price.  Why they offer up to 5 different returns but then charge for all the e-files is not right.  Seems you are constantly opening your wallet and putting in your credit card number to pay for this or pay for that.  I would not recommend this product to anyone else.",2012-04-29,162,medium,2012-04,software

Or, those of us who fancy we'd make good kings if given the chance.  If you like Strategy Games and the historical era covered (roughly 1100-1450), you will like this game.  I say this with confidence. Even if you like just the historical era or strategy games, you'll almost certainly love this game.<br /><br />Pros:  If you love strategy, the list of pros is massive.  Paradox has always made deep and complex strategy games and while Crusader Kings II is no exception, they've also improved the interface, added tutorials, and have a huge community driven support system that make even a first time gamer able to ease into CK2.  There is also a strong community of modders that have added dozens of small improvements that that add subtle changes to a second play through or massive changes that virtually make for a different game.  Between the mods and an already extremely flexible game, you'll find vastly different experiences each playthrough.<br /><br />Cons:  Steam.  You're not buying an Amazon digital download but a steam download, with all the headache that brings.  Steam itself has pros and cons but mostly it is a hassle.",2012-05-15,201,long,2012-05,games
